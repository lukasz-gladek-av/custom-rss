He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you prefer gaming on a PC instead of consoles, you should hook it up to a display that can support playing games at higher frame rates for a smoother experience. Most gaming monitors require you to choose between prioritizing resolution or fidelity, but you get both with <strong>Alienware’s</strong> <strong>AW2725Q</strong>. The 26.7-inch 4K OLED display has a refresh rate of 240Hz, with just .03ms of latency (lag), so fast-paced games should look smooth instead of stuttering — so long as you have the graphics power to support it. The monitor is on sale for $675.84 ($224 off), an all-time low price at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F148HG5M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. <em>Verge </em>Commerce Editor Cameron Faulkner tested it and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/531783/alienware-qd-oled-monitor-27-4k-aw2725q-specs-impressions-buy/">was impressed</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->676</span></p><div><p>Alienware’s AW2725Q is a 26.7-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate, .03ms of latency, two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, and support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.</p></div></div><p>The AW2725Q supports Dolby Vision and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, which improve contrast and color accuracy when playing compatible titles. Dolby Vision is pretty common on 4K TVs, but it’s not as readily available on gaming monitors. An OLED display can display true black, which makes colors pop even more. An anti-reflective coating on the display also improves its contrast. The AW2725Q supports Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro, technologies designed to reduce instances of screen tearing or other graphical glitches.</p><p>The monitor has two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, one 5GBps USB-B port, three 5Gbps USB-A ports, and one 5Gbps USB-C port. If you hook your PC up to it using the DisplayPort, it’ll leave the HDMI ports open to connect a pair of consoles. Both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X top out at playing 4K games at 120Hz, while the Nintendo Switch 2 supports 4K output at 60Hz, so you can play games at their full resolution and frame rate on the AW2725Q.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2><strong>More deals to check out </strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>If you want to beef up your home security, <strong>Wyze’s Cam Pan V3</strong> is $29.98 ($10 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WYZE-IP65-Rated-Security-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0B9TWY11Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fwyze-cam-pan-v3-indoor-outdoor-wifi-1080p-pan-tilt-zoom-security-camera-white%2F6530519.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The HD camera can move up and down, and sits on a base that rotates 360 degrees. It will send you a notification when it detects motion and follow the subject as it moves. The footage it collects can be stored on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD card</a> (sold separately), so you don’t need to pay a monthly fee to keep videos in the cloud.

You can use the Google Home app to set the Nest Thermostat on a schedule, so your home’s heating and cooling system is only turned on when you’re going to be home. The app also lets you make adjustments when you’re out of the house in case your plans have changed. </span></li><li><span><strong>Amazon’s 55-inch 4-Series 4K TV</strong> can turn your living room or bedroom into a smart home hub, and it’s back down to $359.99 ($100 off), its all-time low price at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.

Alexa can be used to find the shows you want, change the TV’s inputs and volume, or control compatible smart-home accessories using your voice.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8bitdo%E2%80%99s-first-wireless-xbox-controller-is-a-surprise-rare-collaboration.1261623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has created its first wireless Xbox controller in partnership with Rare, a game studio acquired by Microsoft. The officially licensed controller features a gold and blue design, with plenty of Easter eggs to celebrate Rare’s 40th anniversary.</p><p>The $89.99 8BitDo Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition (yes, that’s the product name!) can connect to an Xbox console via a 2.4GHz wireless connection or a USB-C cable. The wireless connection works through a small USB dongle and not Microsoft’s native Xbox Wireless protocol. You can also use Bluetooth to connect the controller to mobile devices.</p><p>This Rare special edition controller is essentially a wireless version of 8BitDo’s existing Ultimate three-mode controller. 8BitDo is using the same hall effect joysticks and Xbox-style impulse triggers, but there are also two swappable silicone joystick caps included. One is a skull from <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and the other is a jigsaw puzzle piece that Rare fans will immediately recognize from <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. The tactile D-pad is made from zinc alloy and matches the controller’s gold aesthetic.</p><p>You’ll also be able to program three profiles on this controller, which includes configuring the two back buttons at the rear. All of the customization can be done using 8BitDo’s Ultimate software that lets you remap buttons, adjust the ranges and motor tensity of triggers, set vibration levels, and customize each stick for more precise control.</p><p>As this controller is wireless, it has a 1,000mAh battery inside, which 8BitDo suggests will deliver 20 hours of playtime. The rechargeable battery takes around 4 hours to fully charge, and there’s even an integrated charging dock included in the box that automatically reconnects the controller once you remove it from the dock.</p><p>It’s surprising to see Rare, an Xbox game studio, turn to 8BitDo to create a 40th anniversary controller instead of Microsoft just creating its own. The collaboration comes as Microsoft’s own custom Xbox Design Lab controller has been on hold for months now. You can still design custom controllers, but Microsoft hasn’t been accepting purchases since last December — with no sign of when Xbox Design Lab will return.</p><p>8BitDo’s Rare 40th anniversary Xbox controller goes on sale today, priced at $89.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>
