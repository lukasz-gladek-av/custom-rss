            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/604239/sony-bloodborne-60-fps-mod-removal-dmca-takedown-lance-mcdonald<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A popular <em>Bloodborne </em>framerate mod is no longer available thanks to a DMCA takedown request from Sony. Australia-based Twitch streamer Lance McDonald first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tqppZDYxw">developed the mod back in 2020</a> before <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1359037954576928769?mx=2">making it available to download in 2021</a>. Lance <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806">announced today in a post on X</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment asked them to remove download links for the patch.</p></div><p>The hack’s sole purpose was to get <em>Bloodborne </em>running at a smoother 60 fps with improved frame pacing. FromSoftware originally released <em>Bloodborne</em> back in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, and the game has always been locked at 30 fps with occasional stuttering from inconsistent pacing (the 30 frames within each second were not always on-screen for equal amounts of time). The beloved game’s graphical limitations have persisted even on the PS4 Pro and while playing it via backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Lance’s mod has received its share of testing and praise from the “Soulsbourne” community that covet FromSoftware games but wish their technical and graphical chops were more cutting-edge. This includes being spotlighted by creators like Digital Foundry, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDIvDPRcPA">interviewed McDonald about his hack back in 2020</a>, used his mod to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOn2ludP6gM">a 4K / 60 fps representation on PS5 using AI upscaling</a>, and recently published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjzBbdl7hk"><em>Bloodborne</em> PS4 emulation video</a> that really juices up the performance and has an extra-spicy video thumbnail aimed squarely at Sony.</p><p>For years, the most rabid of <em>Bloodborne </em>fans have been quick to jump at any <em>Bloodborne</em>-related news as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173905/sony-teases-bloodborne-in-astros-playroom-update-hours-ahead-of-summer-game-fest">a potential clue</a> to an upcoming, long-awaited remake. And in this case, it only takes a short scroll of McDonald’s replies on his post to see people speculating that this takedown means Sony <em>must </em>be nearing some kind of announcement in time for the 10-year anniversary of <em>Bloodborne’s</em> release. Or, perhaps, Sony is just taking a page from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s playbook</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games announced on Friday</a>. The free-to-play brawler’s fifth and final season starts on February 4th and runs through May 30th, 2025, after which you’ll only be able to play against AI opponents or through local co-op. It will also no longer be available to download.</p><p>To gain access to the offline version of <em>MultiVersus</em>, you need to download the latest version of the game and log in during season five. From there, you’ll get a local save file connected to your PlayStation, Microsoft, Steam, or Epic Games account, “allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.​”</p><p>The <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.<em>-</em>like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23279073/multiversus-open-beta-wb-games-smash-bros"><em>MultiVersus</em> first launched in an open beta</a> in 2022, but it went offline in 2023 after its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23603292/multiversus-player-count-base-free-play-wb-games">player count dropped</a>. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24097129/multiversus-release-date-warner-bros-games">relaunched in May 2024</a>, adding characters from across Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property, like Samurai Jack, the Powerpuff Girls, and Beetlejuice. The fifth season will add the game’s final characters: Aquaman and the <em>Looney Tunes</em>’ Lola Bunny.</p><p><em>MultiVersus</em> is also ending in-game purchases starting today, which means you can no longer buy Gleamium. You can still use any remaining Gleamium or character tokens until the end of season five, however.</p><div><p>It’s been a pretty rough past few months for live service games like <em>MultiVersus</em>, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">Sony shut down <em>Concord</em></a> last year and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">canceled two unannounced live service projects</a>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em> servers go offline in June</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
