Fans have been waiting almost a decade for the next entry in Samus’ first-person adventures. Early previews painted an <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">alarming picture of overly chatty sidekicks</a> ruining what’s traditionally a lonely and moody experience. Meanwhile formal reviews <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/02/nx-s1-5627515/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">run</a> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond">a gamut</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-1235475679/">of</a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">opinions</a>, leaving the game in the interesting if tiresome discourse-inducing “7 / 10” range — not perfect, not awful, but possessed of a certain<em> something</em> that makes it uniquely more interesting than many higher scoring games.</p><p>So what exactly is that something? Does <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> even have it and if it does, does it make it worth the eight-year wait? My colleague Andrew Webster (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">who reviewed the game</a>) and I want to answer those questions and more from <em>Verge</em> subscribers right here in the comments. Since the game isn’t out yet, we can’t answer anything too spoilery, particularly as it pertains to the story. But if you wanna know about Samus’ cool new bike, her new friends, new powers, and just what generally makes a <em>Metroid</em> game shine, just ask. We’ll pop on around 1PM ET to answer what we can in the comments.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/836580/metroid-prime-4-ask-me-anything]]></content:encoded>
