            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Momentum is what <em>Wheel World</em> does best. It is the feeling of reaching a downhill section of road, a pristine Sega-blue sea stretching out in the far distance, and letting gravity, the weight of your bicycle, and slope do all the work. Release the right trigger, the button used to peddle, and simply careen down the gently curving asphalt. It’s as if you’re flying — the wind in your hair and shirt fluttering on your back, coasting to wherever the road takes you.</p><p><em>Wheel World</em> is an undeniably feel-good video game. But this wasn’t always the case. It started life with the title “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html">Ghost Bike</a>,” casting you as a deceased cyclist making their way to bicycle Valhalla. One name change later (and probably a lot of behind-the-scenes wrangling), it arrives as a game about the unmitigated joy of riding a bicycle through a Mediterranean island.</p><p>The roads here are lined with cypress trees, the beaches are white and sandy, and you’ll come across many chic cyclists lounging in cafes. The atmosphere is so vividly rendered that I can practically taste the vacation Coca-Cola as I play. Summer itself seems strewn across the screen.</p><p>You play as Kat, a rider chosen by a cycling spirit named Skully to enact an ancient ritual. This is achieved by accruing parts of a so-called legendary bicycle: frame, wheels, chain, and more, which have fallen into the hands of rival cycling gangs. So you race these teams (which have superbly off-beat names like the “Nude Dudes” and “Shimmy Squad”), moving across a mix of dirt and road tracks. You encounter other cycling spirits residing in gigantic sculpted bike bells along the way. Ringing your bell at one of them causes the stonework to crack, thus revealing said spirit. You chat and gain an extra few bars on your boost gauge, before a portion of the map is revealed with tiny little icons indicating where you should pootle to next.</p><p>That’s right: <em>Wheel World</em>, from California-based studio Messhof, maker of the excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4547420/nidhogg-indie-fencing-game-coming-out-this-year"><em>Nidhogg</em></a> sword-dueling games, is structured like an open-world behemoth from Ubisoft. But expectations should be kept in check. There isn’t a blockbuster’s worth of content here. Rather, across the roughly seven hours of playtime, you’ll take part in races, duke it out with lone cyclists, and meet cute little dudes with boxes on their heads who point you in the direction of new gear. Oh, and there are strange hovering drones which dole out rewards for classic checklist completion stuff (like finding hidden jumps and lost members of cycling crews).</p><p>You could argue the game is a little slight in its array of things to do. But that’s not quite right. Rather, <em>Wheel World</em> requires you to rethink traditional definitions of content — to move beyond markers on a map. Content, for example, is every highway and path whose varying terrains cause your bicycle to handle differently. It is the shaky, unstable feeling that is channeled from screen to hand to brain via the controller when you veer onto the little slip of gravel next to the road. Content is also watching Kat as she strains to surmount a hill with a gradient that would cause a heart attack in most. Our hero remains stoic: I marvel at her thighs of steel!</p><p><em>Wheel World </em>is filled with many more beautifully animated details. You’re able to hop off your bicycle and push it around on foot. Maneuvering in a tight space, Kat does a kind of swivel trick with her handlebars, essentially spinning the bike frame around in one effortless motion. Another deftly rendered moment: when Kat dismounts, lifting her right leg over the bike, resting it next to her left, and then freewheeling to a gentle stop while standing upright. If you’re a cyclist, this move will likely already be familiar to you: it means every journey ends with nonchalant cool (or so you likely imagine). I’ve never seen it reproduced in a video game before.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p>All this serves to make ambling around the island an exquisitely elegant thing. It’s a shame, then, that the racing is a little more chaotic, a little less refined. Showdowns on wide open roads are, for the most part, a joy. Those that take place in tight city streets can be finicky, Kat bouncing awkwardly off AI cyclists, world geometry, and oncoming traffic. The difficulty also feels a touch wonky: races are too easy for much of the game before an unexpected spike arrives in the last hour or so (exacerbated by a chugging frame rate on the PlayStation 5).</p><p>Still, these moments of frustration only made me pine all the more for the relative serenity of the open (world) road. Upon rolling credits, I dived back in to check off remaining objectives while soaking up the picture-postcard vibe again. This, I think, is the true mark of a game like <em>Wheel World</em>: the extent to which the core mechanics might cajole you back.</p><p>Galavanting during my post-credits session, I thought about another notable racing title with light open-world design: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. The latest in Nintendo’s flagship kart racer is a cascading stream of serotonin hits induced by cotton-candy skies, soaring backflips, and delightful <em>wahoos</em>. It is a pure pleasure machine. <em>Wheel World</em>, on the other hand, doles out joy with a little less machine-like efficiency. It is more languid, massaging your eyeballs, ears, and brain with great blocks of warm, cel-shaded color, nostalgia-tinted electropop, and, of course, beautifully tactile cycling.</p><p>What mileage there is in simply ebbing and flowing across the gorgeous sun-kissed land, carried along by both cool breeze and smooth tarmac. Freewheeling, it is practically impossible not to break out in a smile. With every descent, those smiles only widen.</p><p><sub>Wheel World <em>launches July 23rd on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/711680/wheel-world-review-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

The game was originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682512/the-outer-worlds-2-will-start-at-79-99">supposed to debut at $79.99</a> in October, but it’s now going back to the regular $69.99 Xbox game price.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">announced earlier this year</a> that it would be raising the price of new Xbox first-party games from $69.99 to $79.99, alongside increases to its consoles and controllers. The move to suddenly drop the price of <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is a clear sign that preorders haven’t gone too well and that gamers are rejecting Microsoft’s initial move to $79.99 Xbox games.</p><p>If you’ve already purchased the game then refunds will be handled by the Microsoft Store, Steam, PlayStation store or wherever you preordered <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>.</p><p>Other first-party Xbox games coming this holiday will also be sold at $69.99, instead of Microsoft’s new $79.99 pricing. “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions,” says an unnamed Xbox spokesperson in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>It will be interesting to see whether Microsoft continues to push its new Xbox game pricing in the new year, or whether this is a sign that it’s fully rethinking the increase to $79.99.</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 23rd</strong>: Article updated with Xbox statement.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox]]></content:encoded>
