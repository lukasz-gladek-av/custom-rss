            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/681172/gustavo-santaolalla-interview-the-last-of-us-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When fans nervously tuned in to watch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">HBO’s adaptation of one of their favorite video games</a>, there was one familiar presence that immediately calmed their nerves: the mournful guitar of Gustavo Santaolalla. As certain story beats changed and beloved polygonal faces were replaced with new actors, the beating heart of <em>The Last of Us</em> — its mesmerizing, tension-ridden score — survived the transition to TV intact.</p><p>“[Series creator] Neil Druckmann has said that my music is part of the DNA of <em>The Last of Us</em>,“ Santaolalla says. “I think the fact that we kept the sonic fabric — that we didn’t do an orchestral score for the series — has been instrumental in keeping those fans of the games fans of the series, too.”</p><p>Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Santaolalla first started releasing music when he was 17. Loving both English rock bands and the traditional Argentine folk music that he was raised on, Santaolalla melded both into his own unique sound, part of a genre called rock nacional. Before he could fully make his mark, Santaolalla’s family fled the Argentine junta dictatorship in 1978, moving to Los Angeles, where his unique sound soon caught the attention of filmmakers. Snapped up to score the 2000 film <em>Amores Perros</em> and 2003’s <em>21 Grams, </em>their success led to Santaolalla composing the soundtracks for <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> and <em>Babe</em>l, both of which won him Oscars.</p><p>Santaolla’s sonic secret? Embracing the eloquence of silence. “I work so much with silence and space, because silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing,” says Santaolalla. “I remember on <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> when I first sent them the music, the producer said ‘I thought you were pulling my leg at first, because you wait so long to play the next note!’”</p><div><p>“Silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing.”</p></div><p>After winning two Oscars back to back, Santaolalla carefully considered his next career move. Despite being a self-professed “terrible gamer” Santaolalla tells me he always loved watching his son play, mesmerized by the on-screen kineticism. “I always thought that if somebody connects this at an emotional level with a player, it’s going to be a revolution.”</p><p>It turns out, the universe had picked up on Santaolalla’s newest interest. Post-Oscars, he was approached by several game companies to do music, but turned them down because “I’m very picky about the work that I do.” That includes a lucrative gaming project that he is careful not to name. “Everyone thought I was crazy!” he chuckles. Still, Santaolalla quietly hoped that a more emotionally-resonant project would materialize.</p><p>“So, I waited… and then Neil appeared,” Santaolalla says. “When Neil told his colleagues that he wanted me to do this, [his colleagues ] said, No, Gustavo is not going to be interested — he won two Oscars! But when Neil [told me] the story, and that he wanted to do a game that connects with people on an emotional level… I was sold.</p><p>What even Neil Druckmann wasn’t prepared for, however, was that Gustavo’s music would become just as crucial a presence as Ellie and Joel. In a post apocalyptic world where life is scarce and danger lurks around every corner, silence hangs in the air like a threat. Santaolalla’s scuffed notes, discordant melodies and screeching fret slides reverberate across the dilapidated city streets, feeling as unpredictable as the world Ellie and Joel inhabit.</p><div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes.”</p></div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes,” Santaolalla explains. “Any professional guitar player when they’re recording tend to avoid all kinds of noises; when you run your hand on the fretboard or little glitches in your playing. But sometimes, I’ll push those in my mix, and I think that humanizes it. That’s why many people have said that my music becomes like a character — a presence. It’s why I play things myself.”</p><div><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">the second game</a>, Gustavo’s music becomes a physical part of the fiction, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281499/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-guitar-touchpad">Ellie carrying a guitar throughout her quest for vengeance</a>. She takes out the instrument during welcome moments of downtime, offering cathartic respite. And just like Gustavo’s score, these beautiful vignettes break up the harrowing silence, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">which carries through in the second season of the show</a>.</p></div><p>“I love the TV series too,” says Santaolalla. “ For the show, Neil associated himself with another incredible talent, Craig Mazin — the guy that did <em>Chernobyl</em> — who knows that media and that language. I think it was a big, big challenge, because when you go from one media to another one, people say no, I like the original better! So, I think, once again, that the way we have used the music has been instrumental to keep that fan base attached.”</p><p>He adds that “I think that when a story is really great, like a theatrical piece — like Shakespeare — it doesn’t matter who plays the character. Obviously Pedro Pascal’s Joel is different than the Joel from the game, but the substance of the character is so powerful that those things are just superficial. They could have done this as a series, as a feature film, as a puppet theatre piece, or an animation and it will still land regardless — because it’s just great writing.”</p><p>Now as Santaolalla finds himself releasing his very own instrument — the Guitarocko — it feels like the culmination of the musical journey he started as a teen. Melding the traditional Bolivian 10 stringed ronroco with the form factor of a Fender Stratocaster, Gustavo feels a father-like pride for his musical creation: the 73-year-old is invigorated by what <em>The Last Of Us</em> has given him at this stage in his career.</p><p>“I’ve been blessed with the fact that I have connected with an audience since I was very young,” he says. “But the way I connect with the fans of <em>The Last of Us</em> and the way they connect with the music… here’s a special devotion that is really beautiful. I have this new audience which is fantastic, and I love that they didn’t know me as an artist or as a film composer! Now they look for my music, and they discover these things. It’s been a gift for me, at this point — after everything that I’ve been through — to be involved with a project like this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674953/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I usually struggle with strategy games. They’re typically too hard for me, and I often get overwhelmed at managing multiple characters or squads. But I couldn’t put down <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, which blends ideas from strategy games <em>and</em> classic <em>TMNT</em> arcade games to keep things snappy, easy to play, and full of action.</p><p>One way <em>Tactical Takedown </em>— developed by <em>I Am Your Beast</em> maker Strange Scaffold — keeps things simple is by having you play as just one character in each of the game’s 20 levels. The four turtles have different movesets; Leonardo, for example, uses his swords to aggressively attack enemies, while Michelangelo can zip around the playing field on his skateboard. You’re able to customize each turtle’s arsenal by buying new moves, but I didn’t change the movesets at all and got through the game just fine.</p><p>Battles take place in a grid overlaid on small chunks of very <em>TMNT</em> locations, like a street, sewer, or subway system. Every turn, you have six “action points” to spend as you please, whether that’s moving around the level or attacking bad guys. You just press a button to use one of your moves, no menu required, which speeds things up considerably. You have six hearts and three “lives” — lose a life and the game will quickly flash a “Continue” sign before letting you choose where you’d like to drop in the level to keep the fight going. (You also lose a score multiplier.)</p><p>The levels feel like tiny dioramas, and while characters will move into a kick or a punch when attacking or a fall when taking damage, they aren’t actively animated moment to moment. It all creates the sense that you’re playing with action figures.</p><p>Perhaps <em>Tactical Takedown</em>’s best trick is that the levels are constantly shifting around you. Every once in a while, the game will show you that a new piece of land is going to drop in on the next turn, and after that spot is in place, you’ll get a warning that another part of the level is going to fall away. It means that you’re constantly dealing with new terrain, layouts, and hazards like poisonous sewage or cars driving by while also strategizing on how to fight bad guys. Sometimes, after adding a new chunk of a level, the game even flashes the word “Go,” encouraging you to move forward like you would in an arcade game.</p><p>Even better, if there isn’t a wall, you can send enemies flying off the edge of a level into the void, defeating them instantly. It took me a bit to understand that the game <em>wants</em> you to do that as much as possible; occasionally, there will be a lot of bad guys in a level, and the only way to efficiently take them out is by sending them to their doom.</p><p>For me, it all came together in a level where you play as Leonardo in a subway tunnel. The level started on a subway platform, and then the game signaled that a subway car would appear. I navigated my way onto the subway car, and the platform fell away. After a few turns on the subway car, it “arrived” at the next subway stop, and I had to hop off. It really felt like I was “advancing” through a level in a faster-paced game, and all while managing a legion of enemies with Leonardo’s swords. </p><p>The genre is usually slow, but when you get in a good rhythm, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> almost feels as crisp as the <em>TMNT</em> arcade games — despite being a turn-based strategy game.</p><p><sub>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown<em> is now available on PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
