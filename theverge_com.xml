            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/brandon-russell">Brandon Russell</a> <span>is a commerce writer covering deals and buying guides. Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today is <strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></strong> launch day, and what better way to celebrate than with a discount? The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>-exclusive game is currently $62.99 ($7 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/.product.4000373240.html" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for members. Nintendo games rarely go on sale, even after several months on shelves, so any amount off the retail price is a big win on launch day.</p><p>If you were on the fence about whether to get the game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">let our review assuage any concerns</a>. It rules. <em>The Verge’s</em> Ash Parrish describes it as a “fantastic feast.” The game offers satisfying punching mechanics, creative level design, and the unmistakable polish that most Nintendo games possess. Whereas <em>Mario Kart World</em> was a pretty good launch title, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>’s first must-have game.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Anker Charging Station (7-in-1, 100W)</strong> is a great desk accessory for charging multiple devices, and it’s currently down to $35.99 ($14 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHFF6P5Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is an all-time low price. The charging station offers a maximum output of 100W, allowing you to charge power-hungry devices quickly. There are seven ports in total — three AC outlets on the back, and four USB ports (two USB-C and two USB-A) on the front. In addition, the charging station offers surge protection and a 5-foot built-in cable, giving you flexibility to position it where you want.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>CMF Buds Pro</strong> with active noise cancellation are down to just $29 ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ8R2NNP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, the lowest price we’ve seen. The wireless earbuds feature a stem design similar to AirPods, and offer premium features like transparency mode, an adjustable EQ, and up to 6.5 hours of battery life. With microphones inside and outside the earbuds, the ANC feature can suppress noise of up to 45dB, giving you peace and quiet at the coffee shop.</span></li><li><span><strong>Epic Games</strong> is hosting a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/summer-sale">summer sale through July 31st</a>, offering modest discounts on games like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> for $47.99 ($12 off), <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> for $44.99 ($5 off), and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> for $52.49 ($17 off). One of the most notable perks of the sale is that each purchase lands you an extra 20 percent back in Epic Rewards using Epic’s payment system through August 31st. You can redeem Epic Rewards on future game purchases or add-ons, though Epic says you can’t use the rewards on subscriptions like Fortnite Crew.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/709274/donkey-kong-bananza-costco-sale-deal]]></content:encoded>
