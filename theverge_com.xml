PC makers like Lenovo and HP have been stockpiling memory, but those stockpiles will likely run out in a few months time and lead to increased prices and potentially even PC configuration changes.</p><p>“Beyond the obvious pressure on prices of systems, already announced by certain manufacturers, we might also see PC memory specifications be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” says Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice president at IDC. “The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile.”</p><p>IDC is now expecting average selling prices of PCs to rise in 2026 as PC makers shift priority to midrange and premium systems to offset the higher costs of memory. All of this points to an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/858505/pc-market-ram-nand-ssd-gpu-pricing-notepad">AI-driven storm for the PC market throughout 2026</a>. If you’re thinking about buying a new PC, it might be better to make the purchase sooner rather than later this year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/861124/pc-market-growth-q4-2025-idc]]></content:encoded>
