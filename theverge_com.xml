            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> just received its second major update as part of its early access development, which was a great excuse for me to jump back in. Since its initial release, I’ve logged more than 30 hours and actually held myself back from playing much more – I don’t want to get tired of the game before it hits 1.0 – but with the new update, I wanted to see what’s new and try to beat the new final boss on my very first run.</p><p>Sadly, I haven’t even been able to see what the boss is yet. I <em>did</em> make it to the update’s new region, but I got destroyed by a dangerous miniboss. Still, I’ve still been really impressed with what Supergiant Games has added since May to make what’s already a very good game even better.</p><p>The big additions are impressive. <em>Hades II</em> initially launched with six regions — four for an Underworld route and two for a “surface” route — and with each major update, Supergiant has added a new region with new enemies, characters, and music to round out that surface route.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">first major update</a>, which came out in October, added the game’s first new region, Mount Olympus, and it feels as epic as Mount Olympus should. It has grand architecture, fearsome enemies, and a fiery boss fight against Prometheus, all backed by an incredible orchestral soundtrack. (I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiYUgx74rU">this song on loop</a>.)</p><p>That update also added the game’s sixth and final weapon – a witch-y, <em>Hades</em>-style interpretation of a mech suit. Seriously: your primary attack is punching baddies with giant fists while your special attack shoots projectiles that home in on nearby targets. You also have cool wings.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615857/hades-ii-2-warsong-update">second major update</a>, there’s a new region and boss, too, but I’ve also noticed a lot of smaller details that feel just as impactful. For example, the Altar of Ashes, a place where you pick from various passive effects in the form of arcana cards that can help your runs, got a visual redesign to add intricately-illustrated custom cards. (One of them features Theseus and the Minotaur, who you may remember as bosses from the first <em>Hades</em>, in thongs, lol.) I also spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1itjeu2/this_new_mel_portrait_is_so_adorable/">charming new portrait for Melinoë</a>, the game’s protagonist, that added some levity to a character that’s usually pretty serious.</p><p>And throughout the major updates and many smaller patches, Supergiant has rebalanced and changed all sorts of mechanics and details in ways that I can honestly barely begin to keep track of. The studio isn’t afraid to take the hatchet to things that need to go, too; with this most recent patch, Supergiant scrapped an entire mechanic tied to gathering.</p><p>Overall, the changes have made the game feel better to play over time – and browsing patch notes, Supergiant uses an emoji to indicate which changes are inspired by community feedback, which I think is a good way to acknowledge how players are contributing to the game, which is one of the main benefits of this type of early access release. (I should also acknowledge that <em>Hades II</em> has the advantage of building from the already-great foundation of the first <em>Hades.</em>)</p><p><em>Hades II</em> might not launch in 1.0 for a long time. Supergiant hasn’t committed to a timeframe for that, and it’s still working on a third major update that’s set to release “some months from now.” Because of the success of Supergiant’s other games, like <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>, the studio probably doesn’t need to rush.</p><p>But given how it’s treated <em>Hades II’s</em> early access so far, I’m fine if Supergiant takes its time. Even though <em>Hades II</em> isn’t finished, I have no qualms about recommending the game to anyone that’s interested. And jumping in now lets you experience just how much an already-great game can improve over time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617336/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The fuzz of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, alongside static grains and flickering scanlines, is a touchstone for ’90s-era nostalgia. It’s shorthand for those halcyon days when technology was predominantly analog and millennial kids spent their summers shoving bulky tapes into VHS players, recording favorite bits of their after-school television shows, and making their own home videos with camcorders. It’s this vignette that developer Don’t Nod Montréal leans heavily into in <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. </em>The game follows a blossoming friendship — and apparent falling-out — of four teenagers over an unforgettable summer. And it all starts with a good dose of that nostalgia: the ubiquitously blue anti-drug message that precedes the title screen, complete with the telltale flicker of a CRT monitor.</p><p>Such adolescent longing is all par for the course for Don’t Nod. Alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead">Telltale</a>, the studio popularized the choose-your-own-adventure style of narrative games with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">Life is Strange</a></em>, while foregrounding the outsized pain and tribulations of teenhood. But more than just coating teenage drama in a layer of dreamy nostalgia, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is also an opportunity for Don’t Nod to write a story based in familiar settings. The era already has its own vocabulary and culture; it’s the era of riot grrrl, Bikini Kill, <em>The</em> <em>Blair Witch Project</em>, and video rental stores. Doing so helps <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> avoid the criticism of penning teenage slang and using outdated references that sound like they’re written by much older adults. This means a lot less “hella cool” and more “let’s bounce,” which is <em>definitely </em>a phrase I remember using as a teenager.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> looks like another <em>Life is Strange</em>. Every moment is infused with the same emotional weight the series is known for, be it standing up to a bully or excitedly gushing about your new best friend to your cat. Then there’s the tinge of the supernatural. But while promising, it’s a tad early to see if <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> can surpass the juggernaut that was the original <em>Life is Strange</em>. That’s because <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a two-part adventure game — a nod to the episodic roots of its forebears — with the second half of the game expected to release in mid-April this year.</p><p>Set in the small town of Velvet Cove, you’ll play as Swann, one of the four central teenagers. The story is depicted across two time periods: the present-day Swann as an adult meeting her long-lost friends decades later, and her earlier days as an awkward teenager during the summer of ’95.</p><p>The first few minutes of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> neatly set the stage. At first, the adult Swann is struggling with a tedious, mostly one-sided conversation with her mother over the phone, and she can choose to respond meekly, with indifference, or mere silence. Meanwhile, lots of objects in the vicinity are available for her to fiddle with: a receipt, some brochures, and even a bottle of maple syrup. While examining these will cause Swann’s mother to chide her for being distracted, this also demonstrates how Don’t Nod is expanding the ways in which dialogue can play out. You can look at specific objects and this will, at times, open up new dialogue choices that can influence your current and future conversations with other characters. It’s a small addition, but it helps make conversations feel more authentic, rather than simply choosing between binary choices of playing nice or being rude.</p><p>Flashbacks to Swann’s younger days make up the bulk of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage’</em>s first half, with the teenager navigating the thorny passage of adolescent friendships. In the beginning, Swann is a loner, largely reluctant to socialize and too awkward to belong anywhere — the familiar plight of every millennial teenager. Spending her days memorializing almost every waking moment with a camcorder, Swann will meticulously record clips of anything that catches her eye, before putting them together to make short films. Aside from the conversations, documenting Swann’s everyday life is the game’s central conceit, a bold gamble given how this can feel like busywork at first.</p><p>From fulfilling objectives that move the storyline along, such as filming the local video store (it’s one of Swann’s favorite haunts), to discovering collectibles in the form of crude graffiti and exotic birds, this almost reduces the game to an object-hunting adventure. Eventually, you may develop the tendency to just whip out the camcorder the moment cutscenes conclude. But there’s a lingering charm to this approach, highlighting how Swann tends to instinctively interact with the people around her through her camcorder. Making films is the one thing that empowers her. This is all the more poignant as she eventually comes out of her shell and hides less behind her lens.</p><p>And then there are Swann’s newfound friends — Nora, Autumn, and Kat — who similarly are more than just one-dimensional caricatures. There’s Nora who, for all her bravado and punk rock sensibilities, is one of the most conflict-averse individuals in the group and the quickest to suggest giving up when they get into trouble. Then there are seemingly villainous folks who are more multifaceted than what their initial hostility suggests, which isn’t revealed until you examine their behavior and personal artifacts.</p><p>These point toward complexities that a young Swann may not fully comprehend, evident in some of her childlike responses, but that the older Swann — and by extension, the player — can probably recognize. This is what Don’t Nod has always been adept at: crafting believable and deeply human characters and the abundant world that they inhabit.</p><p>Experiencing the idyllic memories of Swann’s days with her friends can be deeply emotional, as if chancing upon a time capsule you’ve forgotten about. These are long-buried moments about engaging in hours-long phone calls with close friends, partaking in rambunctious activities on the fly, and waxing lyrical about larger-than-life ambitions, like playing in famous bands or living in a secret getaway, hidden from the prying eyes of untrustworthy adults.</p><p>Seeing Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat trade lifelong promises and form intense bonds — ones so characteristic of deep female friendships — will hit close to home for many. It’s this juxtaposition between these idyllic scenes and the constant, foreboding reminder of the group’s inevitable fallout that feels so ominous, unnerving, and perhaps a little painful. And the vague, supernatural happenings only serve to heighten the anxieties of teenhood. Whether it serves a deeper, more metaphorical purpose still remains to be seen. </p><p>The first half of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> ends in a dramatic cliffhanger, of course, but it’s one that’s not quite as audacious as it seems. Some hints have been hiding in plain sight. But a small concern lingers. Stories like these often introduce so many twists that could derail the game, before the story goes off the rails so quickly that it inevitably plummets. This was partly why the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a> faltered in its concluding chapters. For now, there’s plenty of time to wonder; we still have to wait two more months or so for <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s melodramatic conclusion.</p><p><sub>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage <em>is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Lenovo Legion Go S was supposed to change things. It was poised to show Valve isn’t the only one that can build an affordable, portable, potent handheld gaming PC — you just need the right design and the right OS. </p><p>I was intrigued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">when Valve’s own Steam Deck designers told me</a> this Windows handheld would double as the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld this May. When I heard Lenovo had procured an exclusive AMD chip that would help that SteamOS version hit $499, I got excited for a true Steam Deck competitor. </p><p>But I’m afraid that chip ain’t it. </p><p>I’ve spent weeks living with a Legion Go S powered by AMD’s Z2 Go, the same chip slated to appear in that $499 handheld. I’ve used it with both Windows and Bazzite, a SteamOS-like Linux distro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">that eliminates many of Windows’ most annoying quirks</a>. I tested both directly against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a Steam Deck OLED</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a>, expecting to find it between the two in terms of performance and battery life. But that’s not what I found.</p><p>Watt for watt, its Z2 Go chip simply can’t compete with the Steam Deck, and it’s far weaker than the Z1 Extreme in last year’s handhelds. That’s inexcusable at the $730 price you’ll currently pay for the Windows version, and I won’t be the first reviewer to say so. But with this less efficient chip and a mere 55 watt-hour battery, I worry the Legion Go S isn’t a good choice at all.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->730</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li><li>Fast 100W charging</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Performance is too low</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><p>I <em>want</em> to say that the Legion Go S “makes a great first impression,” but Windows 11 still features a terrible out-of-box experience. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates to install and dismissing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196408/dark-patterns-are-everywhere">dark-patterned</a> offers for Microsoft products that have no business being on my handheld gaming machine. </p><p>Still, the Go S is built far better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the original Legion Go</a>, whose flat-faced controllers felt awkward in my hands. The new portable has some of the best-sculpted grips I’ve felt on a handheld, though their smooth texture can feel a little slippery. I’d have gone with more aggressive stippling to help me hold its 1.61-pound weight.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But its buttons all feel precise and secure, if the triggers are longer than I’d like, and its concave-topped, drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks feel comfy and wonderfully smooth to spin. The only weak control is the touchpad, which is so tiny I flick repeatedly to move the cursor an inch at a time.</p><p>Audio is much improved from front-facing speakers, and a larger fan moves more air while staying quieter than before. And it’s one of the fastest-charging handhelds yet — I clocked each of its top-mounted USB 4 ports drawing a full 100 watts of USB-C PD power during actual use. The cooling and charging are so good, Lenovo lets you crank the chip up to 40-watt TDP while it’s plugged in or 33 watts on battery alone.</p><p>But as you’ll see in my benchmark charts, the Z2 Go simply isn’t in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck OLED’s “Sephiroth” chip. In some games, it can’t beat the Steam Deck at all, even if you plug it in and crank it all the way up. </p><div><h2>Legion Go S 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go (Z1 Extreme)</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E vs. Z2 Go</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td>11.36%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>63</td><td>14.55%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>15.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>71</td><td>14.52%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>52</td><td>73</td><td>12.31%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>52</td><td>42</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>31.71%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td><td>59</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>61</td><td>32.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>26.53%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>70</td><td>61</td><td>8.93%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>84</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td><td>89</td><td>34.85%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td><td>91</td><td>35.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>92</td><td>31.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>38.89%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>40.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>34</td><td>33</td><td>37.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td><td>38</td><td>46.15%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td><td>40</td><td>37.93%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>41</td><td>36.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>26</td><td>38</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>61</td><td>50</td><td>-5.66%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>30.19%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>75</td><td>36.36%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td><td>73</td><td>14.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>75</td><td>15.38%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

And that’s <em>after</em> a new set of drivers; the shipping ones were much worse.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>In other games, cranking up Lenovo’s TDP by five, 10, or 15 watts can give it a comfortable lead over the Deck. But that significantly impacts battery. In Lenovo’s default 25W “Performance” mode, I saw some games run just as smoothly as on the Deck — but with total system power consumption of around 36 watts, draining the handheld’s 55 watt-hour battery in about an hour and a half. The Steam Deck, which drains at around 22 to 24 watts at full bore, lasts two hours at the same smoothness.</p><p>I have possible good news about SteamOS: when I installed Bazzite, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck#:~:text=In%20a%20lot%20of%20ways%20Bazzite%20is%20a%20good%20way%20to%20kind%20of%20get%20the%20latest%20and%20greatest%20of%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20been%20working%20on%2C%20and%20test%20it.%E2%80%9D">which can serve as a decent preview</a> of what SteamOS might look and feel like, I saw frame rates improve by an average of 16 percent in early tests (minus <em>Returnal</em>, which seems to hate Linux for some reason), and Bazzite is <em>such</em> a breath of fresh air after attempting to use Windows. But it still didn’t reach Steam Deck performance unless I sacrificed more battery to get it. That works with a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">like the Asus ROG Ally X</a> with a big 80 watt-hour battery, but not so much here.</p><div><h2>Legion Go S Windows vs. Bazzite</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>42</td><td>52</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.27%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>60</td><td>52</td><td>22.45%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>70</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>74</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.46%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>80</td><td>N/A</td><td>21.21%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>25.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>70</td><td>17.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>-29.17%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>22</td><td>N/A</td><td>-15.38%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>-17.24%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>N/A</td><td>-16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>25</td><td>26</td><td>-21.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>51</td><td>61</td><td>-3.77%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>11.32%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>12.73%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>-1.56%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>0.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

In my tests, the original Legion Go with Z1E runs anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent faster comparing Windows to Windows — a lot for a handheld, where modern games struggle to reach smooth frame rates at all. </p><p>The Legion Go S does have an ace up its sleeve: its crisp, colorful 1920 x 1200 IPS screen looks better at lower resolutions than its predecessor’s 2560 x 1600 panel, and it runs more smoothly at lower frame rates now that it has VRR to adjust its refresh rate anywhere between 48Hz and 120Hz on the fly. I would not buy a Legion Go over a Legion Go S for this reason alone. </p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>And if you primarily play games that don’t require performance, the Legion Go S is a bit more efficient at lower wattage: by setting TDP, brightness, and refresh rate low, I was able to achieve a total of just 7.5W battery drain in Windows and 7W in Bazzite while playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">magic math poker game <em>Balatro</em></a>. That should net me seven to eight hours of battery life, and you should be able to hit the four-hour mark without those tricks just by setting the Legion Go S to its 8-watt TDP “Quiet” mode. When I played the similarly easy to run <em>Slay the Spire</em> on the original Legion Go, pulling out all the stops, I couldn’t even reach five hours.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, the Steam Deck does efficiency better. Simply limiting frame rate to 25fps and brightness to 40 percent can yield over eight hours of <em>Balatro </em>on the Deck, and I’ve gotten four hours, 42 minutes in <em>Dave the Diver</em> there. With the Legion Go S, my Dave only got 2.5 hours to hunt those sushi ingredients and blow up fake environmentalists!</p><p>I am comfortable saying <em>no one</em> should buy the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S, which costs $730 at Best Buy. Even if the performance, battery life, and price weren’t disqualifiers, Windows is a stain on this machine. And like other recent Windows handhelds I’ve tested, it does not reliably go to sleep and wake up again: I woke several mornings to find the system hot with fans spinning, even though I’d pressed the power button the previous evening. I found it uncomfortably warm pulling it out of my bag the other day. </p><p>Even if you prefer Windows to SteamOS, you can get notably better performance and far better battery life from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, which is worth every extra penny, particularly since it doubles as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the best Bazzite machine you can buy</a>. </p><p>But even if you add Bazzite to the Legion Go S, it’s no Steam Deck, and I’m not sure that’ll change by May. If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead. </p><div><div><p id="agree-to-continue-legion-go-s"><h2>Agree to Continue: Legion Go S</h2></p></div><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.</em></p><p>To start using the Legion Go S, you’ll need to agree to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Microsoft Software License Terms: Windows Operating System and Terms of Use</span></li><li><span>Lenovo Limited Warranty and “Software license agreements”</span></li></ul></div><p>You can also say “yes” or “no” to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Privacy settings (location, Find My Device, sharing diagnostic data, inking and typing, tailored experience, advertising ID)</span></li></ul></div><p>That’s two mandatory agreements and six optional agreements. Windows also asks you if you want a variety of software and subscription services during the out-of-box experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
