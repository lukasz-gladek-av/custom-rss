It’s priced at $79.99 and will be available on January 30th, with preorders starting on January 7th.</p><p>The Handheld Dock Chroma is a similar concept to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23409757/valve-steam-deck-dock-docking-station-tv-gaming-nintendo-switch">official docking stations provided by Valve</a> or Nintendo, allowing users to hook handheld devices up to external displays with expanded connections to complement big-screen gaming setups. The Handheld Dock Chroma uses a USB-C cable to connect supported devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPads and iPhones with USB-C ports, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch</a>, and Razer’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/15/23392481/razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-tablet-qualcomm-price-release-date-specs">Edge Android gaming handheld</a>. </p><div><div><figcaption><em>Here are the port options in the rear, plus the USB-C cable to connect to your device.

Given the cable placement, certain handhelds like the Switch that have their ports on the underside will need to be positioned upside down in the dock.</p><p>The dock itself is constructed from aluminum and folds down into a box shape to make it easier to transport without damaging it. And given this is a Razer product, there’s naturally a Chroma-enabled RGB bar located at the front, which users can customize with various lighting effects.</p><div><figcaption><em>There’s plenty of ports to hook up things like mice, keyboards, and controllers — providing they use a USB-A connection.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

The feature also makes use of the Kishi Ultra’s Sensa HD support, which converts audio output into haptic feedback on supported Android devices (but sadly isn’t available for iOS). PC Remote Play allows games to be streamed at full resolution without compromising “visual quality or game speed,” according to Razer, and can be accessed via the Razer Nexus app on iOS or Android.</p><div><figcaption><em>Razer’s new PC Remote Play feature provides PC-to-Phone streaming capabilities similar to the Steam Link mobile app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Razer’s prototype gaming chair blasts you with hot or cold air]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/razer%E2%80%99s-prototype-gaming-chair-blasts-you-with-hot-or-cold-air.1075980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s becoming a tradition for Razer to show off some pretty wild prototypes at CES, but the concept gaming chair with integrated heating and cooling it just unveiled actually sounds downright practical. Project Arielle is a mesh gaming chair that features a bladeless fan system that’s designed to keep you at a comfortable temperature regardless of what environment you’re in. </p><p>We briefly tried it here at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news/archives/2">CES 2025</a> and it’s cool! Or warm, depending on the mode you set it to. When my colleague Sean Hollister tried it, he found it didn’t just warm or cool his butt, but gently and quietly blew a substantial amount of climate-controlled air onto his upper back from small holes along the chair’s top edge.</p><div><figcaption><em>A more comfortable way to freeze your butt off.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Building on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883174/razer-fujin-pro-gaming-chair-herman-miller-aeron">$1,049 Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair</a> that you <em>can</em> currently buy, Project Arielle has three adjustable fan speeds that can reduce the perceived temperature by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) in “dry environments,” according to Razer. That sounds pretty useful if you live in a hot climate or if your gaming PC kicks out enough heat to turn your room into a sweatbox. </p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a rendering that shows how the hot or cool air is dispersed from the chair.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><p>For chillier environments, the chair has a built-in PTC heating system (the same kind found in most vehicles and heated car seats) that can spit out warm air at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The fans and that temperatures are adjusted using touch panel controls located next to the seat pad. And given this is a Razer product, there’s obviously RGB lighting throughout the chair. By default, it’s set to Razer’s trademark green when it’s off, and we saw the edge glow red when warm, blue when cool, and purple or orange when cooling or warming. </p><div><figcaption><em>Icons on the touch-controlled panel and the built-in RGB lighting indicate whether the chair is set to blast warm or cold air.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One downside: you can’t spin 360 degrees in this chair without wrapping a cord around yourself, as it does need to be plugged in. But even the prototype already has a cable that’ll safely disconnect if you accidentally give it a yank.</p><div><figcaption><em>The breakaway cable will disconnect if it’s pulled, kinda like the early Xbox controllers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Given Project Arielle is only a concept chair, this unfortunately isn’t something you can actually buy just yet. Razer has showcased a lot of quirky gaming gadget concepts at CES over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">chair cushions that shake your ass</a> with haptic feedback. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
