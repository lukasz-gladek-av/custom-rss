            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now, Google has just over two weeks once again — because the US Supreme Court has decided not to save Google ahead of its Supreme Court appeal. Today, the Court denied the company’s request for a partial stay, meaning the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">permanent injunction is still in effect</a>, meaning Google must do the following things <em>this month</em> or be in violation:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let developers set their own prices</span></li><li><span>Stop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation</span></li><li><span>Work with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores into Google Play</span></li></ul></div><p>Epic Games says the deadline for Google to comply is now October 22nd, 2025. “Starting October 22, developers will be legally entitled to steer US Google Play users to out-of-app payments without fees, scare screens, and friction - same as Apple App Store users in the US!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1975309212336238829">writes Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p><p>Google wouldn’t explicitly tell <em>The Verge</em> if the company now plans to remove the requirement for Google Play Billing, allow other payment methods, and allow developers to link outside the Play Store to app downloads, among other things, at the same time it’s still trying to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.</p><p>But spokesperson Dan Jackson tells <em>The Verge</em> that the company will comply with its legal obligations, and passed along the following statement:</p><p>“Android provides more choice for users and developers than any mobile OS, and the changes ordered by the US District Court will jeopardize users’ ability to safely download apps. While we’re disappointed the order isn’t stayed, we will continue our appeal.”</p><p>Epic did not immediately answer our questions about whether it’s now working with Google on the court-mandated Joint Technical Committee to figure out how to bring Google Play apps to rival app stores without jeopardizing that safety.</p><p>Google has said it will fully appeal to the Supreme Court for certiorari by October 27th, 2025 — but that would be after the deadline. The district court judge who originally issued the injunction, Judge James Donato, previously asked Google and Epic to explain how they’ll comply with it in his courtroom on October 30th.</p><p>It’s still possible that the Supreme Court might take up the case after Google’s deadline has passed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/793610/google-epic-android-supreme-court-stay-denied]]></content:encoded>
