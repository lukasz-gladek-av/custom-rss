Series creative director, Neil Druckmann, announced the premiere of the show’s second season onstage at CES this evening alongside a short teaser for the new season. A specific premiere date wasn’t given.</p><p>The show’s first season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23636850/the-last-of-us-season-1-tlou-hbo-ps5-game-reviews-interviews">wrapped up in March 2023</a>, so it’ll be more than two years between seasons by the time the new one debuts. <em>The Last of Us</em>’ first season was very well-received —&nbsp;particularly for a video game adaptation —&nbsp;so expectations are high for the show’s return.</p><p>This season is supposed to cover a portion of the second game, with the full story being split across two or more seasons, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">an interview last year</a> with the show’s creators. “We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons [2 and 3] because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in Season 1 too,” showrunner Craig Mazin told <em>Deadline</em>.</p><p>Alongside the return of <em>The Last of Us</em>, Sony also announced plans to bring several other PlayStation titles to the screen. <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is being adapted into an anime series, and both <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>and <em>Helldivers 2 </em>are being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show">made into films</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The device, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030930/sony-vr-spatial-smart-control-ring-ces">which Sony first teased at CES last year</a>, will come with 4K OLED displays, video passthrough, and support for third-party design, modeling, and production software.</p><p>Based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBmlGIiAOE&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvoxmedia.stories.usechorus.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE">video shared by Sony</a>, it looks like wearers will be able to flip up the headset when they’re not using it. It doesn’t appear to come with the ring and pointer that Sony showed off last year, though.</p><p>Alongside the headset, Sony revealed Xyn Motion Studio, an accompanying Windows app that supports up to 12 Mocopi sensors, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23780187/sony-mocopi-motion-capture-vr-avatar-us-price-release">wireless motion-tracking system</a> that V-Tubers and other creators often use to control virtual avatars. The software comes with motion-editing features, allowing creators to trim and merge motions, as well as adjust time and position.</p><p>There’s also a prototype of a “spatial capture solution,” which is supposed to transform images of real objects and spaces into “photorealistic” 3D computer-generated assets using Sony’s algorithm. One year out from Sony’s initial teaser, and details are still pretty slim on what exactly this headset will be capable of, aside from viewing and interacting with 3D objects.</p><p>Sony is planning to release its Xyn Motion Studio software in late March 2025, but there still isn’t any word on the availability or pricing of its headset.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Below are some of the standout gadgets of the show so far. Of course, there’s still a lot more out there and a lot more to go.

It’s limited to smaller items like socks, tissues, or anything weighing less than 300 grams, but the company plans to eventually expand what it can grasp. Pricing isn’t known, but Roborock says the Saros Z70 will be available by June 2025.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">Samsung The Frame Pro TV</a></h3></p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Samsung’s The Frame TV appealed to many consumers with an aesthetically pleasing design and the ability to camouflage itself as a piece of art in a home’s decor. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">The Frame Pro further expands the TV’s appeal</a> to more discerning TV viewers with a variation on Mini LED display technology, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009799/samsung-the-frame-2022-preview-matte-display-artwork">matte finish introduced in 2022</a>, and a wireless connection to its breakout box so all you need to hide is a power cord.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday smart glasses</a></h3></p><p>With the success of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>, it’s no surprise that several companies are debuting smart glasses at CES 2025. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday’s new enhanced specs</a>, which are expected to ship “by the end of Q1 2025” and cost between $399 and $499, are differentiated with the addition of a small screen on the frame. The “DigiWindow” appears as a 3.5-inch private display in the upper-right corner of your vision and is controlled using voice commands, an interface on the frame, or a smart ring with an integrated trackpad.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334913/dell-32-plus-monitor-head-tracking-beamforming-audio-ces-2025">Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED monitor</a></h3></p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

The feature eliminates the need to keep your head positioned in a sweet spot for optimal sound, and it could be ideal for gamers who are constantly moving around in the heat of battle. The monitor also features a 120Hz refresh rate, a 0.03ms response time, and will launch in the US on May 22nd, 2025, for $799.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337124/bird-buddy-wonder-petal-camera-track-plants-insects-ces-2025">Wonder plant and insect camera</a></h3></p><p>Bird Buddy is moving on to smaller flying creatures of the outdoors.

You’ll be able to view a livestream from your phone, while an optional solar panel can keep the 4K camera running. It’s supposed to launch on Kickstarter this spring.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">Mirumi</a></h3></p><p>Mirumi is a robot that you might actually want to own. It’s a furry, bashful companion bot that clings to a bag and looks adorable. It doesn’t have AI tricks and doesn’t even make noise.

The answer might be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price">Acer’s new Nitro Blaze 11 featuring a beefy 10.95-inch 144 Hz WQXGA touch display</a> that makes it look like you’re holding a small monitor instead of a portable console. It’s powered by an&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 8040HS processor, 16GB of RAM, and has detachable controllers with Hall effect joysticks. It’s also got a built-in kickstand so you don’t have to strain your arms by always playing it handheld. It will be available starting in Q2 2025 and start at $1,099.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24335612/belkin-stage-powergrip-battery-pack-camera-grip-stand">Belkin Stage PowerGrip</a></h3></p><p>Your smartphone may take great pictures, but it lacks the refined ergonomics of a traditional camera. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24335612/belkin-stage-powergrip-battery-pack-camera-grip-stand">Belkin’s new Stage PowerGrip</a> addresses that issue and battery anxiety. It’s a MagSafe power bank with a 10,000mAh battery, a retractable USB-C cable, and a design that adds a camera-like grip to the iPhone. It’s even got a physical shutter button that works with the iOS camera app over Bluetooth and a small LCD screen on the front showing the battery’s remaining charge. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the PowerGrip will come in several color options.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The designation doesn’t impose sanctions or a ban, but it could make it more difficult for the companies to do business in the US.</p><div><p>Along with owning the popular messaging app WeChat, Tencent is a major name in the gaming industry, as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent">owns <em>League of Legends</em> developer Riot Games</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/">has invested in many others</a>, including Epic Games, Larian Studios, Ubisoft, and FromSoftware.
