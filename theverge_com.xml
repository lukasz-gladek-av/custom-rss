            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317950/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-trailer-premiere-date-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’ve known for some time that the second season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23891310/netflix-castlevania-nocturne-review-konami-animated"><em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em></a> was scheduled to hit Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246189/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-teaser-january-premiere">some time in the new year</a>, but we finally have a solid release date and a bloody new trailer to boot.</p><p>Though the sun is shining bright in <em>Nocturne</em>’s new trailer, the fact that vampire god queen Erzsebet Báthory (Franka Potente) is still out there plotting has Annette (Thuso Mbedu) convinced that all hope is lost. Annette’s feelings seem reasonable considering how Erzsebet’s right hand woman Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson) is back in action despite appearing to be killed by Alucard (James Callis) in <em>Nocturne</em>’s first season. But with Alucard now working with Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel), Richter’s grandfather Juste (Iain Glen), and a hardened Maria Renard (Pixie Davies), the vampires won’t exactly have an easy time plunging the world into darkness.</p><p>The trailer features a handful of shots — Maria is <em>finally </em>going to summon <a href="https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon">her dragon</a> — that make <em>Nocturne</em>’s second season look like it’s trying to top the first in terms of utterly batshit action. And while the trailer doesn’t exactly spell out just what Erzsebet’s up to this time around, we won’t have to wait long to find out for ourselves because <em>Castlevania: Nocturne </em>is set to return on January 16th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
