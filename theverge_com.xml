The developer <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656">has announced</a> that its <em>Pokémon</em>-like hit <em>Palworld</em> is getting a big update in December, which will add a new island to the game. It’s described as the “largest, harshest, and most mysterious” location in the game, measuring around six times the size of Sakurajima, an island that was added in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24174043/palworld-is-getting-a-new-island-and-a-whole-lot-more">a summer update</a>.</p><div><p>Aside from the new location, there aren’t many other details about the forthcoming update.

In September, Nintendo, along with The Pokémon Company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, which alleged that <em>Palworld</em> “infringes multiple patent rights.” This caused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253687/palworld-ps5-japan-release-date-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit">the PS5 port of <em>Palworld</em> to be indefinitely delayed in Japan</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">earlier this month Pocketpair outlined the specific patents</a> at the center of the lawsuit, which appear to cover <em>Pokémon</em>-like actions like tossing a ball at characters in a field.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24307906/craft-3-notes-tasks-calendar-app-mac-iphone-windows"><h2>Craft 3 is shockingly close to my ideal productivity app</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24303161/amazon-influencers-lawsuit-copyright-clean-aesthetic-girl-sydney-nicole-gifford-alyssa-sheil"><h2>Bad influence</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307713/steam-deck-lcd-512gb-deal-autumn-sale"><h2>The discontinued Steam Deck LCD is on sale</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308133/casio-g-shock-dw5000r-digital-watch-announcement"><h2>Casio turns back time with the G-Shock that started it all</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24306534/black-friday-2024-streaming-best-deals-max-hulu-peacock-paramount-plus-cyber-monday"><h2>Max, Hulu, and Paramount Plus are all heavily discounted for Black Friday</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
