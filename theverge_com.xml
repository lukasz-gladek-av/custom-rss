Now, Microsoft appears to be teasing that the next-gen Xbox will be some type of hybrid console and PC.</p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond sat down with <em>Mashable </em>this week to discuss the latest Xbox Ally X handheld, and dropped some vague hints about Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console. When asked about rumors that the next-gen Xbox console will be more like a gaming PC, Bond appeared to agree. “I can tell you you’re right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Bond. “You’re starting to see some of the thinking we have in this handheld, but I don’t want to give it all away.”</p><p>I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>, and that the Xbox Ally devices are an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">early look</a> at what’s to come. Bond’s latest comments are subtle, but they once again line up with her previous promise of delivering an “Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device,” and prioritizing Windows. “That’s why we’re working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming,” said Bond in June, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">announcing a multi-year partnership</a> with AMD for a portfolio of Xbox devices.</p><p>I’m convinced that Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console will be powered by Windows and be part of a number of devices from third parties that Microsoft also considers Xbox consoles. A $1,000 Xbox Ally X handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">tests the appetite</a> for pricey next-gen consoles, and it may well also test the appetite for a combination of Xbox and Windows. Perhaps that’s what Bond means when she says the next-gen Xbox will deliver “the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc]]></content:encoded>

It’s now available from <a href="https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/xbox-360-console-ornament-with-light-and-sound-5QXI8292.html">Hallmark’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hallmark-Keepsake-Christmas-Ornament-Console/dp/B0DR39V41B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for $28.99</a> and pressing its power button <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIuNrejw4EA">plays the console’s swooshy startup sound</a> and then about 20 seconds of the <em>Behold a Pale Horse</em> track from the <em>Halo 3</em> soundtrack that incorporates elements of the <em>Halo</em> theme, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-360-hallmark-keepsake-ornament-is-available-now-and-looks-awesome">according to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>The 3.25-inch tall replica of Microsoft’s nearly 20-year-old console (the 360 launched in November 2005) is surprisingly detailed for something that’s going to get lost amongst a sea of ornaments on your tree, and includes a matching mini controller permanently leaning up against the console’s base.</p><p>It’s powered by a trio of replaceable button batteries should you get overly nostalgic and hit the button ad nauseam. The Xbox 360’s power button even lights up green when pressed, and although green and red is often considered the official colors of the holiday season, it doesn’t appear as if you can create the 360’s Red Ring of Death, despite Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318401/microsoft-has-created-an-xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-ugly-sweater">not shying away from making other merchandise</a> featuring the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832667/microsoft-xbox-red-ring-of-death-poster-power-on-docuseries">infamous error message</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/803728/hallmark-keepsake-ornament-microsoft-xbox-360-console-halo-3-theme]]></content:encoded>
