But thanks to Black Friday, you can pick up a copy on the PlayStation 5 for just $52.99 ($17 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FJHS8TH5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The price has also dropped at Best Buy to $59.99 ($10 off) for <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbattlefield-6-standard-edition-playstation-5%2FJ7CYFSSSPW%2Fsku%2F6642408" rel="sponsored">PS5</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbattlefield-6-standard-edition-xbox-series-x%2FJ7CYF9YZ4F" rel="sponsored">Xbox Series X</a>, giving you more ways to shop.</p><p>With a lot on the line for EA, <em>Battlefield 6</em> is off to a pretty good start, becoming the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">best-selling title</a> in the franchise’s history. Considering how fiercely competitive the online shooter space is, that’s good news after 2021’s <em>Battlefield 2042</em> failed to meet expectations. While reactions to <em>Battlefield 6’s</em> single-player campaign have been lukewarm, the multiplayer component is the real draw. One of the biggest focuses this year is on environmental destruction, which adds to the chaos of large-scale battles.</p><p>Beyond <em>Battlefield 6</em> proper, EA has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807720/ea-battlefield-6-battle-royale-redsec">launched <em>Battlefield Redsec</em></a><em>,</em> a separate free-to-play battle royale mode, which takes place on a huge map called Fort Lyndon. In addition, EA has sketched out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">ambitious plans</a> for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, Season 1, which includes additional content like a new map, a new 4v4 multiplayer mode, and a new vehicle, among other updates. EA says it is also launching a Winter Offensive update on December 9th, which will include special seasonal themed content.</p><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/830040/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>
