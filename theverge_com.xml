            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647481/haste-broken-worlds-game-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> takes the relaxing loop of sliding down and leaping off hills from iOS classic <em>Tiny Wings</em> and turns it into a thrilling, high-speed, and 3D roguelike.</p><p>In <em>Haste</em>, you play as Zoe, a girl who typically delivers letters but has found herself mysteriously transported to the new worlds you run through. When I say run, I mean it: Zoe <em>cannons</em> through the game.</p><p>Levels are filled with rolling hills, and your goal is to leap off the upslopes and land on the downslopes. The better your landings, the more you’ll increase your speed and build a boost meter that can be used for things like a burst forward or a grappling hook.</p><p>You’re incentivized to keep your speed up. The faster you complete a level, the higher grade you’ll get; higher grades give you better bonuses of things like “sparks,” which you can use to buy items.</p><p>Throughout the vibrant, procedurally generated levels, you’ll also have to avoid obstacles like rocks, giant <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc">Sarlacc-like pits</a>, and machines that shoot lasers and bullets at you. If you crash into an object, you’ll lose health and slow down. If you’re too slow, a crackling, damaging energy will sneak up behind you. If you run out of health, you’ll lose a life. Lose all your lives, and your run will end. </p><p>There are some familiar roguelike mechanics in <em>Haste</em>, like a currency you can spend between runs to permanently improve things like your health and boost meters. During runs, you’ll also pick each stage on a map. <em>Haste</em> has a great map feature that lets you pick some or all of your route in advance so that you can play a series of levels without interruption. It really helps with the momentum.</p><p>When things are going well, it’s easy to reach an amazing flow state where you’re leaping from hills at breakneck speed, timing your landings and boosts, dodging obstacles in your path, and racing to the end of every level as fast as you can.</p><p>But at the end of each zone (technically a “shard”), there’s a large boss — like a giant flying snake — and they were often total buzzkills. The boss levels force you to run through more open-ended zones instead of just blasting forward, and the game just isn’t as fun and feels tougher in the open environments. Thankfully, you can change the game’s difficulty level.</p><p>The game’s storytelling messes up the flow, too. You’ll meet a bunch of characters, and while their personalities are fun and their character portraits are illustrated well, they often show up in lengthy, forced conversations between levels. For a game called <em>Haste</em>, there are a lot of long chats!</p><p>Those quibbles only detracted a little from how much I enjoyed <em>Haste</em>. At its best, <em>Haste</em> keeps you on the edge of your seat as you leap up and down from hills and careen through worlds. But when the game changes pace, it can be frustrating. I just want to go fast. </p><p><sub>Haste: Broken Worlds</sub><em><sub> is now available on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/651376/lucas-pope-papers-please-gdc-2025-pioneer-award<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lucas Pope, the solo creator of games like <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, received the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250219539980/en/2025-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Honors-Iconic-WriterDirector-Sam-Lake-With-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-and-Innovative-Designer-Lucas-Pope-With-Pioneer-Award">Pioneer Award</a> from the annual Game Developers Choice Awards this year. It’s a major achievement that puts him in a league with industry giants like Gabe Newell, Yu Suzuki, and Roberta Williams.</p><p>“Now that I’m an official pioneer, I have some requests,” he said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kEXe913VjSs?feature=shared&amp;t=10801">brief acceptance speech</a>. “World peace, obviously. But for this crowd, I’d be happy if you kept making the kinds of unique off-beat, experimental, creative, and especially personal games that I love.”</p><p>It was similar to something Pope had said to me earlier — especially the personal part. I had asked him what advice he might have for developers just starting out. “Make something personal, make it small, release on [Itch.io]. Try to find the people who like the same things you do and then make the things you enjoy.”</p><div><p>“I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.”</p></div><p>Games, for him, have always been about “making something that I want to play,” Pope said. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329676/papers-please-a-game-about-an-immigration-inspector"><em>Papers, Please</em></a>, where you have to make tough decisions while working as an immigration inspector in a fictional country, “it was, ‘I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.’ Nobody else really likes that, was my thinking. And then I made it and I found out, actually, lots of people like the same things I do.”</p><p>That experience gave him the confidence to follow a similar path for his next game. “I’m just going to try that again. I’m going to make a game that doesn’t exist, that I wish I had and that I could play, and I’ll make that. And just based on faith, I’m going to hope that other people also like it,” he said. “If there’s something that you’re passionate about, then make a game about it.”</p><p>That game turned out to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993710/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-lucas-pope-pc-mac"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>, where you’re an insurance inspector investigating deaths and mysteries on the namesake ship. Pope’s latest title is <a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a game for the Playdate about screening aliens at a fictional Martian support center.</p><p>It’s much sillier than <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>; one scenario in <em>Mars</em> asks you to only admit aliens that fart. In <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/261758/mars-after-midnight">a blog post</a> about the game, Pope described it as “something my kids might like,” and he told me that while the kids know about <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>, they’re too young to play them because they’re M-rated. “That’s kind of why I wanted to make <em>Mars</em>. I wanted a game where they could just full-on play it and enjoy it.”</p><p>Pope said they played <em>Mars</em> “dozens of times” and offered suggestions for some of the sessions in the game. As kids, they don’t have a lot of preconceived notions, he said, so while some of their ideas might have been “a little ridiculous,” he could see “the core of a really cool thing that I could munge it a little bit and get it in there.” He added, “I think about games a certain way, but the kids have no framing like that. So having kids does help me see how they play games.”</p><p>As for what Pope wants to explore next? “When I could reflect on <em>Obra Dinn</em> and <em>Papers, Please</em>, I kind of realized [that] maybe I should be going back to 2D,” he said, noting that <em>Mars</em> is “more or less” a 2D game, too. From a production and creativity standpoint, “it’s nice to work in 2D,” he said. “But as far as actual topics and mechanics and things like that, I’m working on a few things. Nothing that is ready for announcement, unfortunately.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game’s title was revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648151/star-wars-zero-company-strategy-game-celebration">earlier this week</a>.</p><p>Alongside the release year, the two companies also shared a bit more information about what you can expect from the game. “In <em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, players will step into the shoes of Hawks, a former Republic officer, to command an elite squad of cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars,” according to a press release.</p><p>You’ll be able to customize Hawks’ appearance and class, and team members you recruit can “be personalized from a range of original <em>Star Wars</em> character classes and species.” Your team members can also “forge bonds” to “unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle.”</p><p><em>Zero Company</em> will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S.</p><p>Bit Reactor is leading development on <em>Zero Company</em> alongside Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games. The game was initially announced without a title in January 2022 as part of a three-game set of <em>Star Wars</em> titles that Respawn would be working on. The other two games are <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a></em> and a new FPS game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
