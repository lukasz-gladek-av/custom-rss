To compensate, the company says it’s considering options including moving manufacturing to the US and increasing prices for consumers.</p><p>Speaking to investors during the company’s earnings call, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed that the company is considering “passing on” the price of tariffs to consumers in order to mitigate the impact on its bottom line. Tao didn’t mention the PS5 by name though, and it’s possible that Sony could try to protect pricing on its console through increases elsewhere in its electronics business. Sony has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand">increased the price of the PS5</a> this year, but only in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p>The PS5 did get a call out from CEO Hiroki Totoki when discussing the possibility of moving manufacturing to the US to avoid the brunt of Donald Trump’s tariffs. He admitted that the console “can be produced locally,” and that it would be “an efficient strategy” that “has to be considered going forward.”</p><p>Over the 12 months ending in March, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_supplement.pdf">Sony shipped</a> 18.5 million PS5 consoles — down slightly from 20.8 million the year before — bringing its lifetime shipments to 77.7 million.</p><div><p>Sony still <a href="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1913219268600373503">manufactures the majority of its PS5 hardware in China</a>, and so its gaming business is especially at risk right now. Even after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664811/us-china-pause-tariffs-90-days">90-day pause and reduction in rates</a> announced this week, the 30 percent tariff on imports into the US from China is substantially higher than the 10 percent rate levied on other countries, and games consoles were not included in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647811/smartphone-laptop-chips-tariffs-returning-semiconductor-sector-tariffs">exemptions for select other electronics</a>. Microsoft has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">raised the price of its Xbox consoles by up to $100</a>, though Nintendo has so far elected to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">keep Switch 2 pricing the same</a> ahead of its launch next month.</p></div><div><p>We may learn more about Sony’s pricing plans going forward when it announces the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666305/sony-xm6-headphone-launch">flagship WH-1000XM6 headphones</a> tomorrow, which succeed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">$399 XM5s</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The title was included in a press release about upcoming movies, but apparently by mistake, since it was removed shortly after publication.</p><p>The title first appeared in a <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/nbcuniversal-presents-2025-upfront-content-slate-">press release about NBCUniversal’s upcoming content slate</a>, listed as part of a selection of films scheduled to stream exclusively on NBC’s Peacock following their theatrical release. Within hours the post had been updated and “<em>Super Mario World</em>” removed, along with mentions of <em>Shrek</em> and <em>Minions</em> movies.</p><p>The title makes some sense. The first film’s post-credit scene teased the arrival of Mario’s bright green dinosaur steed / friend Yoshi, who made his videogame debut in… <em>Super Mario World</em>, which launched on the SNES in 1990. It was the console’s most popular game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200908004707/http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/09/30-best-selling-super-mario-games-of-all-time-on-the-plumbers-30th-birthday/">selling more than 20 million copies</a>.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>NBCUniversal’s announcement as it initially appeared.</em></figcaption> <cite>Screenshot: NBCUniversal</cite></span></p></section><p>The upcoming sequel to <em>The Super Mario Bros.

A sequel came as no big surprise after the first film brought in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">over $1 billion worldwide</a>. Nintendo took that as a green light to ramp up its entertainment efforts, with a live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie also in the works and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">due to release in March 2027</a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
