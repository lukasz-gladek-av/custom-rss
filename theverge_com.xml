            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has decided to delay the release window of its upcoming <em>Fable </em>game to 2026. The Xbox maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer">originally said last year</a> that <em>Fable</em> would arrive at some point in 2025, but now Xbox Game Studios chief Craig Duncan has provided an update on the game during an appearance on the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8">official Xbox podcast</a>.</p><p>“We previously announced the date for <em>Fable</em> as 2025, we are actually going to give <em>Fable </em>more time and it’s going to ship in 2026 now,” says Duncan. “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait. I have unequivocable confidence in the Playground team.”</p><p>We got to see some early gameplay footage of <em>Fable </em>at last year’s Xbox summer showcase, which was largely focused on the characters and story of the fantasy game. <em>Fable </em>will be centered on a hero named Humphry, who “will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence.” Microsoft provided a little more gameplay footage today, too.</p><p>Playground Games is the developer behind this latest <em>Fable </em>installment, best-known for their work on the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series. “What they’re bringing to the <em>Fable </em>franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect from Playground Games, plus amazing gameplay, British humor, and Playground’s take… in quite frankly the most beautifully realized version of Albion that you’ve ever seen,” says Duncan.</p><p>Microsoft still has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">busy year of Xbox games ahead</a>, including <em>South of Midnight</em>, id Software’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, and potentially even <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
