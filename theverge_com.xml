Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24213585/nvidia-app-update-rtx-video-display-features">recently added</a> the display settings, RTX Video HDR sliders, and RTX Video Super Resolution support into this new app.</p><p>This new Nvidia app will also be bundled as an optional install as part of Nvidia’s GeForce drivers, and you won’t even need to log into an Nvidia account to use it. “With the official launch of Nvidia app today, migration of GeForce Experience and Nvidia RTX Experience features is complete, and the new app will soon be optionally bundled as part of our Game Ready Driver and Studio Ready Drivers,” says Nvidia.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
