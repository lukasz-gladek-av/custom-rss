The device, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030930/sony-vr-spatial-smart-control-ring-ces">which Sony first teased at CES last year</a>, will come with 4K OLED displays, video passthrough, and support for third-party design, modeling, and production software.</p><p>Based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBmlGIiAOE&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvoxmedia.stories.usechorus.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE">video shared by Sony</a>, it looks like wearers will be able to flip up the headset when they’re not using it. It doesn’t appear to come with the ring and pointer that Sony showed off last year, though.</p><p>Alongside the headset, Sony revealed Xyn Motion Studio, an accompanying Windows app that supports up to 12 Mocopi sensors, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23780187/sony-mocopi-motion-capture-vr-avatar-us-price-release">wireless motion-tracking system</a> that V-Tubers and other creators often use to control virtual avatars. The software comes with motion-editing features, allowing creators to trim and merge motions, as well as adjust time and position.</p><p>There’s also a prototype of a “spatial capture solution,” which is supposed to transform images of real objects and spaces into “photorealistic” 3D computer-generated assets using Sony’s algorithm. One year out from Sony’s initial teaser, and details are still pretty slim on what exactly this headset will be capable of, aside from viewing and interacting with 3D objects.</p><p>Sony is planning to release its Xyn Motion Studio software in late March 2025, but there still isn’t any word on the availability or pricing of its headset.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s limited to smaller items like socks, tissues, or anything weighing less than 300 grams, but the company plans to eventually expand what it can grasp. Pricing isn’t known, but Roborock says the Saros Z70 will be available by June 2025.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">Samsung The Frame Pro TV</a></h3></p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Samsung’s The Frame TV appealed to many consumers with an aesthetically pleasing design and the ability to camouflage itself as a piece of art in a home’s decor. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">The Frame Pro further expands the TV’s appeal</a> to more discerning TV viewers with a variation on Mini LED display technology, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009799/samsung-the-frame-2022-preview-matte-display-artwork">matte finish introduced in 2022</a>, and a wireless connection to its breakout box so all you need to hide is a power cord.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday smart glasses</a></h3></p><p>With the success of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>, it’s no surprise that several companies are debuting smart glasses at CES 2025. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday’s new enhanced specs</a>, which are expected to ship “by the end of Q1 2025” and cost between $399 and $499, are differentiated with the addition of a small screen on the frame.

The feature eliminates the need to keep your head positioned in a sweet spot for optimal sound, and it could be ideal for gamers who are constantly moving around in the heat of battle. The monitor also features a 120Hz refresh rate, a 0.03ms response time, and will launch in the US on May 22nd, 2025, for $799.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337124/bird-buddy-wonder-petal-camera-track-plants-insects-ces-2025">Wonder plant and insect camera</a></h3></p><p>Bird Buddy is moving on to smaller flying creatures of the outdoors.

You’ll be able to view a livestream from your phone, while an optional solar panel can keep the 4K camera running. It’s supposed to launch on Kickstarter this spring.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">Mirumi</a></h3></p><p>Mirumi is a robot that you might actually want to own.

The answer might be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price">Acer’s new Nitro Blaze 11 featuring a beefy 10.95-inch 144 Hz WQXGA touch display</a> that makes it look like you’re holding a small monitor instead of a portable console.

It’s also got a built-in kickstand so you don’t have to strain your arms by always playing it handheld.

It’s a MagSafe power bank with a 10,000mAh battery, a retractable USB-C cable, and a design that adds a camera-like grip to the iPhone. It’s even got a physical shutter button that works with the iOS camera app over Bluetooth and a small LCD screen on the front showing the battery’s remaining charge. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the PowerGrip will come in several color options.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp Thunderbolt displays announced at CES have been updated with new IPS panels that provide 120Hz refresh rates alongside features designed to enhance visual comfort.</p><p>The UltraSharp line is a popular choice for working professionals who need a no-frills 4K monitor that supports Windows, macOS, and multi-monitor setups — the 27-inch model in particular tops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-4k-monitors">of</a> <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/best/by-resolution/4k-ultra-hd-uhd">lists</a> for best 4K monitor. 120Hz refresh rates are usually targeted toward gamers who can benefit from higher frame rates and smoother, more responsive gameplay, which now makes the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K in particular a decent solution for people who want a single display that’s suitable for both work <em>and</em> play.</p><p>The improvements come at a cost though: the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K is increasing to $699.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $639.99 for the 60Hz model</a>), and the larger 32-inch UltraSharp 4K now costs $949.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $919.99</a>). Both will be available to buy globally starting February 25th, according to Dell.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a look at what the new 32-inch Dell UltraSharp 4K monitor looks like from the front.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944722/dell-ultrasharp-u2424h-u2424he-u2724d-u2724de-120hz-price-release-date-specs-features">120Hz monitors to the UltraSharp lineup in 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024951/dell-ultrasharp-curved-thunderbolt-monitor-u4025qw-u3425we-price-release-date-specs-features">2024</a>, but this is the first time that the popular 27-inch 4K model has seen a similar refresh rate boost. Other improvements for the new UltraSharp 4K models include up to 140W power delivery via USB-C (up from 90W), and a 3,000:1 contrast ratio, thanks to its use of “enhanced IPS Black technology” that provides 47 percent deeper blacks compared to conventional IPS panels, according to Dell. The prior version of IPS Black offered a 2,000:1 contrast ratio. A comparison showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPXQdLfKMRs">improvements in contrast ratio can be seen in this YouTube video</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Besides some changes to the port selection and a new ventilation grill, the new UltraSharp 4K monitors look visually similar to the previous models.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell says the monitors include an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness and color temperature to help reduce eye fatigue. Otherwise, the 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp share near-identical designs with their predecessors. The new models include VESA DisplayHDR 600 and ports for USB-A, USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and DisplayPort, with ventilation grills now surrounding the ports located on the back of the monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
