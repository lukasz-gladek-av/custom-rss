My favorite (and arguably the most stylish) among the bunch is the Puff Pouch carrying case. Its design evokes the look of a puffy jacket, if not quite to the level of premium puffiness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FmppnElGjvk">Apple’s zip-up case for the Vision Pro headset</a>.</p><p>The Puff Pouch zips open and shut, with a handle on one of its long sides. It boasts room for the console, up to six game cartridges, and extra accessories, like a small battery, the power brick, or a webcam. Even though there’s a Switch 2 logo patch embroidered into the pouch’s fabric, there’s nothing stopping you from using it with an original Switch instead. That’ll be our little secret. Originally priced at $44.99, this case is $29.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pouch-Black-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63YT3C9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and comes out June 16th.</p><p>For an extra $5 (totaling to $34.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Adventure-Pack-Black-Shoulder-Officially/dp/B0F63VZ6N2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>), you might prefer Hori’s Switch 2 crossbody shoulder bag. It offers a similar amount of storage capacity to the Puff Pouch, and can also be used to tote the Switch 2, or any of the original Switch models. As an alternative to wearing the bag, you can also carry it by hand with its strap. This one comes out June 30th.</p><p>The last (for now) discounted Hori product is its Dual USB PlayStand, a small USB hub that gives your console more ports for accessories, much like the TV dock does. It has two USB-A ports for controllers, plus a USB-C port in case you want to keep your Switch 2 charged as you play. Normally $69.99 (whew, that’s costly), it’s selling at a more reasonable (but still pretty steep) $39.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Dual-PlayStand-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63VJ13M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. This product also releases on June 30th.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
