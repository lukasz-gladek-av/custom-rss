            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of games have been released for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate since it launched in 2022</a>, as a quick browse of <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a> will attest. But still, there’s something unique about the handheld’s seasonal format, which just kicked off its second iteration. When it first launched, the Playdate came with 24 games from notable indie developers that were steadily released on a weekly cadence, making a perfect introduction to the little yellow device and its crank. Now, a few years later, we finally have season 2, and it’s off to a solid start — and it even includes a bizarre mystery.</p><p>The new season runs for the next six weeks and totals a dozen games, two of which will drop each week. <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">The entire collection will run you $39</a>. To start, we have a pair of very different games. <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>, from <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em> developer Subset Games, is sort of like a modern take on <em>Asteroids</em>. You control a little ship in the middle and fire guns at little squares flying toward you. The twist is that you use the crank to rotate the ship around and aim your shots. There’s also something of a roguelike element, where you steadily unlock random upgrades like new weapons or a larger spread for your bullets. The goal is to last for 10 straight minutes.</p><p>It’s a pretty challenging game — so far, I’ve only really had success on easy mode — but it’s also surprisingly chill, eliciting that sort of zen state that the best shooters and puzzle games can create. This is helped by its lo-fi soundtrack that pretty much demands you play with headphones on. It’s an absorbing game.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is <em>Dig Dig Dino!</em>, developed by Dom2D and Fáyer, who brag that the game “is perfect to play while watching TV! No time pressure, no quick reflexes needed!” It’s a puzzle game where you travel to different dig sites to uncover dinosaur bones, artifacts, and trash. You only have a limited amount of moves per dig, but you can upgrade your capacity over time — while also getting new tools to smash rocks or dig deeper — letting you dig both more and for longer. It’s sort of like a really cute take on <em>Minesweeper</em>, one clearly designed for short play sessions. It’s not exactly difficult, but there’s still something satisfying about uncovering a large dinosaur bone when you’re just about to run out of moves.</p><p>These two games do a good job of showing the breadth of games possible on the Playdate; one is meant for quick bursts, the other for longer, more focused sessions. But the launch week package is rounded out by something a whole lot weirder. It’s called <em>Blippo Plus</em> and, well, it’s a series of TV channels you can flip between using the crank. Some are nothing but static, while others have giant FMV videos of strange TV shows or commercials. One show, called <em>Tantric Computing,</em> is nothing but closeup shots of someone using a computer mouse. Another, <em>Werf’s Tavern</em>, is some kind of musical talk show. There’s also a messaging tool and some kind of fax service.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Blippo Plus</em>, though, isn’t just that it’s odd. It’s also a mystery that seems like it will evolve over the course of the season. Playdate maker Panic says that “Playdate season 2 owners should tune in weekly and make sure they are connected to WiFi when season 2 updates at 10 AM PT on Thursdays.” There are lots of other promising games planned for season 2, including the point-and-click adventure <em>Shadowgate PD</em> and whatever the heck <em>Long Puppy</em> and <em>Tiny Turnip</em> are.</p><p>But an FMV mystery that unfolds over the course of weeks is something that’s pretty unique to this format — and further evidence that the Playdate exists in its own parallel universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
