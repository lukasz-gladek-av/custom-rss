It’s not clear at the moment why the app is now gone, but it seems likely that it was the developer, not Nintendo, that prompted its removal.</p><p>Developer Exophase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091561/nintendo-lawsuit-fallout-yuzu">made Drastic free-to-download last year</a> and indicated that it planned to remove the app from Google Play and open-source its code, though that doesn’t seem to have ever happened. The announcement came after a Nintendo settlement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">took down Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra, something the developer said wasn’t reponsible for its decision, but did accelerate the timeline.</p><p>Exophase did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><div><p>The loss of Drastic is a hit to the broader emulator scene, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">rocked by Nintendo’s legal moves</a> against Yuzu last year. But despite that, there is now a flourishing iOS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream">emulator marketplace</a>, thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">surprise change</a> to Apple’s App Store guidelines last year.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
