Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has released an official Nintendo Store app, allowing more fans to access the eShop on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Five years after exclusively launching in Japan as the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nintendo-launches-my-nintendo-app-japan/">My Nintendo</a>” app, Nintendo has now expanded the iOS and Android experience under a new name to other regions, including the US, UK, Canada, and most of Europe.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">App Store</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.znej" rel="sponsored">Play Store</a> listings, the Nintendo Store app allows users to browse and purchase Switch 2 and Switch consoles, hardware accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo merchandise. The app will open a page on your device’s default web browser when products are selected, rather than allow you to complete purchases in-app, but it’s still a more convenient way to access the Nintendo eShop compared to manually visiting the mobile browser storefront.</p><p>A Nintendo account and network ID are required to access some app features, including the ability to check historical gaming activity, showing what games you played, when you played them, and how long for. This includes Switch and Switch 2 data, along with the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, though the latter two consoles will only show play activity up to February 2020. Players could only previously access this information by setting up parental controls.</p><p>Other features include the ability to set push notifications for when items saved to your wish list go on sale, and a news feed for the latest Nintendo games and events. The app also gives users a way to earn rewards by using it to check in at official Nintendo stores and events. This is the latest of several destination apps that Nintendo has launched for its services, joining the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Music</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">Nintendo Today newsfeed app</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814054/nintendo-store-app-ios-android-games-shop]]></content:encoded>
