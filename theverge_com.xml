            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/675179/ps5-pro-bundle-dualsense-console-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Contrary to widespread concern that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">Sony was about to increase the cost</a> of the PlayStation 5 in the US, the company is — for now, at least — cutting gamers a break with costs through June 11th. Select PS5 bundles, including the PS5 Pro, PlayStation VR 2 headset, and other hardware are discounted for no apparent reason. Nope, nothing’s coming up on the game console release calendar that might have caused Sony to…wait.</p><p>The $449.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Switch 2</a> comes out June 5th, yet for $50 less, you can get a <strong>PS5 bundled with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></strong> from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystation5-digital-edition-console-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bundle-model-group-slim" rel="sponsored">Sony</a> directly or <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPS5-Digital-Bundle-Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6%2F16184301720" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. Presumably, consoles still come with <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> pre-installed, so that’s <em>two</em> free games with purchase. I’m feeling good at the moment about the console’s staying power after seeing that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662834/gta-6-trailer-gameplay-ps5">latest <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> trailer was apparently running on a base PS5</a>. If it looks <em>that </em>good on 2020 hardware, I’d love to see it running on a PS5 Pro.</p><p>Speaking of which, the <strong>PS5 Pro</strong> is getting its first-ever discount. It’s a small drop at $50, but we’ll certainly take that versus a $50 price increase. At $649.99 from <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=675179&amp;action=edit#:~:text=https%3A//www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H">Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-playstation-5-pro-console-white%2F6601524.p%3FskuId%3D6601524" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, you’re getting Sony’s most powerful PS5 that has a larger GPU, more storage, and the ability to use Sony’s own PSSR AI upscaling technology to make games look and run better than they might otherwise.</p><p>The PS5 Pro’s improved power is more obvious when you’re directly comparing your screen to one showing original PS5 footage; there currently aren’t any games that benefit from the hardware to the extent that it’s easy to recommend the pricey console, which is normally $699.99. Perhaps, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will prove to be that game when it launches 2026, unless late 2025’s <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, or another title, blows our socks off before then. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">Read our review of the PS5 Pro.</a></p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->649</span></p><div><p>The “pro” version of Sony’s PlayStation 5 has a bigger GPU, new PSSR AI-based upscaling, advanced ray tracing, and 2TB SSD (with expandable storage).

Per The Pokémon Company International’s <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Release-Date-for-Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Revealed-and-Pokemon-Presents-Vid">press release</a>, preorders for digital versions of the games will begin June 5th on the Nintendo eShop. And according to <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/1927711523243171979?s=46">a post on the company’s official Japanese X profile</a>, preorders for physical editions of the games start July 23rd.</p><p>On July 22nd, TCPi is also putting on another Pokémon Presents streaming presentation focused on <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, which will likely reveal even more of the games’ new monsters and details about its story. The Pokémon Presents’ timing definitely makes it seem like Nintendo intends on getting people hyped up to secure their copies. And given how generally tightlipped the company has been about <em>Legends: Z-A </em>so far, this next presentation is probably going to be one worth watching.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
