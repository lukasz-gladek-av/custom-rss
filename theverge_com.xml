He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> will be a console exclusive on Nintendo Switch systems when it eventually launches out of early access. Nintendo announced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5-bringing-new-forms-of-game-communication-to-life%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor48gIQRe3AJfpPKWtNEnIbCV0UefifG398la8AdB4asWFv2Mni" rel="sponsored">last week</a> that the game was coming to the Switch and Switch 2, and today, the company released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">Creator’s Voice video</a> highlighting more about the game.</p><p>In the video, Supergiant employees don’t get very specific about the Switch 2 version of the game, but do say 60 fps gameplay is important to them and that they’ll be able to “push some of the graphical features with the extra power” of the system. Otherwise, the video is a good place to start if you haven’t been keeping up with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades</em> sequel</a>, which is in early access on PC, and want to know what it’s all about. </p><p>Despite a screen in the video that says <em>Hades II</em> will launch “first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2,” developer Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909615715642196067">clarified on X</a> that the game is also launching on the original Switch when it reaches v1.0. Supergiant is promising to share more information about <em>Hades II</em>, which doesn’t have a set release date, “later this year.”</p><p>My colleague Jay Peters has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access">written about how much fun he’s having</a> with <em>Hades II</em>. Maybe it’s time I finally try again to beat the final boss in the first <em>Hades</em>. I made it there once, lost in the second phase of the battle, and just haven’t been back since.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But in a post Monday night, YouTube said the restrictions shouldn’t have been applied.</p><p>“Videos featuring <em>Balatro</em> gameplay should not be age-restricted,” YouTube <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1909446185598996790">says in a post on X</a>. We’re reviewing the age-restrictions on these videos and conducting a platform-wide review. Thanks for your patience as we fix!”</p><p>YouTube’s post is a reply to <em>Balatro’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/634123/balatro-localthunk-developer-anonymous-update">anonymous developer</a>, LocalThunk, who shared the Balatro University video <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620740435280288">Monday afternoon</a>. “Good thing we are protecting children from knowing what a 4 of a kind is and letting them watch [<em>Counter-Strike</em>] case opening videos instead,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620319381717301">LocalThunk said</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, a roguelike that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">borrows ideas from poker</a>, doesn’t actually involve gambling. But the game received a PEGI 18 rating in Europe after it launched because it “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling,” as quoted by publisher Playstack <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">at the time</a>. LocalThunk also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi">expressed his displeasure</a> with that rating.</p><p>However, in February, PEGI revised <em>Balatro’s</em> rating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618342/balatro-pegi-rating-appeal">to PEGI 12</a> following an appeal and said it would “develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, the company delayed preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">in the US</a> because of the potential impact of the Trump administration’s new tariffs.</p><p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada will not start on April 9, 2025 in order to align with the timing of preorders to be determined in the US,” Nintendo of Canada said to <em>MobileSyrup</em>. “Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date.
