            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/675764/polygon-guides-writers-big-friendly-guide-new-site<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of <em>Polygon</em>’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website: <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, which you can find at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/">bigfriendly.guide</a>. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site.</p><p>Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.”</p><p>“I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23728443/giant-white-stallion-horse-god-find-tame">getting a giant horse in <em>Zelda</em></a>.</p><p><em>Big Friendly Guide</em> will make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans.</p><p>There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’s <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/about-us/">About Us page</a>.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to.</p><p>The release of <em>Big Friendly Guide</em> is just the latest outlet from <em>Polygon</em> staffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launched <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-award-that-changes-the-lives">the <em>Post Games</em> podcast</a> and former curation editor Pete Volk launched <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lootykftkk2v">the <em>PV Guide</em> newsletter</a>. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications like <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter"><em>Aftermath</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview"><em>Game File</em></a>.</p><p>With <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, Gilliam and Parkin have modest expectations. “We’re not looking to build a brand and sell it or anything,” Parkin says. “I don’t think either of us want to get particularly rich. We want to keep doing this. That’s really what it comes down to.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/677230/valorant-unreal-engine-5-replays-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Riot Games is planning to switch <em>Valorant</em>, its popular first-person tactical hero shooter, over to Unreal Engine 5 in July. The engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 is part of a number of new changes coming to the shooter over the coming months, including a replay system in September.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>has been running on Unreal Engine 4 since a beta of the game originally released in 2020, and Riot Games has been using Unreal 4 for more than 10 years to build the game. The upgrade to Unreal 5 will arrive with patch 11.02 at the end of July, and Riot is promising it shouldn’t disrupt gameplay.</p><p>The game’s overall look and feel should be similar, and Riot says the engine upgrade will improve framerate performance and make patch downloads faster in the future. It’ll be interesting to see what else this engine upgrade unlocks, particularly whether Riot will improve character models and animations in the future. <em>Valorant </em>players that log in while patch 11.02 is live will get a special gun buddy to commemorate the upgrade.</p><p>The second big upgrade coming to <em>Valorant </em>later this year is the long-requested replay system. It will arrive on PC first with patch 11.06 in September, followed by a release on console later this year. The replay system will let you analyze recently played competitive games at launch, and Riot is looking at adding more modes later.</p><p>The replay system should help players report cheating or bad player behavior in <em>Valorant</em>, and Riot is also adding multi-factor authentication to the game to help with smurfing in the competitive modes — where higher ranked players log into accounts to boost them. You’ll also soon be able to report accounts that are abusing rank or matchmaking.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s upcoming 11.0 patch later this month will also add a new map to the game, and it will be available in the competitive mode on day one. During the initial patch cycle of two weeks, rank rating (RR) losses on this new map will be cut by 50 percent while <em>Valorant </em>players get used to playing this new map.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just look for the “EX” — and the higher price tag.</p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-30T16:15:00+00:00">May 30, 2025, 4:15 PM UTC</time></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>All microSD cards look pretty much the same, but when it comes to buying the right one for your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, only microSD Express cards will work for storing and playing games. The microSD card you used in your original Switch or Switch Lite will offer limited functionality with Nintendo’s new handheld, as it will only let you view screenshots or video clips you captured previously — that’s it.</p><p>That’s because Nintendo opted for a significantly faster spec in its new handheld console, which boasts an advertised 4.4x improvement in terms of transfer speeds over the microSD cards you might already have lying around. That improvement is signified by a small, easy-to-miss “EX” emblem etched onto the front of the card.</p><p>What’s harder to miss is how much more expensive Express cards are, with some costing more than $50 for just 256GB of storage. The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards up to 2TB in size, although 1TB is the largest capacity widely available (that’s an overstatement, as many are sold out currently), with some cards selling for up to $200 a pop. Phew. I suppose it makes sense that they’re pricier since they’re classified as bonafide PCIe NVMe SSDs by the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/pdf/SD_Cards_8_0_WhitePaper20200515.pdf">SD Association</a>. Walmart’s Onn label is a beacon of light, as its microSD Express cards are significantly cheaper than the competition, with its <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">512GB model costing $65.88</a> when it’s in stock.</p><p>Thankfully, since the Switch 2 has 256GB of built-in storage, you most likely won’t need a microSD Express card immediately upon receiving your console. Getting a microSD card was a rite of passage with the original Switch since all versions, aside from the newer OLED edition that launched in 2021, came with just 32GB.</p><p>If you’re in the market for one of these pricier storage expansion cards ahead of the console’s launch, we’ve listed the available options below.</p><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->55</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
