            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617336/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The fuzz of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, alongside static grains and flickering scanlines, is a touchstone for ’90s-era nostalgia. It’s shorthand for those halcyon days when technology was predominantly analog and millennial kids spent their summers shoving bulky tapes into VHS players, recording favorite bits of their after-school television shows, and making their own home videos with camcorders. It’s this vignette that developer Don’t Nod Montréal leans heavily into in <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. </em>The game follows a blossoming friendship — and apparent falling-out — of four teenagers over an unforgettable summer. And it all starts with a good dose of that nostalgia: the ubiquitously blue anti-drug message that precedes the title screen, complete with the telltale flicker of a CRT monitor.</p><p>Such adolescent longing is all par for the course for Don’t Nod. Alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead">Telltale</a>, the studio popularized the choose-your-own-adventure style of narrative games with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">Life is Strange</a></em>, while foregrounding the outsized pain and tribulations of teenhood. But more than just coating teenage drama in a layer of dreamy nostalgia, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is also an opportunity for Don’t Nod to write a story based in familiar settings. The era already has its own vocabulary and culture; it’s the era of riot grrrl, Bikini Kill, <em>The</em> <em>Blair Witch Project</em>, and video rental stores. Doing so helps <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> avoid the criticism of penning teenage slang and using outdated references that sound like they’re written by much older adults. This means a lot less “hella cool” and more “let’s bounce,” which is <em>definitely </em>a phrase I remember using as a teenager.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> looks like another <em>Life is Strange</em>. Every moment is infused with the same emotional weight the series is known for, be it standing up to a bully or excitedly gushing about your new best friend to your cat. Then there’s the tinge of the supernatural. But while promising, it’s a tad early to see if <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> can surpass the juggernaut that was the original <em>Life is Strange</em>. That’s because <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a two-part adventure game — a nod to the episodic roots of its forebears — with the second half of the game expected to release in mid-April this year.</p><p>Set in the small town of Velvet Cove, you’ll play as Swann, one of the four central teenagers. The story is depicted across two time periods: the present-day Swann as an adult meeting her long-lost friends decades later, and her earlier days as an awkward teenager during the summer of ’95.</p><p>The first few minutes of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> neatly set the stage. At first, the adult Swann is struggling with a tedious, mostly one-sided conversation with her mother over the phone, and she can choose to respond meekly, with indifference, or mere silence. Meanwhile, lots of objects in the vicinity are available for her to fiddle with: a receipt, some brochures, and even a bottle of maple syrup. While examining these will cause Swann’s mother to chide her for being distracted, this also demonstrates how Don’t Nod is expanding the ways in which dialogue can play out. You can look at specific objects and this will, at times, open up new dialogue choices that can influence your current and future conversations with other characters. It’s a small addition, but it helps make conversations feel more authentic, rather than simply choosing between binary choices of playing nice or being rude.</p><p>Flashbacks to Swann’s younger days make up the bulk of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage’</em>s first half, with the teenager navigating the thorny passage of adolescent friendships. In the beginning, Swann is a loner, largely reluctant to socialize and too awkward to belong anywhere — the familiar plight of every millennial teenager. Spending her days memorializing almost every waking moment with a camcorder, Swann will meticulously record clips of anything that catches her eye, before putting them together to make short films. Aside from the conversations, documenting Swann’s everyday life is the game’s central conceit, a bold gamble given how this can feel like busywork at first.</p><p>From fulfilling objectives that move the storyline along, such as filming the local video store (it’s one of Swann’s favorite haunts), to discovering collectibles in the form of crude graffiti and exotic birds, this almost reduces the game to an object-hunting adventure. Eventually, you may develop the tendency to just whip out the camcorder the moment cutscenes conclude. But there’s a lingering charm to this approach, highlighting how Swann tends to instinctively interact with the people around her through her camcorder. Making films is the one thing that empowers her. This is all the more poignant as she eventually comes out of her shell and hides less behind her lens.</p><p>And then there are Swann’s newfound friends — Nora, Autumn, and Kat — who similarly are more than just one-dimensional caricatures. There’s Nora who, for all her bravado and punk rock sensibilities, is one of the most conflict-averse individuals in the group and the quickest to suggest giving up when they get into trouble. Then there are seemingly villainous folks who are more multifaceted than what their initial hostility suggests, which isn’t revealed until you examine their behavior and personal artifacts.</p><p>These point toward complexities that a young Swann may not fully comprehend, evident in some of her childlike responses, but that the older Swann — and by extension, the player — can probably recognize. This is what Don’t Nod has always been adept at: crafting believable and deeply human characters and the abundant world that they inhabit.</p><p>Experiencing the idyllic memories of Swann’s days with her friends can be deeply emotional, as if chancing upon a time capsule you’ve forgotten about. These are long-buried moments about engaging in hours-long phone calls with close friends, partaking in rambunctious activities on the fly, and waxing lyrical about larger-than-life ambitions, like playing in famous bands or living in a secret getaway, hidden from the prying eyes of untrustworthy adults.</p><p>Seeing Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat trade lifelong promises and form intense bonds — ones so characteristic of deep female friendships — will hit close to home for many. It’s this juxtaposition between these idyllic scenes and the constant, foreboding reminder of the group’s inevitable fallout that feels so ominous, unnerving, and perhaps a little painful. And the vague, supernatural happenings only serve to heighten the anxieties of teenhood. Whether it serves a deeper, more metaphorical purpose still remains to be seen. </p><p>The first half of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> ends in a dramatic cliffhanger, of course, but it’s one that’s not quite as audacious as it seems. Some hints have been hiding in plain sight. But a small concern lingers. Stories like these often introduce so many twists that could derail the game, before the story goes off the rails so quickly that it inevitably plummets. This was partly why the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a> faltered in its concluding chapters. For now, there’s plenty of time to wonder; we still have to wait two more months or so for <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s melodramatic conclusion.</p><p><sub>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage <em>is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Lenovo Legion Go S was supposed to change things. It was poised to show Valve isn’t the only one that can build an affordable, portable, potent handheld gaming PC — you just need the right design and the right OS. </p><p>I was intrigued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">when Valve’s own Steam Deck designers told me</a> this Windows handheld would double as the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld this May. When I heard Lenovo had procured an exclusive AMD chip that would help that SteamOS version hit $499, I got excited for a true Steam Deck competitor. </p><p>But I’m afraid that chip ain’t it. </p><p>I’ve spent weeks living with a Legion Go S powered by AMD’s Z2 Go, the same chip slated to appear in that $499 handheld. I’ve used it with both Windows and Bazzite, a SteamOS-like Linux distro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">that eliminates many of Windows’ most annoying quirks</a>. I tested both directly against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a Steam Deck OLED</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a>, expecting to find it between the two in terms of performance and battery life. But that’s not what I found.</p><p>Watt for watt, its Z2 Go chip simply can’t compete with the Steam Deck, and it’s far weaker than the Z1 Extreme in last year’s handhelds. That’s inexcusable at the $730 price you’ll currently pay for the Windows version, and I won’t be the first reviewer to say so. But with this less efficient chip and a mere 55 watt-hour battery, I worry the Legion Go S isn’t a good choice at all.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->730</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li><li>Fast 100W charging</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Performance is too low</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><p>I <em>want</em> to say that the Legion Go S “makes a great first impression,” but Windows 11 still features a terrible out-of-box experience. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates to install and dismissing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196408/dark-patterns-are-everywhere">dark-patterned</a> offers for Microsoft products that have no business being on my handheld gaming machine. </p><p>Still, the Go S is built far better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the original Legion Go</a>, whose flat-faced controllers felt awkward in my hands. The new portable has some of the best-sculpted grips I’ve felt on a handheld, though their smooth texture can feel a little slippery. I’d have gone with more aggressive stippling to help me hold its 1.61-pound weight.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But its buttons all feel precise and secure, if the triggers are longer than I’d like, and its concave-topped, drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks feel comfy and wonderfully smooth to spin. The only weak control is the touchpad, which is so tiny I flick repeatedly to move the cursor an inch at a time.</p><p>Audio is much improved from front-facing speakers, and a larger fan moves more air while staying quieter than before. And it’s one of the fastest-charging handhelds yet — I clocked each of its top-mounted USB 4 ports drawing a full 100 watts of USB-C PD power during actual use. The cooling and charging are so good, Lenovo lets you crank the chip up to 40-watt TDP while it’s plugged in or 33 watts on battery alone.</p><p>But as you’ll see in my benchmark charts, the Z2 Go simply isn’t in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck OLED’s “Sephiroth” chip. In some games, it can’t beat the Steam Deck at all, even if you plug it in and crank it all the way up. </p><div><h2>Legion Go S 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go (Z1 Extreme)</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E vs. Z2 Go</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td>11.36%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>63</td><td>14.55%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>15.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>71</td><td>14.52%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>52</td><td>73</td><td>12.31%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>52</td><td>42</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>31.71%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td><td>59</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>61</td><td>32.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>26.53%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>70</td><td>61</td><td>8.93%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>84</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td><td>89</td><td>34.85%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td><td>91</td><td>35.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>92</td><td>31.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>38.89%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>40.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>34</td><td>33</td><td>37.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td><td>38</td><td>46.15%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td><td>40</td><td>37.93%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>41</td><td>36.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>26</td><td>38</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>61</td><td>50</td><td>-5.66%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>30.19%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>75</td><td>36.36%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td><td>73</td><td>14.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>75</td><td>15.38%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

With the Steam Deck, which runs at 15-watt TDP, I can average 52 frames per second at an upscaled 720p resolution and low settings on battery power alone. But even if I feed the Legion Go S with 40 watts and plug it into a wall, the open-world game runs <em>slower</em> at 49fps. And that’s <em>after</em> a new set of drivers; the shipping ones were much worse.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>In other games, cranking up Lenovo’s TDP by five, 10, or 15 watts can give it a comfortable lead over the Deck. But that significantly impacts battery. In Lenovo’s default 25W “Performance” mode, I saw some games run just as smoothly as on the Deck — but with total system power consumption of around 36 watts, draining the handheld’s 55 watt-hour battery in about an hour and a half. The Steam Deck, which drains at around 22 to 24 watts at full bore, lasts two hours at the same smoothness.</p><p>I have possible good news about SteamOS: when I installed Bazzite, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck#:~:text=In%20a%20lot%20of%20ways%20Bazzite%20is%20a%20good%20way%20to%20kind%20of%20get%20the%20latest%20and%20greatest%20of%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20been%20working%20on%2C%20and%20test%20it.%E2%80%9D">which can serve as a decent preview</a> of what SteamOS might look and feel like, I saw frame rates improve by an average of 16 percent in early tests (minus <em>Returnal</em>, which seems to hate Linux for some reason), and Bazzite is <em>such</em> a breath of fresh air after attempting to use Windows. But it still didn’t reach Steam Deck performance unless I sacrificed more battery to get it. That works with a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">like the Asus ROG Ally X</a> with a big 80 watt-hour battery, but not so much here.</p><div><h2>Legion Go S Windows vs. Bazzite</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>42</td><td>52</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.27%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>60</td><td>52</td><td>22.45%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>70</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>74</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.46%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>80</td><td>N/A</td><td>21.21%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>25.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>70</td><td>17.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>-29.17%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>22</td><td>N/A</td><td>-15.38%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>-17.24%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>N/A</td><td>-16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>25</td><td>26</td><td>-21.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>51</td><td>61</td><td>-3.77%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>11.32%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>12.73%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>-1.56%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>0.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

In my tests, the original Legion Go with Z1E runs anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent faster comparing Windows to Windows — a lot for a handheld, where modern games struggle to reach smooth frame rates at all. </p><p>The Legion Go S does have an ace up its sleeve: its crisp, colorful 1920 x 1200 IPS screen looks better at lower resolutions than its predecessor’s 2560 x 1600 panel, and it runs more smoothly at lower frame rates now that it has VRR to adjust its refresh rate anywhere between 48Hz and 120Hz on the fly. I would not buy a Legion Go over a Legion Go S for this reason alone. </p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>And if you primarily play games that don’t require performance, the Legion Go S is a bit more efficient at lower wattage: by setting TDP, brightness, and refresh rate low, I was able to achieve a total of just 7.5W battery drain in Windows and 7W in Bazzite while playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">magic math poker game <em>Balatro</em></a>. That should net me seven to eight hours of battery life, and you should be able to hit the four-hour mark without those tricks just by setting the Legion Go S to its 8-watt TDP “Quiet” mode. When I played the similarly easy to run <em>Slay the Spire</em> on the original Legion Go, pulling out all the stops, I couldn’t even reach five hours.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, the Steam Deck does efficiency better. Simply limiting frame rate to 25fps and brightness to 40 percent can yield over eight hours of <em>Balatro </em>on the Deck, and I’ve gotten four hours, 42 minutes in <em>Dave the Diver</em> there. With the Legion Go S, my Dave only got 2.5 hours to hunt those sushi ingredients and blow up fake environmentalists!</p><p>I am comfortable saying <em>no one</em> should buy the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S, which costs $730 at Best Buy. Even if the performance, battery life, and price weren’t disqualifiers, Windows is a stain on this machine. And like other recent Windows handhelds I’ve tested, it does not reliably go to sleep and wake up again: I woke several mornings to find the system hot with fans spinning, even though I’d pressed the power button the previous evening. I found it uncomfortably warm pulling it out of my bag the other day. </p><p>Even if you prefer Windows to SteamOS, you can get notably better performance and far better battery life from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, which is worth every extra penny, particularly since it doubles as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the best Bazzite machine you can buy</a>. </p><p>But even if you add Bazzite to the Legion Go S, it’s no Steam Deck, and I’m not sure that’ll change by May. If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead. </p><div><div><p id="agree-to-continue-legion-go-s"><h2>Agree to Continue: Legion Go S</h2></p></div><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.

During every hand, you have a certain amount of energy you can use to play your dice. And since you can see every move your enemies will make on the next turn, the game is mostly about strategizing how to attack the baddies while defending yourself.</p><p>If you’ve played <em>Slay</em>, this setup should feel pretty familiar.</p><p>But <em>Dungeon</em>’s clever twist is in <em>how</em> you play. At the beginning of each turn, the game will roll dice from your deck into your hand, and you’ll need to decide how to play them on a board. Each die has a value, so the higher the value, the more damage you’ll deal or block you’ll set up to defend yourself.</p><p>There are multiple types of dice, including attack dice, block dice, healing dice, and dice that can boost the value of other dice on the board. Each one costs a certain amount of energy to play, which puts limits on how many you can use in one turn. And sometimes, enemies will add modifiers to spots on the board.</p><div><p><cite>Image: HypeTrain Digital, INSTINCT3</cite></p></div><p>That all means you’ll have to think a lot about how and where you play your dice on the board. Do you go all in with attack dice to take a big chunk of an enemy’s health, but leave yourself vulnerable to attacks? Do you spend some energy on a boost block to give yourself more defense at the cost of being able to use a health dice? Just about every turn in <em>Dungeon</em> requires some strategic thinking.</p><p>The intensity of the strategy makes the <em>Slay</em>-esque trappings something of a comfort. I find <em>Dungeon</em> to be very hard; the enemies can really pack a punch if you’re caught off guard, and I haven’t been able to get past the bosses of the game’s first two worlds unless I have a clear idea of what my build is.</p><p>But I already understand how to think about building a deck from many hours of <em>Slay</em>. I’ve called on a lot of those skills to make things easier over the 10-plus hours I’ve put into <em>Dungeon</em> so far — and to accomplish my one and only cleared run.</p><p>While <em>Slay</em> is good at keeping things snappy with battles that are just long enough — I could often finish a run in around 45 minutes — runs in <em>Dungeon</em> can drag. Individual battles can take minutes on their own because of how much you might just sit and think. Loading screens that take five or more seconds add up over the course of a run. The dungeon maps also have a few too many spaces. My longer runs, where I’ve gotten to the third and final world, have taken nearly two hours.</p><p><em>Dungeon</em> is launching in early access, though, so I’m hoping the rougher edges will get smoothed out over time. Even over the couple weeks I’ve been playing the game, there have been some welcome updates, like one that gives you coins if you choose to skip an end-of-battle reward. The game’s developers have posted <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2026820%2Fview%2F497187441695785129" rel="sponsored">a promising roadmap, too</a>. That all makes me optimistic for <em>Dungeon</em>’s long-term future.</p><p>And its foundation is really strong. I’ve had a blast with <em>Dungeon</em>, despite its faults and me only having beaten the game with one of the three available characters so far. After I lose a run, I often mull over how I could have done things differently, and I’m usually eager to hop back in to roll the dice again.</p><p>I’ve been really looking forward to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320075/move-over-balatro"><em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>, which is supposed to come out in early access this year. But I might have already scratched the deckbuilding itch with <em>Die in the Dungeon</em>.</p><p><sub>Die in the Dungeon<em> is now available in early access on Steam.
