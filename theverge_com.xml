He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf is adding drift-resistant Hall effect sticks to updated versions of its wireless Envision and Reflex controllers. The revised models include the $149.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision</a> and $199.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision Pro</a> for PC as well as the $249.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-base-black">Reflex Pro</a> and $279.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-fps-steelgray">Reflex FPS</a> for PlayStation 5 and PC. Those are all starting prices, of course, as the Corsair-owned brand offers a wide variety of customization options that can take each model to even higher prices.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> upgrade brings Scuf’s wireless offerings in line with its wired-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller">Valor Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Nomad</a> mobile controllers, replacing the original Reflex and Envision pads that first debuted in 2021 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>Scuf is getting with the program on Hall effect sticks at a time when the magnetic, drift-resistant sensing option has become commonplace in other brands like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo</a>, Razer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, but hasn’t appeared in controllers from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo</a>, Sony, or Microsoft yet. But some controller makers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">already moving on</a> to a more power-efficient drift-resistant technology: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR sticks</a>.</p><p>Scuf controllers may be even pricier than premium controller options from Microsoft and Sony like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, but in my experience they’re nice for those willing to spend the money. They’re some of the few native wireless options for Xbox Series X / S and PS5, and Scuf’s rear paddles and clicky hair-trigger options are some of the best feeling “pro” upgrades around. The lack of drift resistant sticks has made it a little more challenging to recommend them, though. Take, for example, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">Xbox controller buying guide</a> where the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s#:~:text=A%20formidable%20alternative%20to%20the%20Elite">Razer Wolverine Pro V3</a> knocked off the Scuf Instinct Pro I used to personally love.</p><p>Better late than never, Scuf.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
