            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305474/sonic-3-trailer-chao-garden-detective-pikachu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are a handful of details <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">Parmount’s third <em>Sonic</em></a><em> </em>feature needs to get right in order for it to feel like a proper adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2,</em> and the movie’s latest trailer makes it look like it has the Chao Garden (arguably the best part of the game) on lock.</p><p>Though it features a few more shots of the Robotniks (Jim Carey) and Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) plotting to obliterate the earth, the highlight of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s new trailer are its new shots of the Chao Garden. While <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s Chao Garden was basically a daycare to raise magical little creatures, the movie reimagines it as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042393/the-world-definitely-does-not-need-a-chuck-e-cheese-game-show">Chuck E. Cheese</a>-like restaurant where Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his crew like to hang out as Chao mascots dance around on stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all the Chao merch on display, you’d almost think the tiny blob creatures were the <em>Pokémon </em>of the live-action <em>Sonic</em>’s world in terms of being part of a beloved video game franchise. But these kids and Knuckles (Idris Elba) all seem to have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a>, implying that the film was a successful movie adaptation in their world as well. Though Sonic’s Google Maps joke falls a little flat, the shots of Shadow using a weird orb to terrorize everyone gives him a bit of a <a href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Mewtwo_Ball">Mewtwo vibe</a> that feels fitting, given his being something of a misunderstood villain.</p><p>And while there’s no sign whether Rouge the Bat will make an appearance, the trailer’s a good reminder that the movie’s December 20th premiere is going to be an explosive one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
