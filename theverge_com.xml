            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> for a long time. Rumors of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">allegedly-real-but-never-released Switch Pro</a> swirled around for years as I watched fewer and fewer AAA third-party games make their way to Nintendo’s little console that could. There were always enough first-party titles and indie games to tide me over, but I watched with some envy as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">games like <em>Elden Ring</em></a> took the world by storm, knowing I’d have to wait until Nintendo’s next generation hardware arrived to add them to my Switch library. Now, finally, it’s here.</p><p>The Switch 2’s core strength for me boils down to it being a better version of the original Switch. Its 7.9-inch 120Hz 1080P screen looks sharp — yes, an OLED display would have been nicer, but I’m not complaining — and its ability to output at up to 4K, or up to 120Hz at lower resolutions, is a welcome improvement. It can play most original Nintendo Switch games, some of which have been updated through free or paid patches to run at a higher frame rate or resolution.</p><p>The only native Switch 2 game I’ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I picked up as part of a bundle with the system. My most-played game is the original Switch title <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which runs at 4K and 60 frames per second if you get the Switch 2 edition for $10 (it’s a free download if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription). That subscription also allows me to play a growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642436/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-f-zero-hands-on">GameCube games available as Nintendo Classics</a>, including titles I didn’t get to play when I was a kid.</p><p>I specifically put off playing games from my backlog, including titles going back several years, until I could play them on a larger display in handheld mode, and I don’t regret my decision. Putting dozens of hours into <em>Octopath Traveler</em> while chilling on the couch with the big-screen handheld was a heck of a lot of fun. Nintendo and third-party developers have also been pretty generous with releasing free demos of Nintendo Switch 2 titles, including <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, so it’s possible to sample bigger titles before deciding to pick them up.</p><p>My only real complaint with the Nintendo Switch 2 is its 256GB of internal storage, which isn’t enough for folks like me who’ve built up a large digital library of Switch games. Adding more requires you to pop in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-AM/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a><strong>, </strong>which can be twice the price of than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD512SA-AM/dp/B0C1PRYPYX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">regular microSD cards</a> used by the original Switch. My hope is that if a hardware revision comes down the line it’ll include an OLED display and at least 512GB of storage. By that time microSD Express cards will have hopefully become more affordable.</p><p>The console’s $449.99 starting price came as a shock to many, but it seems fair given its tech specs, and an escalating tariff situation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">delayed the Switch 2’s preorder timing</a> in North America and compelled Nintendo to raise the price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">original Nintendo Switch</a>. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">recently announced</a> that it “will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.” I’ll continue to look forward to exclusive titles making their way to my new console of choice, along with ports of third-party games that I haven’t gotten around to yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/845477/nintendo-switch-2-game-system-favorite]]></content:encoded>
