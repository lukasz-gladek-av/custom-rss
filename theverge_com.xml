Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been a long time coming, but EA is finally ready to show off the next <em>Battlefield</em>.</p><p>The new game, dubbed <em>Battlefield 6</em>, takes place during some kind of wide-ranging war; the debut trailer opens with a presidential address punctuated by explosions and destruction that seem to be happening all over the world. There’s not much in the way of gameplay in the trailer, but it looks like <em>Battlefield 6</em> will focus heavily on spectacle and set-pieces. A reveal of the game’s multiplayer is coming on July 31st where we’ll presumably be able to see more of it in action.</p><p>Here’s the official description from EA:</p><div><blockquote><p>The trailer offers a first look at Pax Armata, a Private Military Corporation bankrolled by former NATO states whose agenda threatens to throw the world into global conflict. This sets the scene for what players can expect on the battlefield — both in multiplayer and the return of the series’ single player campaign.</p><p>In <em>Battlefield 6</em>, the series’ incredible blend of visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom returns. Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage or take to the skies in white-knuckle dogfights. Take part in a war filled with tanks, fighter jets, and sweeping combat at a grand scale but remember: the deadliest weapon is your squad.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>It’s not clear yet when the game will launch, nor on what platforms, thought <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-release-in-october-for-80-leak-suggests-and-theres-an-open-beta-coming-too">leaks have pointed to an October debut on current-gen consoles and PC</a>.</p></div><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is also a massive production, being developed by four different studios under the banner “Battlefield Studios.” They include original developer DICE; <em>Burnout</em> and <em>Need for Speed</em> studio Criterion; EA Motive, the team behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">the <em>Dead Space</em> remake</a>; and a relatively new team known as Ripple Effect.</p><p>It’s a major moment for EA, particularly after the most recent game in the series — 2021’s <em>Battlefield 2042</em> — “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">did not meet expectations</a>,” according to the company. Battlefield 6 will be entering a market that is no less competitive, going up against annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases, including this year’s <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and entrenched live-service shooters like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712936/battlefield-6-trailer]]></content:encoded>
