            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/663070/skateboarding-games-tony-hawk-skate-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>More than 25 years after the first <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> put skateboarding games on the map, developers are still finding new ways to explore skating in video games, especially in 2025. Skateboarding fans are about to have some promising new games to play, with Activision’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622957/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-date-trailer-xbox-ps5-pc-switch"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> remake</a> releasing in July and EA is set to launch its online-only, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">free-to-play</a> <em>Skate</em> revival <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655766/the-grind">this year</a>. </p><p>In 2022, my colleague Andrew Webster wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23366589/session-skate-sim-skateboarding-games">we’re in a golden age for skateboarding games</a>, and things haven’t really slowed down. So what is it that makes skateboarding so good for video games, and allows so many different expressions of the sport from different studios?</p><p>“I think skateboarding is one of those things that’s just always cool,” <em>THPS 3 + 4</em> game director Kurt Tillmanns tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It’s an evergreen fantasy, in both real life and games. Being a skateboarder is a sign of what and who is cool.” He says “there’s a reason that we’re all in awe of what these people can do.” Part of what makes skateboarding cool is the music, fashion, and art, and video games let people experience that skateboarding culture, too, Tillmanns says.</p><p>Also, “it’s safer,” jokes Andrew Schimmel, a senior producer at Snowman, the creators of the <em>Skate City</em> series. He says there’s a lot of people that would probably love to try skateboarding but don’t want to risk breaking a bone. “Being able to dive into a fantasy world where you can act that out and see the gnarly consequences and not have to suffer from them is like immediately appealing.”</p><p>It helps that games take so many different approaches to skateboarding. “The skate community is so diverse, so it makes sense that there’s an appetite for all different types of games — some more realistic, some more arcade, some more casual,” says <em>Skate</em> executive producer Mike McCartney. For the new <em>Skate</em>, “it’s all about re-creating a skateboarding experience that reflects the freedom of exploration, discovery, and expression you see in skate culture. We really wanted to respect the roots of the franchise, while bringing the game forward.”</p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>games will always have what’s in the title: “They’ve got Tony Hawk, and they’ve got pro skaters,” Tillmanns says. That includes things like their styles and their personalities — even the special tricks for the skaters are a representation of their style in real life. Tony Hawk is very involved, too, even with the <em>3 + 4</em> remakes. Hawk “is where the culture comes from” and he has a “real eye for detail” about what goes in the games. “He knows that this game is the lexicon for skaters for the next few years,” according to Tillmanns.</p><p>The <em>THPS</em> series also strikes a nice mix of an arcade-y experience and a skateboarding simulation. It has generally realistic physics and locations, but also lets you pull off outlandish tricks, strive for video game-y goals (S-K-A-T-E, anyone?), and play as some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624150/rip-and-tear-and-shred">not-real characters</a> in <a href="https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Big_World">wacky places</a>. </p><p>For the <em>Skate City</em> games, the Snowman team had to think a lot about how to make skateboarding work on mobile. The first launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive, and <em>Skate City: New York</em> is currently an exclusive there, too, so the Snowman team had to figure out a mobile control scheme that “feels novel and fits the sport” that’s also approachable enough to serve a wide audience, Schimmel says. Your two thumbs represent your front and back foot, and you flick your thumbs to emulate flick tricks with skateboarding.</p><p>Developers I spoke with think there’s still a lot of ways skateboarding games can grow, too. “Skateboarding never stops evolving and neither will our game,” <em>Skate</em>’s head of creative, Jeff Seamster, says. “The creativity of skaters consistently blows my mind. The spots they find, the tricks they’re (still) inventing, the vibrant style… we couldn’t have imagined today’s scene from where we were standing 15, 10, or even five years ago. So, who knows what we’ll see tomorrow?”</p><p>“Multiplayer and online can always be the next frontier,” Tillmanns says. <em>THPS 3+4</em> will have crossplay, and the team is excited about “increasing that pool of online players to something that we’ve never seen before in a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game.”</p><p>Schimmel points to games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a> (a cartoony, side-scrolling skateboarding adventure) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7BSeOP7T64&amp;t=1s"><em>Skate Story</em></a> (a psychedelic-looking skateboarding game set to launch this year) that are highlighting skateboarding in different ways. “In terms of what hasn’t been done, I think there’s probably lots to explore,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/664363/despelote-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For a kid with an obsession, it’s impossible to think about anything else. When I was really into skateboarding, every piece of architecture was filled with a potential for tricks that I could never actually pull off. When I was on a quest to complete <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> on my own, any piece of paper became a sketch of a new level.</p><p>For eight-year-old Julián in the new game <em>Despelote</em>, that obsession is soccer, and it becomes the backdrop for a sweet, and short, slice-of-life drama about passion and memory.</p><p><em>Despelote</em> is set in Quito in 2001, just as Ecuador is on the verge of qualifying for the men’s World Cup for the first time in its history. The story follows Julián through the qualifying stages, as he goes about his life — or tries to, at least. There’s a lot going on at the time, as the country is still dealing with the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">an economic crisis</a>. Soccer becomes something of a relief valve, a hopeful story to follow during difficult times.</p><p>The game plays out from a first-person perspective and takes place across several days, during each of which Ecuador has an important match. The scenes are small but surprisingly open, often forcing young Julián – and also the player – to decide where to focus. He might be playing a 16-bit soccer game while his mom tries to lecture him, or staring out the window idly watching people kick a ball around while he’s supposed to be listening to a lesson.</p><p>Sometimes he has a goal to complete, like getting home in time for dinner or keeping an eye on his little sister in the park. But there’s always a distraction. And it’s almost always a soccer ball. Most of the time, Julián has a ball at his feet, either kicking it around with friends, or by himself while everyone else parties. When there isn’t a ball, he makes do, kicking around anything from a glass bottle to a copy of <em>Shrek</em> on DVD.</p><p>There’s a real specificity to <em>Despelote</em> in terms of its place and time, but it also evokes a very universal feeling of being a kid. Those choices between what Julián wants to do and what he is supposed to do are tough, and often his mom will let him have it when he messes up. At one point, while playing hide-and-seek, I lost his sister, and became petrified of the reaction I’d get if I didn’t find her in time. There are also moments where control is pulled away from you, and Julián’s mom will drag him by the hand wherever he’s supposed to be.</p><p>The interactivity of these moments really puts you in Julián’s shoes, and there were key scenes that brought me back to my own childhood. (Especially having a younger sibling distract you while you’re playing a video game.) It’s all rendered with dreamy, oversaturated backdrops and comic book-like characters. It feels like you’re in a memory, which is amplified by adult Julián — the game was developed by designer Julián Cordero and animator and musician Sebastián Valbuena — setting the scene through narration at the beginning of each chapter.</p><p>All the while, tension is building as Ecuador inches closer to qualification. (At most points in the game you can find your way to a TV to check the score in the current match.) It all culminates in a beautiful fourth-wall-breaking moment that puts this autobiographical story into a larger perspective.</p><p><em>Despelote </em>only lasts around two hours, and most of that time is spent kicking a ball around. And yet it manages to capture so many feelings of childhood and the all-consuming infatuations that come with being a kid.</p><p><sub>Despelote <em>is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with a Switch version also in the works.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
