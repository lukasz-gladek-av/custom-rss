The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor. That didn’t stop <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister from being impressed with the two-slot RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU when he stuffed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">into his aging small-form-factor PC</a>. </p><p>Along with the 50-series GPUs comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a>, a software trick that may be just as big a story as the hardware itself. This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on. Gamers who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">already trying DLSS 4 out</a> in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>using RTX 40-series GPUs report seeing huge improvements already.</p><p>We’ll be keeping up with all the news about Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs right here at <em>The Verge</em>.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-caa3630a-bcdb-467c-b368-1a677ad29fb9"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-91bd7a43-471e-47c8-89f2-39e7d6f43bba"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5cd0eaef-1c6f-4ba4-b197-57c89fe8f67d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.) </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e35ff62d-24fc-46ff-b09f-4328dfb9ee93"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b2e686c1-44f6-4156-a308-5b38f054bd07"><div><p>The RTX 5090 might be in short supply.</p><p>Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 5090 launch on January 30th might be met with limited stock, according to some system builders and retailers.

Just like our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">first look at the RTX 5090</a>, this isn’t a review. Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-809426f9-6ed6-4859-a840-6eafd15ecc03"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5ab3ae1e-44d8-4375-bf8a-80be65493fd9"><div><p>We finally played with an RTX 5090.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean</a> has been scouring CES for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090</a> demo with an actually playable game.

It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,599 RTX 4090? The answer is yes and no, and it all comes down to a “fake frames” argument about DLSS Frame Generation that might not even be a big problem for a lot of PC gamers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-854f6bad-66b8-48c6-a138-a8432971a01c"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-862bd3ec-0b20-4562-9f56-1e6b976fbbc8"><div><p>Nvidia’s China-only RTX 5090D slashes AI performance.</p><p>The China-only chip comes with 2,375 AI TOPS, compared to the 3,352&nbsp;on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090 that will launch elsewhere</a>, as pointed out by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921131/us-china-restrictions-ai-chip-sales-nvidia">US export rules</a> prevent chipmakers like Nvidia from selling high-powered chips to China.</p><p>Despite these requirements, it seems some of the company’s advanced chips have made their way into China through smuggling,<em> </em>according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-prompts-nvidia-supermicro-probe-into-how-chips-ended-up-in-china">to<em> The Information</em></a><em>.</em></p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cf4049a3-cf26-4a8b-ae22-c996ba55f17d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Nvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a></h2><p>Nvidia is revealing a big upgrade to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology today. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F">DLSS 4</a> will include new neural rendering capabilities that, on systems with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">the new RTX 50 Series GPUs</a>, can do Multi Frame Generation, generating “up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering.”</p><p>According to Nvidia, that’s a big enough upgrade to make 4K 240fps, fully ray-traced gaming possible.

Whether they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release">pushing the boundaries of the medium</a> and or offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">a creative spin on classic ideas</a>, indie games can be just as interesting as big-budget epics.</p><p>Sometimes, though, indie games can fly under the radar. But we here at <em>The Verge</em> love seeking out hidden gems, so we want to use this space to share some of our favorite smaller games that we’re checking out so that you might find something new, or potentially your next obsession.</p><p>We’ll be highlighting interesting games you may not have heard of and sharing a little bit about why you should play them. This list will be updated pretty frequently, too — so check back often to see some new recommendations. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-536262cb-a0dd-424e-b4ed-acbc0477d41f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Lok Digital is a surreal puzzle game full of made-up words</a></h2><p>At a glance, <a href="https://lok-digital.com/"><em>Lok Digital</em></a> seems like another cute and clever word game, a perfect distraction to keep on your phone for idle moments. But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e887dbd2-3c1e-4d9f-b3e5-a1e680b6e5d9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Antonblast is an out-of-control platformer with its heart in the ’90s</a></h2><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon. It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-0e685471-7967-498d-a4ed-3c7d132ba74e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">The best mobile skateboarding game now has a New York sequel</a></h2><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>.

That’s according to Developer Second Dinner, which <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882957014898454727">announced yesterday</a> it was starting the process of restoring the game to Google’s Android app store at 6PM PT / 3PM ET that day. The developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882905320001089938">said in another post</a> it expects the game to return to both Google’s and Apple’s app stores “as early as next week.” </p><p><em>Marvel Snap </em>was caught up in the TikTok outage last weekend because its original publisher, Nuverse, is owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance. The game came <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348353/marvel-snap-tiktok-ban-back-online">back online for players</a> on Monday and <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">Second Dinner said</a> it planned to “bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.” As of now, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still “provided, operated, and managed by Nuverse,” according to the <a href="https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/Snap/snap_privacy_policy_en.html">privacy policy</a> on the game’s website.</p><p>An admin of the <a href="https://discord.com/servers/marvel-snap-978545345715908668"><em>Marvel Snap</em> Discord server</a> also announced a set of compensation packages for players affected by the outage. As seen in screenshots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i99zmp/compensation_galore/">posted to Reddit</a>, that includes in-game credits, tokens, and special variants for accounts that were created in the US or that showed US activity in the 30 days prior to the outage. Non-US players will also get a “Global Gratitude Package” with similar, though fewer, benefits. </p><p>Other apps that went down last weekend, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348629/capcut-back-online-us-tiktok-bytedance">such as CapCut</a> and Lemon8, have since come back online but still aren’t listed in the iOS and Android app stores. Although President Donald Trump has directed the US Attorney General <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">not to enforce the US TikTok ban</a>, it’s unclear whether he can shield Apple or Google from legal liability if they host the apps in defiance of the law.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p>It sounds kind of weird at first, and that feeling is only exacerbated by the dictionary of words you’re working with. They are gibberish. The game eases you into this fictional language, though, slowly introducing new words that each add a new wrinkle to the puzzles. The word “Lok,” for instance, lets you black out any square on the board, while “Be” lets you write the letter of your choice on a blank square. As your selection of words grows, so do the techniques at your disposal.</p><p>Here’s a GIF that gives an idea of how it plays out:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Letibus Design and Icedrop Games</cite></p></div><p>I didn’t quite understand it at first, but <em>Lok</em> really clicked for me when I stopped thinking of it like other word games, such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23037899/knotwords-wordle-crossword-puzzle-game-zach-gage-iphone-android-pc"><em>Knotwords</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>Wordle</em></a>. It’s a puzzle game, just one where certain combinations of letters are used to solve problems. You don’t need to think of the best words you know; you need to use the existing ones in clever ways to clear out every square. It feels immensely satisfying when you discover the right way to chain together gibberish to solve a puzzle. And while it can be difficult, the game does a great job of easing you along. It ramps up slowly, has a helpful hint system, and also provides an easy-to-reference list of all the words you’ve uncovered so far.</p><p>As a puzzler, <em>Lok</em> really nails the balance of challenge and scale, giving you bite-sized problems that still feel good to solve. It’s perfect for mobile where you might only have a few minutes to play (though the game is also available on PC and was <a href="https://www.blazgracar.com/lok">originally a physical puzzle book</a>). But it also goes a step further in creating an extremely chill vibe, with its lo-fi soundtrack and cozy monochrome visuals. It really does feel like you’re dropping into an alien world — one where you have to discover a whole new language to make it through.</p><p><small>Lok Digital <em>is available now on iOS, Android, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Keeping your laptop cool while gaming doesn’t just improve its performance; it also prolongs the life of its components and helps avoid <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/What_to_do_with_a_swollen_battery">battery bloat</a>, an affliction that becomes more common with age. Razer says its $150 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-laptop-cooling-pad">Laptop Cooling Pad</a> works with laptops of any size and will lower CPU and GPU temperatures by up to 18 percent. (It also, naturally, has an RGB strip.)</p><p>With some Razer gaming laptops, it can go even further. When the cooling pad is connected via USB to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">2023</a> or 2024 Razer Blade 16, a feature called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">Hyperboost</a> automatically adjusts fan speed and cooling mode and lets the laptop allocate up to 20 extra watts each to the CPU and GPU. (Razer is bringing Hyperboost to more models over the coming months.)</p><p>I’ve played around with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad for the last few weeks, both before and after the Hyperboost update. And while it isn’t quite as impressive as Razer claims, I did notice a significant improvement in 1080p performance in games that were previously held back by a lack of power to the CPU.</p><p>I tested the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with a top-of-the-line 2024 Razer Blade 16 with a mobile Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card and Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, as well as with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (AMD version)</a>. It’s possible to cycle through preset fan speeds and RGB lighting configurations using buttons on the side, but fine control requires installing Razer Synapse, which might be a deal-breaker for some people even if the price isn’t.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hello, Synapse, my old acquaintance.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Razer’s cooling pad gets <em>loud</em>. With the 140mm fan spinning full bore, I measured <a href="https://www.iacacoustics.com/blog-full/comparative-examples-of-noise-levels">62 decibels</a> right next to the laptop and about 56 to 58 decibels in what I would consider a realistic gaming position. (My apartment has a noise floor of about 40 decibels.) It’s not ear-splitting, but the fan’s constant volume and mechanical timbre are distracting — it sounds close enough to a vacuum cleaner to startle my cat. For comparison, the built-in fans on both laptops I tested output at less than 50 decibels using their Turbo power profiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Razer’s quest to create a laptop cooling pad that can fit any device also means that it’s large by necessity. Not only does it take up more space on the desk than your laptop alone but it also requires external power and uses a bulky adapter that crowds out the plug next to it on the power strip. It comes with three different top plates that snap to the pad magnetically. The plate for laptops from 14 to 16 inches and the one for 18-inch laptops use memory foam strips to create an airtight seal between the fan chamber and the intake vents at the bottom of the laptop. The third, for fanless or ventless devices like the MacBook Air, is totally flat. The back boasts three USB-A 2.0 ports that remain accessible no matter the size of the laptop on top.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Three USB 2.0 ports mean you can keep your mouse and keyboard plugged into the cooling pad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s a good thing that Hyperboost works, at least in certain circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nVfKMjUFQc">In his review of the 2024 Razer Blade 16</a>, YouTuber Jarrod’sTech noted that both it and the 2023 model underperform at 1080p. That’s because, by default, they allocate more of their total power allowance to the GPU, but at lower resolutions, most games are held back by the CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperboost blows past that. With more power to the CPU, the 2024 Blade 16 put out 123 frames per second in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1080p with every setting maxed out (except ray tracing), compared to the 90fps I measured without Hyperboost. <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> was similar: at 1080p max settings, I measured 204fps with Hyperboost on and 185 with it disabled.</p><div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates</p></div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates; the GPU becomes the limiting factor, and pumping more power into it grants diminishing returns. At the Blade 16’s native 1600p resolution (and above, if you’re using an external monitor), I measured about the same frame rate with or without Hyperboost, give or take a frame or two. Temperatures are still noticeably lower, with the power-hungry Intel Core i9-14900HX staying below 90 degrees Celsius and the RTX 4090 keeping under 70 degrees under torture testing, but the 2024 Blade 16 already had a great cooling system thanks to its thickness. Thermal throttling was never a concern.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can use the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with any laptop. Nobody can stop you.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Razer Laptop Cooling Pad will do a good job of cooling non-Razer gaming laptops, too — with or without Synapse. It prevented the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor inside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a> from reaching its 95 degrees Celsius ceiling when benchmarking, which it usually hits quite fast. Even the strip above the keyboard, which often hits 115 degrees Fahrenheit, topped out at a comparatively balmy 90 degrees under full load.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a statistically significant frame rate improvement in games or synthetic tests on the ROG Zephyrus G16 — even after taking advantage of the thermal headroom to overclock the CPU and GPU. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Pictured: one of the very few laptops that work with Hyperboost.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Therein lies the biggest problem with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad. It certainly pushes air around, but only people with a Hyperboost-compatible Razer Blade 16 — a <em>very</em> small segment of the overall gaming population — will see a difference in performance, and even then, only in CPU-limited games. </p><p>Of course, it’s possible that Hyperboost will make more of a difference in other Razer laptops, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">the slimmer Blade 16 that Razer announced at CES</a> the same day it released Hyperboost. The new Blade is about as thick as the ROG Zephyrus G16, which uses drastic power and temperature limits to keep heat under control in its slim chassis. Maybe the new Blade 16 will manage the heat just fine, like the 2024 model, but perhaps the timing isn’t entirely coincidental.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/1ftiwce/new_razer_cooling_pad_150_usd_thoughts/">Reddit users</a> have pointed out, Razer’s $150 cooling pad has a lot in common with similar cooling stands from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/llano-External-Computer-15-6-21in-Adjustable/dp/B0CMTCB8Q6/?tag=theverge02-20">Llano</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IETS-Equipped-Turbo-Fan%EF%BC%885-5inch-Diameter%EF%BC%89-14-1-19-3/dp/B0CDC3XW44/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">IETS</a>: all require external power, use an adjustable-speed 140mm fan, have RGB and a USB hub, and seal to the laptop with memory foam, but the Llano and IETS coolers cost closer to $100. Many of them even have adjustable tilt levels, which the Razer cooling pad lacks. We haven’t tested them, but unless you have a compatible Razer Blade or <em>really</em> want the RGB lights on your laptop cooling pad to sync with Chroma, something more basic will work just as well for $50 less.</p><p><em>Photography by Jonathan Hilburg for </em>The Verge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
