            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662579/team-lfg-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/">just announced</a> a new internal studio called Team LFG, which will be developing “a team-based action game.” According to Sony Interactive Entertainment studios CEO Hermen Hulst, the studio “originated at Bungie, but has also rallied developers from across the industry to bring to life an ambitious incubation project that I’m very excited about.”</p><p>Curiously, no specific developers were announced as part of the studio reveal, so it’s not clear who is actually working at Team LFG. As part of the post introducing the studio, it’s described as “a team composed not just of industry veterans who have shipped titles like <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>League of Legend</em>s, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Rec Room</em>, but also industry newcomers with fresh creative perspectives and skills.“</p><div><p>The existence of Team LFG is part of PlayStation’s push into live service games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">which has been scaled back</a> from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914016/sony-playstation-live-service-games-launch-march-2026">its original ambitious plan</a>, and has suffered a series of major setbacks.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/15/23220335/bungie-sony-acquisition-complete-official-done">Sony originally acquired <em>Destiny</em> developer Bungie in 2022</a>, and the studio went through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938990/bungie-sony-layoffs-delays-destiny-final-shape-marathon">multiple rounds</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">of layoffs</a> in the following years. When announcing layoffs in 2024, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said that “we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development,” which appears to be Team LFG. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">Bungie is currently working on a multiplayer shooter called <em>Marathon</em></a>.</p></div><div><p>Sony also released the hero shooter <em>Concord</em> in 2024, and the launch was so disastrous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">the game was taken offline</a> and, eventually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">its developer Firewalk Studios was shuttered</a>.</p></div><p>It’s not clear how far into development Team LFG’s first release is, nor when it might be properly announced. The studio says that “we will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours” and that its first game “draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games.” The studio adds that “players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
