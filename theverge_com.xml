            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p>I would have been disappointed if Nintendo messed with what worked for the Switch with the Switch 2. I’m glad it has a bigger screen, one that appears to be even larger than the seven-inch display on the OLED Switch. I’m guessing the taller Joy-Cons will be easier to hold, which could be a massive improvement for my hands, and attaching them from the side looks like it could be easier than sliding them up and down. The second USB-C port on the top will be a <em>very</em> welcome addition for easier charging. And even though I barely used it, the return of the kickstand is great, too — maybe with the Switch 2, I’ll actually bring it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13403924/nintendo-switch-karen-meme-reveal-video">some rooftop parties</a>.</p><p>I also quite like the new black design with accent colors. Sure, it doesn’t pop quite as much as the red and blue Joy-Cons for the original Switch, but I think this design looks elegant with a splash of Nintendo whimsy — I love how colors peek out in different places around the hardware. And there will almost certainly be more color options at launch; Nintendo initially revealed the Switch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161020005938/en/Nintendo-Switch-World-Premiere-Demonstrates-New-Entertainment-Experiences-from-a-Home-Gaming-System">in gray</a> and later showed off the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/170113.html">now-iconic red and blue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo made a great call in making physical <em>and</em> digital Switch games backward-compatible with the Switch 2. (Before today, it was a little unclear if that would be the case.) I’ve spent years building up a large digital Switch library that is filled with incredible games, and while Nintendo says that “certain” games won’t be supported on its new console, I imagine that the vast majority of my favorite Switch games will be playable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nintendo didn’t reveal any technical specs, we can presume it’s going to be more powerful than the original Switch. And hopefully the new console gives a boost to games that sometimes struggled on the original hardware — as much as I love <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, some performance improvements could make it even better. The same goes for other big games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Maybe we’ll finally get a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game on the Switch now.</p><p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2. The only official Switch 2 game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Nintendo didn’t reveal the console’s UI or say if the console has any improved online features. The video briefly showed a way to use the Joy-Con like a computer mouse, but that could be a barely used gimmick. We don’t know how much it will cost or when in 2025 it will come out.</p><p>That said, because it builds upon the original Switch’s outstanding legacy, it will be a familiar experience. There will be lots of older games to play even if Nintendo doesn’t have many Switch 2 games from the jump. It doesn’t look like Nintendo has switched things up very much — and that’s fine with me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345133/sony-until-dawn-movie-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Sony has been saying that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">upcoming <em>Until Dawn</em> feature</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show=PlayStation">one of its new IP adaptations</a> — is meant to channel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">the game’s spirit</a>. But the movie’s latest trailer makes it pretty clear that this isn’t just going to be a one-to-one translation.</p></div><p>Similar to the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/16/world-premiere-of-the-until-dawn-movie-trailer/">director David F. Sandberg’s <em>Until Dawn</em></a><em> </em>revolves around a group of people who find themselves trapped in a time loop that resets as they’re each murdered in a number of different horrific scenarios. When Melanie (Maia Mitchell) goes missing under mysterious circumstances, her younger sister Clover (Ella Rubin) recruits her friends Max (Michael Cimino), Megan (Ji-young Yoo), Nina (Odessa A’zion), and Abel (Belmont Cameli) on a mission to find her. In the trailer, group’s search brings them to what looks to be an inn run by Hill (Peter Stormare), an odd man who warns them that wandering farther up the road will only bring trouble into their lives.</p><p>Though one seems all that bothered by how the weather acts strangely around Hill’s inn, they know something is up when their car vanishes, and they find Melanie’s signature written in a dusty old guest log. Things only get spookier as night falls, and <em>something </em>starts lurking in the darkness around Clover and her friends. But it isn’t until people start dying that they realize they’re somehow being resurrected and challenged to survive until the morning as various ghouls try to kill them in inventive ways. </p><p>The trailer makes it seem like, despite revolving around new characters, it’ll hit many of the classic <em>Until Dawn </em>beats<em>. </em>And when the movie hits theaters on April 25th, it’ll probably keep audiences guessing as to who exactly is going to make it out alive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
