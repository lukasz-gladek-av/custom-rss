They each feature a boatload of ports and will start at $1,899.99 for the 16-inch and $2,199.99 for the 18-inch. The 16 launches in the US in April (other countries in May), and the 18 launches in May (other countries in June).</p><p>Both laptops feature RGB logos on their lids, four-zone keyboard lighting, and up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Also in the high-end configs is a 240Hz 2560 x 1600 OLED for the 16-inch model and 250Hz Mini LED of the same resolution for the 18-inch. Both sizes of laptop feature 90Wh batteries and Wi-Fi 6E support. Each model comes standard with enough ports to keep you free and clear of dongle town. There’s one Thunderbolt 4 port, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, <em>three </em>USB-A ports, one HDMI 2.1, a 3.5mm headphone / mic combo jack, and even an ethernet port. Oddly, for such large and thick laptops, they’ve got microSD card slots instead of full-size. That seems like the only thing “micro” about these laptops weighing as much as 7.28 pounds.</p><p>But the bigger thing to be aware of is that the RTX 5070 Ti GPUs, Core Ultra 9 CPUs, and OLED / Mini LED screens are all optional. At the starting configurations for both sizes you’re getting a more modest Core Ultra 7 255HX and RTX 5070. That doesn’t sound terrible, but the base-model displays are just 1920 x 1200.</p><p>We reached out to Acer about the cost of the higher-end Predator Helios Neo configurations, but did not hear back before publication.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
