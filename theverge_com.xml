Developed by The Coalition, <em>E-Day</em> will release in a year that marks 20 years since the original <em>Gears of War</em> game debuted on the Xbox 360, and 25 years of Xbox.</p><p><em>E-Day</em> is set 14 years before the first <em>Gears</em> game, and “tells the story of the first Locust emergence on Sera.” It’s being billed as an origin story, and once again stars Marcus Fenix. <em>E-Day</em> is the first title in the series since <em>Gears 5</em> debuted in 2019.</p><p>Last month, Microsoft also announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661169/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-release-date"><em>Gears of War </em>remaster</a> that also brings the franchise to PlayStation for the first time. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is launching on August 26th for Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation, and PC for $39.99. The remaster features 4K resolution, 120fps support, and cross-progression and cross-play for all platforms. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will also have two-player co-op for the campaign and 8-player multiplayer.</p><p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed the <em>E-Day</em> release window during the Xbox Games Showcase earlier today, and also revealed “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming in 2026 too, as well as “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” That classic may well be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024"><em>Halo CE</em> remaster I wrote about last year</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
