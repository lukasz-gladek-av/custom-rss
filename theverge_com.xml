Stats shared by the gaming software giant on Wednesday show the drop-off rate for Epic Games Store installations on iOS has gone from 65 percent down to around 25 percent following the release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alt-distribution-ux-in-the-eu/">iOS 18.6</a> in July.</p><p>The “updated user experience” for installing alternative app marketplaces was introduced in iOS 18.6 following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636196/apple-eu-dma-probe-alternative-app-stores-tax">EU commission raising concerns in April</a> that “Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative app distribution channels.”</p><p>“They’ve reduced the install flow from 15 steps to 6, eliminating their former scare screen and its misleading message, and eliminated a dead-end that left the user stranded in iOS Settings,” said Epic. “For the first time, we are starting to see iOS users install the Epic Games Store with a success rate approaching Windows users and Apple’s own Mac users.”</p><p>Epic says there are still improvements to be made, however, alleging that Apple’s anticompetitive behavior towards third-party app stores continues to violate the DMA, and is pushing developers to distribute fewer games through the Epic Games Store on iOS compared to Android. Epic also called out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">Google’s 12-step installation process</a> on Android, saying its “deceptive user interface sabotages Epic Games Store install attempts on Android” more than 50 percent of the time.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789421/epic-games-store-ios-android-installations]]></content:encoded>
