Several years ago the company removed several games, including <em>Phantasy Star Classics,</em> from the Google Play and iOS app stores, and it’s expected that these nine will also eventually be removed, although Sega hasn’t specified when that will happen. However, any games that have already been downloaded and installed on a tablet or mobile device can still be played even after they’re delisted.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
