A new console means a new generation of games like <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>and the franchise’s next mainline title. But there should also be some major updates for more casual games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/601656/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-functionality-issues">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23893260/pokemon-sleep-insomnia-app-nintendo-aid">Pokémon Sleep</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615045/niantic-rumored-to-be-discussing-3-5-billion-sale-of-pok">Pokémon Go</a></em>. We’ve already gotten a little (animated) taste of what Nintendo has been cooking up, but there are even more reveals in store, which you can follow along with right here.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE4NzA1">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s starters make their debut in new trailer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjIwMTk2">Pokémon Champions gets right to the fights</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/618678/pokemon-presents-2025-all-the-biggest-news-and-trailers#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE4ODg3">Kick off Pokémon Day 2025 with this gorgeous short film</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Pokémon Unite is leveling up with Alola’s coolest monster.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports">Pokémon Unite</a> </em>has been teasing Suicune’s addition to its roster for a little while now, but this year’s Pokémon Presents showcase, The Pokémon Company revealed that the Gen II legendary isn’t the only heave hitter coming to the game. Following Suicune’s debut on March 1st, <em>Pokémon Unite </em>will add Alolan Raichu (arguably <em>the </em>sickest pokémon to date) in April, and Alcremie (a monster made of berries and cream) some time later this year.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE4NzA1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s starters make their debut in new trailer</a></h2><div><p>Like its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> </em>is bringing back three classic starter pokémon to get you started on your next adventure.</p><p>Though <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>will likely introduce a number of new creatures, Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the first three partner pokémon you can choose between as you journey into the depths of Lumiose City. The starters were the stars of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>teaser The Pokémon Company debuted during this year’s Pokémon Presents. Details about the game are still sparse, but we now know a little bit more about how its battles will work.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjIwMTk2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile">Pokémon Champions gets right to the fights</a></h2><div><p>To celebrate the day when Pikachu pika’d his way into our hearts and minds almost <em>30 years ago</em>, The Pokémon Company held a Pokémon Presents showcase highlighting what games and experiences to expect in the coming months. There were updates on <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, a new season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a totally new multiplayer gameplay: <em>Pokémon Champions</em>.</p><p>While the reveal was light on the specifics,<em> Champions</em> appears to a game focused solely on battling. Players will be able to import their pokémon from <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> or <em>Violet</em>, Pokémon Home, and other games into<em> Champions</em> to use in battles against players around the world. There are restrictions, however, on the pokémon you can use. The fine print says that not every pokémon available in Home and elsewhere will be available in <em>Champions</em> and those obtained in <em>Champions</em> cannot be ported back to Home.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620196/pokemon-champions-online-pokemon-battles-nintendo-switch-mobile">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s almost pokémon time.</p><p>The annual Pokémon Presents showcase is happening at 9AM ET this morning, and with games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Legends: Z-A</a></em> in the works, not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a brand-new Switch on the way</a>, we’re expecting a good showing.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE4ODg3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618887/dragonite-and-the-special-delivery-pokemon-day-2025">Kick off Pokémon Day 2025 with this gorgeous short film</a></h2><div><p>It’s technically already Pokémon Day in Japan, and while we’re still a few hours away from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616289/pokemon-presents">this year’s big Pokémon Presents showcase</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/617216/oh-yes-wait-a-minute-mr-postmon">a new animated short film</a> out that right now feels like the perfect way to get pumped up for whatever surprises Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Many of the Pokémon Company’s animated projects outside of the mainline anime have been fun explorations of what people and their pokémon get up to besides battling. But director Maho Aoki’s <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery</em> also feels like a reminder to thank your mail carriers for all the hard work they do.
