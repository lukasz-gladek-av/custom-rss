The game, set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe, launched in early access on PC <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-early-access-starts-october-7/">in October</a> and hit consoles <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-is-coming-to-console-january-20/">just a few weeks ago</a>.</p><p><em>2XKO</em> has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename <em>Project L</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview">in 2019</a> as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond <em>League of Legends</em>. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">Netflix’s animated series <em>Arcane</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915322/riot-project-a-tactical-shooter-league-of-legends">tactical shooter</a> that would eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265402/valorant-riot-shooter-launch-date">become <em>Valorant</em></a>, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">as part of layoffs</a> affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for <em>2XKO</em> also reflect an increasingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">competitive market</a> for live service games that has even proved difficult <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">for Sony to overcome</a>.</p><p>“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”</p><p>The cuts “affect roughly 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team,” Riot spokesperson Brian Chui tells <em>The Verge</em>. Affected staffers will be given assistance finding new jobs internally at Riot and, where that’s not possible, 6 months of notice pay and severance, Cannon says.</p><p>“Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” according to Cannon. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, February 9th</strong>: Added details from a Riot spokesperson about the cuts.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/876038/riot-games-2xko-layoffs-job-cuts-league-of-legends]]></content:encoded>
