It’s playable solo and multiplayer, where your Meta avatar represents you in a match. Meta says the game can adapt to your play space, but it also uses the Quest boundaryless mode for those with access to wide-open spaces. </p><p>A blatant knockoff of Nintendo’s <em>Sports </em>series<em> </em>it may be, but I’m not mad.</p><p>It’ll be hard to replicate the crucial component of a group of people holding Wii remotes and watching each other fail at bowling. However, this could be a good time, assuming that developer Revolution Games otherwise got the feel right and you have enough headsets to go around. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can usually find great deals on gaming accessories, too, from controllers and headsets to expanded storage for consoles like the Xbox Series X / S. </p><p>We’ve combed through all of the early Black Friday gaming deals to bring together the best of the bunch in one convenient spot<em>. </em>Tons of games are discounted right now, as we’re seeing the lowest prices to date on recent hits like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q/?tag=theverge02-20"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> and <a href="https://howl.link/e1fua03dhgpwh"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. You can also find discounts on lesser-known gems like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2FY9H73?tag=theverge02-20"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, which is on sale for $40 in one of its first major sales. </p><div><p>Hardware discounts can be rare, but there are sizable savings to be had across the board, whether you’re after a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-1TB-Digital-Edition-Robot-White-Wireless-Controller-Includes-2-Controllers-Up-120-frames-per-second-16-GB-RAM-Memory-1-TB-SSD-Storage-E%2F13244064652">Xbox Series X</a>, a <a href="https://howl.link/txqo13bekf7uh?u1=vergebfsales2024">Nintendo Switch</a>, or even a Steam Deck alternative like the <a href="https://howl.link/qg3p8njgieaii">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. You can also save a good chunk on accessories like the excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWKD9TF?tag=theverge02-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset</a>, get a <a href="https://howl.link/omm6z5optv67g">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a> for $50, and score some of the best prices yet on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW/?tag=theverge02-20">2TB SSDs for Xbox consoles</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Officially-Licensed-Expansion/dp/B0C47ZX1WB?tag=theverge02-20">PS5</a>.</p></div><p><h3>The best video game deals</h3></p><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is the latest from the creators of the <em>Persona </em>series, which is easy to tell based on its cell-shaded art style. The heavy-hitting story is less noticeable, though, and there’s a lot to unpack as you play through the medieval-era, turn-based RPG.</p></div><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>is the culmination of everything Remedy Entertainment has been building toward. The inventive third-person survival game is both horrifying and strange, with dual campaigns that are more than a little meta.</p></div><div><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is the latest installment in the <em>Zelda </em>franchise. The storyline and gameplay are similar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s<em>, </em>but enough has changed to make Link’s return to Hyrule plenty special. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><ul><li><em><strong>NBA 2K25</strong></em> is down to an all-time low of $29.99 ($40 off) at Amazon for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96QNZWH?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96RBDVX?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Series X / S</a>. That deal is timely for those currently enjoying the first quarter of the pro basketball season. Overall, the simulation dribbler will feel familiar to longtime series vets, but among other key tweaks, MyPlayer’s improved Neighborhood experience cuts back on required travel, and you’ll no longer lose badge levels while taking extended breaks from the game.  </li><li>You can get a PS5 copy of <em><strong>Madden NFL 25</strong></em> for $25 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/35t1wbn2gl04n">Best Buy</a>, which is the lowest price we’ve seen so far. The <a href="https://howl.link/zyqqd2r4bekc3">Series X / S version</a> is also on sale for $29.99 ($40 off). The latest in the beloved football series features multiple commentary teams for the first time, a new presentation with an improved lighting engine, and physics-based tackling and movement.</li><li><em><strong>Bluey: The Videogame</strong></em> is on sale at Amazon for a record low of around $19.99 (50 percent off) at Amazon for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Videogame-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CJ3GM2MQ?tag=theverge02-20">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Videogame-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CJ3DPYGV?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Series X / S</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Videogame-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CJ3GM5CS?tag=theverge02-20">Nintendo Switch</a>. Based on the animated show, <em>Bluey</em> is a game the whole family can enjoy thanks to co-op play that puts you in control of the titular character and her loving family members, Chilli, Bingo, and Bandit.</li></ul></div><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p><em>Elden Ring, </em>the latest FromSoftware title, takes the&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>&nbsp;formula to a vast open world. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p>A remastered collection of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, and the two original <em>Metal Gear </em>titles from the MSX2.

The refreshing title features gorgeous environments and wildly inventive mechanics, many of which turn tried-and-true platforming mechanics on their head.

The excellent 3D platformer offers plenty of twists and charm on the classic Mario formula, mostly due to a new mechanic (read: a hat) that lets Nintendo’s iconic mascot possess a variety of objects and characters. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><p><h3>The best console deals </h3></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online, saving you an additional $79.98 when it’s not on sale.</p></div><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>The Xbox Series X is Microsoft’s flagship console, serving as its most powerful (and biggest) option focused on fast, 4K gameplay. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><ul><li>The <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> is down to $249 ($50 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/pmughxsuescct">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-512gb%2F-%2FA-93578803%2F">Target</a>. It’s the most affordable option in Microsoft’s latest console generation, namely because it features less processing power and caps gaming at 1440p resolution. It also lacks a disc drive and only has 512GB of storage instead of 1TB.

The handheld lets you play PC games on the go thanks to its seven-inch 1080p display, and while there are faster alternatives, it’s still serviceable for esports shooters, indie gems, and other lightweight titles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li>You can also get the <strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong> with 512GB of storage for around $499 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Legion-Handheld-Touchscreen-Extreme/dp/B0CM74YFSP?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/3unamwbj07l88">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/handheld/legion-go/len106g0001">Lenovo’s site</a> (you can get a 1TB model for $549.99 at <a href="https://howl.link/q5ghzc8k7ofh7">Best Buy</a>, too).
