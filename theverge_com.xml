Considering this is my first game, I’m extremely proud of everything I managed to include for launch, but there are a few minor things that were not quite completed before our release date that I feel must be added to fulfill that original vision.”</p><p>Here’s what you can expect in that 1.10 update, according to Ros:</p><div><blockquote><p>Among the planned inclusions in this final update: an overhyped arcade game, a curious house cat, accessibility features like color assist mode, controls remapping, cursor size/opacity settings, and widescreen support. Some UI/UX improvements, more variations for end-of-day manor descriptions and accompanying house illustrations, HUD display customization, final room/item balancing, and the addition of a handful of extra cinematics that I am still working on (the unlockable challenge modes actually have their own unique openings and endings!)</p></blockquote></div><p>However, Ros notes that there will be bug-fixing patches released “intermittently” in the “months leading up to 1.10.” Ros says that some updates may include some of the features listed for 1.1o: “we wouldn’t want to sit on accessibility features for months on end while we wait on cinematics!” And Ros says the team will be “continually” committed to fixing bugs “for far, far into the future.”</p><p>Update 1.04.5 is out on Steam now and is expected to be available on PS5 and Xbox “before the weekend.” On PS5, it includes a fix for a save rollback issue.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 22nd</strong>: Clarified 1.04.5’s release timing on PS5 and Xbox.</em></p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
