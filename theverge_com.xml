On top of your monthly subscription and the cost of the <em>Midnight</em> expansion itself, some Housing items will require a new in-game currency called “Hearthsteel” that players will have to pay for with real money. <em>World of Warcraft</em> already has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-has-a-currency-problem-more-than-500-kinds-of-tender-can-currently-be-used-in-the-20-year-old-game/">hundreds of currencies</a>, and at one point, the game’s main currency, gold, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/world/world-of-warcraft-token-worth-more-than-venezuelas-currency-trnd">worth more than the Venezuelan bolivar</a>.</p><p>Blizzard said in its <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight">announcement blog post</a> for Hearthsteel that it will only be for Housing, not the Trading Post, mounts, or other in-game items. Blizzard also clarified that not all of the Housing items will require Hearthsteel:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The vast majority of Housing items are (and will continue to be) earnable in-game. Only a small fraction is available for purchase from the shop. Comparing this number against collectibles such as mounts is a good metric here, with more than a thousand mounts earnable in-game and only a few dozen from the shop.”</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816714/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-hearthsteel-currency]]></content:encoded>
