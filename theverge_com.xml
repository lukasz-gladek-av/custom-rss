            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>MicroSD cards are tiny but slow; the M.2 storage sticks in your PC are blazing fast but bigger and fully enclosed. Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.</p><p>Chinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4x2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.</p><p>To put that in context, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2</a> top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation.</p><p>The nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Type</h3></th><th><h3>Length</h3></th><th><h3>Width</h3></th><th><h3>Height</h3></th><th><h3>Theoretical max speed</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mini SSD</td><td>15mm</td><td>17mm</td><td>1.4mm</td><td>3,700MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>MicroSD</td><td>11mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>1mm</td><td>985MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>24mm</td><td>32mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>3,940MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2230</td><td>22mm</td><td>30mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~8,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2280</td><td>22mm</td><td>80mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~14,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Nano-SIM</td><td>8.8mm</td><td>12.3mm</td><td>0.67mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Micro-SIM</td><td>12mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Mini-SIM</td><td>15mm</td><td>25mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But <a href="https://www.biwintechnology.com/press-release/biwin-mini-ssd/">the company’s marketing it</a> for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.</p><p>The company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.</p><p>Two cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714294/gpd-win-5-strix-halo-specs-revealed">the GPD Win 5</a>, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story.</p><div><p>OneNetbook’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYmUXOap4U">upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet</a>, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card]]></content:encoded>

The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is the new flagship at $299.99. It uses 53mm drivers and 2.4GHz wireless lasting up to 250 hours — an impressive 10+ days of continuous use — though it drops to half that when simultaneously connected to Bluetooth. Its showiest feature is its included base station, with six customizable light-up buttons and a big old rotary volume knob.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>Those colorful buttons look fun to press.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: HyperX</cite></span></p></section><p>There’s also a cheaper Cloud Flight 2 with RGB side panels that will cost $129.99 for PlayStation / PC or $139.99 for Xbox. For mics, there’s the $59.99 SoloCast 2 side-address desktop mic and $229.99 HyperX FlipCast “broadcast quality” podcast / streaming mic. The FlipCast looks a bit like Shure’s MV7 mic with RGB lighting. And like an MV7, it has both USB and XLR ports.</p><p>The new headsets and mics are due out this month, except the Cloud Flight 2 which is expected in October.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.
