Buying a microSD Express card gives you more storage, though at a higher cost than most people likely want to pay. However, <strong>Lexar’s 512GB and 1TB microSD Express cards</strong> are currently selling at the lowest prices we’ve seen yet.</p><p>The 512GB model is $88.47 ($31 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSD-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0512G-BNNNU/dp/B0DYBW1MNC/ref=sr_1_4?crid=33EQD1TTA66MB&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.k1QsShijZU0-0nNMo-n2hLQ_J6pTr9Jpyf3IlLGlAZlpcy0aX4a6ak7w2zE2isABp58PsOJNeazBF1CJQvvkvgFX1dyFYWBxcxLi6Cii4dacv1B5sTUO4M0fvhA2mVVFAtd58ShjVODJX8juvg-JcXqZJ7DXsmNysy_GIowJhfWWN553kGvI-d-qEtKri_HdnmuslOHiVzXH8cd_eExRUKXkKwtPei_FCWPDjnvYLZY.T6y59F5XDrKNdsUJ6R8sxCwl7pEpSb4cEAcRscsVL1k&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=lexar%2Bmicrosd%2Bcard&amp;qid=1760024724&amp;sprefix=lexar%2Bmicrosd%2Bcard%2Caps%2C211&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, or double the extra storage to 1TB for $157.96 ($62 off), also at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSD-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. That’s only a little more expensive than a <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">comparable cards</a> from Onn, Walmart’s house brand, but those are frequently out of stock (including at the time of publishing). In general, these are the best prices we’ve seen yet on this pricey storage.</p><p>The number of games you can install to a microSD Express card depends on the size of the card you buy, of course, as well as on the games in your library. For example, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-bananza-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> requires just 8.9GB, while <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Editio</em></a><em>n </em>eats up 60.6GB. Regardless, having extra space for digital games will likely be necessary at some point, even if it’s not right now.</p><p>Here’s another reason why you should consider buying one, especially while they’re cheaper: several publishers are opting for Nintendo’s Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641853/nintendo-describes-switch-2-game-key-cards">Game-Key cards</a>, which look like cartridges, but are effectively keys that unlock a download and authenticate your system to play it. So, even if you’re buying a physical cartridge of a new game, you may need to rely on the extra storage space afforded by a microSD Express card to let you play it.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797782/lexar-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
