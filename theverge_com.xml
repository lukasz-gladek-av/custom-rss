Nvidia had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">already delayed the RTX 5070 series</a> from its original launch date of February 28th.</p><p>Berraondo shared the following manufacturers that will have RTX 5070 cards at MSRP cost available from March 5th: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90yv0m11-m0aa00-asus-prime-geforce-rtxtm-5070-12gb-gddr7.html" rel="sponsored">Asus</a>, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1882292-REG%2Fgigabyte_gv_n5070wf3oc_12gd_geforce_rtx_5070_windforce.html" rel="sponsored">Gigabyte</a>, INNO3D, KFA2, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmsi-rtx-5070-12g-shadow-2x-oc-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12gb-gddr7%2Fp%2FN82E16814137944%3FItem%3DN82E16814137944" rel="sponsored">MSI</a>, Palit, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1874641-REG%2Fpny_vcg507012tfxpb1_o_nvidia_geforce_rtx_5070.html" rel="sponsored">PNY</a>, and <a href="https://www.zotacstore.com/us/graphics-cards/geforce-rtx-50-series/geforce-rtxtm-5070">Zotac</a>.</p><p>When Nvidia announced the 5070, the company said that it would offer similar performance to the $1,599 RTX 4090, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">our testing doesn’t align with that claim</a>. The longer wait and mixed reviews for the RTX 5070 Founders Edition adds to what’s been a rocky launch for Nvidia’s 50-series chips so far, including some “rare” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">manufacturing issues</a> with RTX 5090, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">RTX 5080</a>, and RTX 5070 Ti cards that were missing physical render output units (ROPs).</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
