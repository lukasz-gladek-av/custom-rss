            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft confirmed that it’s laying off as many as 9,100 employees, or about four percent of its workforce, in yet another round of cuts this year, reports the <em><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">Seattle Times</a></em>. Employees in Microsoft’s Xbox division, known as Microsoft Gaming, are being hit hard by these layoffs, although exact numbers and divisions are not yet known.</p><p>Xbox leader Phil Spencer said in a message to the team that “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Bloomberg</a></em> reports that the now-Microsoft-owned King division that makes <em>Candy Crush</em> is cutting about 10 percent of employees, or 200 people, while other European units like Zenimax have also confirmed they are cutting jobs. A <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">report from<em> VGC</em></a> says that UK-based developer Rare has also been affected, and that the long-in-development title <em>Everwild,</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965203/rare-everwild-xbox-windows-10-new-game-watch-trailer">announced in 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/696628/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">has been canceled</a> as a result.</p><p>These major layoffs come less than two months after Microsoft announced it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce">cutting more than 6,000 employees</a>, followed by an additional 305 reductions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/678376/microsoft-is-laying-off-300-more-employees">in early June</a>. Microsoft employees have faced a series of layoffs over the past year, including a round of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604850/microsofts-performance-based-layoffs">performance-based cuts</a> that have seriously hit morale, according to multiple Microsoft employees I’ve spoken to.</p><div><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees</a> in January 2024, followed by several game studios closures and job losses in May, and 1,000 job losses from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170902/microsoft-hololens-2-mixed-reality-azure-layoffs">HoloLens and Azure cloud teams in June</a>. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">laid off 650 more Xbox employees in September</a>, as part of a restructuring related to the company’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p></div><p>This is the memo that Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent to employees:</p><div><blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox]]></content:encoded>
