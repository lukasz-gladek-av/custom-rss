            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Even if it wasn’t the strongest year for Xbox exclusive games (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301358/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-launch-day-issues">and some of those exclusives had their issues</a>), Game Pass was still an extremely good deal for console owners. Mostly, it’s the variety; the subscription service continues to offer a great mix of new blockbuster releases, along with smaller indie games and older titles to round out the package. This year had everything from <em>Call of Duty</em>’s big coming-out party on Game Pass to a stop-motion adventure game to an expansion to one of last year’s biggest RPGs.</p><p>Here are nine great games to check out if you’re a new subscriber or just looking for something new to play.</p><p><h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></h3></p><p>Now that Activision Blizzard is under the Microsoft umbrella, the publisher’s biggest franchise is part of Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">And <em>Black Ops 6</em> is the first new release to debut on the subscription service</a>. That includes all of the game’s various modes: the cinematic single-player campaign, and multiplayer outings like Zombies.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Bethesda Softworks</cite></p></div><p><h3><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> had seemingly everyone thinking about a return to the wasteland, and Game Pass is a great way to jump in since it has every game in the series from <em>Fallout 3</em> on. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141907/best-fallout-3-4-76-new-vegas-start">There’s a lot to choose from</a> — but I’d recommend <em>New Vegas</em>. Not only does Sin City offer up a great location for a <em>Fallout</em> game but it’s also going to be a big part of the upcoming second season of the show.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking for something a little more laid back, <em>Harold Halibut</em> might be just the thing. A fairly traditional adventure game, <em>Harold Halibut</em> sets itself apart with a slow and steady pace, a fascinating sci-fi world, a dry but charming sense of humor, and stunning visuals featuring real stop-motion animation. It’s the kind of game where you really want to slow down anyways, to soak in all of the small details.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23724560/humanity-review-ps4-ps5-steam-vr"><em>Humanity</em></a></h3></p><p>One of the best puzzle games of the last few years is now on Game Pass. <em>Humanity</em> seems a little weird at first, as you control an ethereal Shiba Inu in order to guide mindless swaths of humans through increasingly complex mazes. But once you get accustomed to the way things work, <em>Humanity</em> offers up some of the most satisfying brain teasers you’re likely to find. Plus, the ghost dog sure is cute.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></h3></p><p>Reception has been mixed on this one, but it’s definitely worth checking out. <em>The Great Circle</em> blends together elements of adventure games and immersive sims, with the whip-cracking style of Indiana Jones. That makes it something of an acquired taste, but if that just so happens to be <em>your</em> taste, well, the flavor is delicious.</p><p><h3><em>Nine Sols</em></h3></p><p>In a great year for roguelike action games, <em>Nine Sols</em> still manages to stand out thanks to combat that’s so good it completely makes up for an underwhelming story. It’s the kind of action that really rewards being patient and learning to parry, which makes it all the more satisfying when you win a bout. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">the wait for <em>Silksong</em></a> continues to drag on, <em>Nine Sols</em> could be just the thing to fill in the gap.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’ve somehow finished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">the sprawling fantasy RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, there are thankfully plenty of excellent older titles from developer Atlus to check out. And this year, <em>Persona 3</em> — which originally launched on the PS2 and helped usher the series into a new era of popularity — got an excellent remake that helps bring it in line with its more modern successors.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">The original <em>Hellblade</em></a> was as terrifying as it was uncomfortable — and that hasn’t changed with the sequel. Instead, the developers at Ninja Theory have expanded the scale, improved the action, and somehow made the horror elements even scarier. It’s also a rare short blockbuster game, something you can complete in around 10 hours.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></a></h3></p><p>The first major expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> is a good excuse to jump back into this sci-fi universe. While I wish <em>Shattered Space</em> was a little weirder and leaned more into the cosmic horror side of things, it’s still unlike anything else in the main storyline. The expansion is also largely self-contained, so you can spend your time exploring one big planet instead of constantly jumping around the galaxy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
