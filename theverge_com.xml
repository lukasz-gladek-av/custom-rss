The long-running word game is adding four solo modes that can be played daily, and they’ll sound familiar to those who use <em>The</em> <em>New York Times’</em> gaming app.</p><p>The new games include a mini crossword puzzle; a word search; <em>Word Wheel</em>, which is about connecting letters to create words; and a word guessing game called <em>Guess Word</em>. You can see what they all look like in the gallery below:</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>Word Search.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Zynga</cite></p></div></div><p>Zynga, which owns <em>Words With Friends</em>, says that each of the games will have new puzzles daily and can be played either solo or in multiplayer. “Our players asked if they could do even more, so we’ve added a whole new layer of personally fulfilling solo mini-games where you can disconnect from the world and play word games, with or without friends,” Yaron Leyvand, Zynga’s executive vice president of mobile games, said in a statement.</p><div><p>The news comes as plenty of different outlets are trying to replicate or build on <em>Wordle</em>’s breakout success. <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> continues to test new games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281738/good-morning-sports-fans">a sports-themed take on <em>Connections</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265296/new-york-times-nyt-games-zorse-test">a puzzler called <em>Zorse</em></a>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">the Hearst-owned Puzzmo</a> is steadily building out an impressive library of games including recent releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">a weather-based version of sudoku</a>.
