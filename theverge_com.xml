            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Friday, we brought you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaked dimensions of the next Nintendo Switch</a> from the most likely source yet: a “3D scan of the actual hardware” obtained by case manufacturer Dbrand. But case manufacturers aren’t the<em> only</em> source of leaks.</p><p>A Redditor named “NextHandheld” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/">claims to have seen and touched</a> an actual final retail unit of the Nintendo Switch 2. I spoke with them, and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit.</p><p>In particular, I’ve seen two photos of a possible Nintendo Switch 2 dock, and one photo of the <em>inside</em> of a possible Switch 2 controller rail, covered in certification logos and with copper contacts exposed, which also shows its metal kickstand hinge open at an angle. Notably, the dock was <em>not</em> included in the 3D scan that’s circulating among case manufacturers.</p><p>If NextHandheld is telling the truth, we now know a good bit more about Nintendo’s next console. For example: as much as we’d love it to be called the “Super Nintendo Switch,” it’ll likely be introduced as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.  </p><p><h3>Name and date</h3></p><p>Officially, Nintendo has only called it “the successor to Nintendo Switch,” promised to formally announce the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">by March 31st, 2025</a>, and revealed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">be backward compatible</a> with original Switch games.</p><p>Unofficially, NextHandheld’s source has heard it might be announced as soon as January — and shared what they claim is first-hand evidence with <em>The Verge</em> that it is the Nintendo Switch 2. I saw a picture of a dock, with the same logo as as the original Nintendo Switch, only with a 2 attached. </p><p>And while NextHandheld says they’re “disappointed” that the dock doesn’t seem to have any more ports than the original — two USB-A, one HDMI, one ethernet, and one USB-C likely used for its power brick — it may have a <em>different</em> trick up its sleeve.</p><p><h3>Magnetic controllers — finally with drift-resistant joysticks</h3></p><p>In April, <a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/">Spanish pub Vandal</a>&nbsp;(which correctly reported&nbsp;<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350744733/nuevos-detalles-exclusivos-de-switch-pro-pantalla-tamano-dock-llegada-a-europa/">minor details of the Switch OLED</a>&nbsp;before launch) reported that, incredibly, Nintendo might replace the Switch’s controller rails with <em>magnets</em> so your Joy-Cons can magically snap into place. </p><p>Today, it no longer seems incredible, because the photo I saw of a joystick rail region contains no rail: it’s just a long, rounded, hollow area, with a 13-pin connector that sticks out so it can slot into the Joy-Con. NextHandheld says there’s a physical magnetic click when you attach them, and that you’ll press a much larger button on the controller, one that’s physically connected to a magnet, to release.</p><p>More importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 might finally get rid of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">the infamous “Joy-Con Drift” that plagues its controllers to this day</a>. NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don’t contain the same deteriorating sensor material and can be recalibrated easily. </p><p><h3>A U-shaped kickstand</h3></p><p>The original Nintendo Switch had a tiny, easy-to-topple gumstick of a kickstand, and the Switch OLED had a wide, flat plate. But the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature a U-shaped rail of a kickstand, according to a photo that NextHandheld shared with me. </p><p>I understand that the 3D CAD file shows the U-shape, too — and case manufacturers have begun sharing images of similar U-shaped kickstands, too. But it looks like it could be beefier than some of the mockups floating around:</p><p><h3>Extra power when docked?</h3></p><div><p>Once upon a time, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade">reportedly planning to release a Nintendo Switch Pro</a>, one that would output 4K graphics when docked to your TV, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained">at least partly thanks to Nvidia’s DLSS AI upscaling</a>. That didn’t happen, but the Nintendo Switch 2’s dock might be designed to let the handheld run a bit faster. </p></div><p>On Reddit, NextHandheld cryptically teased that asking if the dock had a fan was “the right question,” and in a picture shared with <em>The Verge</em>, I can see the alleged dock has big feet <em>around back, </em>ones positioned so it can lie down horizontally without blocking a set of vents. </p><p>While I don’t imagine you’d intentionally put it on its back, as the handheld might fall out of the completely open slot up top, I can imagine Nintendo wanting to make sure the console doesn’t overheat if you accidentally knock it over. </p><p>Intriguingly, NextHandheld says the dock is rated for 60W, while the Switch 2 is rated for 45W, both of which would be substantially higher than the original if true. The original Switch had an unusual 39W charger for both docked and handheld modes, which only provided up to 18W for the handheld.</p><p><h3>The many things we still don’t know</h3></p><p>You can dig through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/comments/">NextHandheld’s Reddit comments</a> or read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/">this early summary</a> for a lot more possible details about the new console. But the Redditor is upfront that they never got to turn the handheld on, or play any games. They don’t know whether a Switch 2 can play original Switch cartridges, or only digital Switch 1 games. They don’t know if it has a microphone, or a camera, or how much storage space it has, or its performance, or anything about its reportedly 8-inch screen, or its launch titles.</p><p>They do say it will launch in dark grey, however, like the original Nintendo Switch, and that it will be followed by a white model, and one themed with a Nintendo game that hasn’t received a themed Switch yet. And, they’re the latest to possibly corroborate a new second USB-C port on the top, though that was obviously revealed in the 3D scan.</p><p>If it’s true that Nintendo will announce the Switch 2 in January, though, you won’t have to wait long for more answers — or to find out if these ones are true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324420/one-billion-users-card-game-social-network-techdirt-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My social network was booming. I had attracted top-tier users: the coveted Trendsetter, the popularity-lured Investor. I had bested server problems and bad press. Then, somebody picked a particularly unlucky card out of the One Billion Users deck I was testing. Sixty seconds later, I had lost it all.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/one-billion-users-the-social-media-card-game">One Billion Users</a> is a new card game from Techdirt and Diegetic Games, and at its best, it lends itself to moments like this. Currently in its last days on Kickstarter, intended to fund a single run of the game rather than a wide release, it’s the latest in a string of projects from the team-up — including the digital games <em>Moderator Mayhem</em> and <em>Trust &amp; Safety Tycoon</em> as well as<em> </em>CIA: Collect It All, a card game built on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17374054/cia-collect-it-all-declassified-training-tabletop-card-game">real CIA training materials</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One Billion Users<em> </em>is a lot less nerdy than any of these. It’s inspired by the relatively simple 1906 racing-themed card game Touring, better known through a popular 1950s adaptation called Mille Bornes.&nbsp;Only, instead of trying to drive the fastest while sandbagging competitors, you’re trying to build the biggest social network while sabotaging everyone else.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A set of blocker, community, influencer, hotfix, and event cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The game, for two to four players, involves drawing and playing cards that will either help build your own social platform or stop someone else from growing theirs. The most basic is a “community” card, which represents a number of users joining a platform. Since the goal is to outpace everyone else’s growth, you can also play “blocker” cards (like “low on funds” or “server overload”) on an opponent’s network, either limiting or completely stopping them from putting down community cards. If a blocker is played on you, you can resolve it by playing a “hotfix” card (“server upgrade,” for instance) or sacrificing a certain number of other cards.</p><p>Techdirt founder Mike Masnick says that while mulling a follow-up to the CIA card game, he was inspired by playing Mille Bornes with his family, then discovering its public domain predecessor Touring. The team considered a few different themes — “espionage, cryptocurrency, AI, and even the general worship of tech entrepreneurs,” Masnick says. They settled on social networks, and One Billion Users was born.</p><p>Admittedly, most networks don’t —&nbsp;as far as the public knows — spend a lot of time trying to literally break competitors’ sites. But while the blocker system mostly grew out of its source material, Masnick still says it “generally felt realistic in tone,” particularly as companies try to capitalize on each other’s problems. (Masnick sits on the board of Bluesky, which has recently lured millions of Twitter refugees by doing exactly that.) And in the game’s defense, remember when Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents">started sabotaging</a> each other’s friend-finding tools?</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> core formula is very similar to Touring and Mille Bornes — you’re adding users instead of mileage, playing blockers instead of car breakdowns, and resolving them with hotfixes instead of things like spare tires. But the game adds a few major, thematically appropriate mechanics.</p><p>The first big change is a mechanic called “toxicity.” Every community card in your network adds a varying amount of it, and if your ratio of toxicity to users at the end of the game is too high, you’ll be penalized. It also matters occasionally throughout the game: a “toxic culture” blocker, for instance, means you can <em>only </em>add highly toxic community cards to your network.</p><div><p>“Networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture”</p></div><p>The second is influencers: cards representing big-time users with dedicated communities, which are drawn and automatically handed to the player who meets their condition. Common conditions include joining the biggest or smallest network, but there are more idiosyncratic ones, like the Contrarian, who’s drawn to the most toxic network. Players can steal influencers from each other, essentially conducting the card game version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298963/ninja-shroud-mixer-facebook-gaming-twitch">Microsoft’s Mixer signing Ninja</a>.</p><p>Another added bit of complexity are “event” cards, which either temporarily change the rules of play or require everyone to take an action. That unlucky card above, for instance, forced every influencer to reevaluate which network they were joining… and it turned out, my community no longer served their needs.</p><p>Where <em>Trust &amp; Safety Tycoon</em> is a pretty rigorous (if tongue-in-cheek) attempt to convey how hard running a social network is, One Billion Users is far more impressionistic. Its cards hold some commentary on social media and the tech industry, but its appeal remains very similar to the satisfaction of screwing over other drivers with road hazards. Conversely, if you’ve experienced the frustration of being constantly stalled by hazards in Mille Bornes, One Billion Users makes it easier to fix them — but my play group still frequently got stuck in doldrums.</p><p>My playthroughs of One Billion Users<em> </em>varied heavily based on how the deck was stacked. It was possible to end up with a fun balance of growth and sabotage. It was also easy to end up with a hand stuffed with hotfix cards during numerous rounds where nobody was playing blockers or a bunch of influencer-stealing cards in a game where none of the influencers had yet appeared.&nbsp;Also, nobody I played with wanted to tally its fairly complex points system at the end, including the toxicity penalty. (There’s an optional mechanic that adds extra conditions themed after specific networks —&nbsp;it’s a fun idea, but also <em>even more tallying</em>.) On our internet, whoever signed up the most users won, quality of life be damned.&nbsp;</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> exact rules are still in flux, and it’s possible some of this will change. But ultimately, as a longtime spectator of social media shenanigans, my favorite part was deciding which social network I was building. My influencer-filled stronghold? The golden age of Twitter. Its sad, empty shell? Now I was running X.</p><p>Apparently, I wasn’t the only one doing that. “I find it interesting to see how networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture,” Masnick says. One of his testers, a high schooler, realized midway through the game that his network was hopelessly and intractably toxic. His response, announced to the rest of the table as he embraced the chaos? “He was ‘going full Reddit.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
