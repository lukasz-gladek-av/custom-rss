In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420782">latest Steam client beta</a> spotted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/12/steam-finally-goes-native-on-apple-silicon-heres-how-to-try-it/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, Valve says the “Steam Client and Steam Helper apps now run natively on Apple Silicon.”</p><p>That means Steam will no longer need to use Rosetta 2 to run on Macs with M-series chips. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer">Rosetta 2 is the emulator</a> that allows Intel-based apps to run on Apple Silicon’s ARM architecture. Native support for Apple Silicon should make Steam run more smoothly.</p><p>The update follows Apple’s announcement that it will stop <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/683846/macos-tahoe-intel-x86-arm-m-cpu">launching major updates for Intel-based</a> Macs after macOS Tahoe. The company <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">has also confirmed</a> that Rosetta 2 will only be available through macOS 27. “Beyond this timeframe, we will keep a subset of Rosetta functionality aimed at supporting older unmaintained gaming titles, that rely on Intel-based frameworks,” Apple says.</p><p>You can <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">try out the Steam beta</a> by opening the app on your Mac, selecting <strong>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</strong>. From there, look for the “Client Beta Participation” heading, and select <strong>Steam Beta Update</strong> from the dropdown menu. Steam will then prompt you to relaunch the app.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 is a hit (and a supply chain success story). Microsoft is starting to show off its plan for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">the future of Xbox</a>. And everywhere you look, there are reasons to think we’re headed toward a very different kind of gaming device. Maybe it’ll be even more modular and portable. Maybe it’ll be even more like a Windows PC. Maybe it’ll be all that a bunch of other things besides.</p><div><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, Nilay and David are joined by <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="http://[Threads is finally getting DMs | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/684120/threads-direct-messaging-inbox-dm-test-availability)">Jake Kastrenakes</a> to talk all about the future of gaming. We’ll have more of a Switch 2 review on the show next Tuesday, but for now there’s a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">Xbox Ally stuff </a>to talk about, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">3.5 million Switch 2s</a> to reckon with. Before we get into that, though, we talk a bit more about this year’s WWDC, why Apple executives spent so much time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685106/apple-ai-siri-delay-craig-federighi-greg-joswiak-wwdc-2025">apologizing for and explaining Siri</a>, and why <em>F1 </em>seemed to be what the company <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/f1-apple-movie-strategy-tim-cook-lewis-hamilton-1236424270/">actually wanted to talk about</a>.</p></div><div><p>After that, we run through some AI news. Because there’s a lot of it. Disney is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/685433/disney-universal-sue-midjourney-copyright-infringement">suing Midjourney</a>; Google Zero is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684192/online-publishers-are-facing-a-chatbot-calamity">rapidly approaching</a>; Alexa Plus is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684560/amazon-alexa-plus-one-million-users-coming-summer-2025">apparently actually out there</a>; and the Dia browser has some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/web/685232/dia-browser-ai-arc">big ideas about chatbots</a>.
