            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649138/mario-kart-world-direct-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is possibly hoping to steer the narrative regarding the Switch 2 back in a positive direction by showing off its most exciting game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. The publisher held a <em>Mario Kart World</em> direct presentation on April 17th debuting 15 minutes of gameplay which showcased many of the game’s new features.</p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> will feature a bunch of new courses to race through. There’s Mario Bros Circuit, the desert roadtrip-looking course Nintendo’s shown off in every <em>Mario Kart World</em> video; an urban course called Crown City; Salty Salty Speedway, which is one of <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s water levels; and many more including returning classics like Peach Beach and Wario Shipyard. Nintendo also hinted that once you complete all the Grand Prix cups a “certain colorful course” will appear which can’t be anything other than the iconic Rainbow Road.</p><p>There are lots of new items, features, and settings to make the most out of your race to the finish. The new feather item lets you jump to avoid attacks. The new rewind feature lets you rewind time so you can hit that missed trick or jump to find secret areas. Speaking of secret areas, in the game’s free roam mode you can find all kinds of hidden secrets like P-switches and panels that unlock overworld missions to complete. Nintendo’s gone all out to make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the standout game for the Switch 2 — now if only the US could pre-order the dang thing.</p><p>You can watch the full event below:</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">initial excitement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2</a> has cooled. Consumers have been left reeling from the price of the console, announced at $450, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">which has the potential to balloon in the United States</a> due to the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">ruinous tariff policy</a>. (Trump has decreed a 90-day pause on the tariffs which ostensibly gives Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">more time to ship to the US as many units as it can</a>.)</p></div><p>The games too will be more expensive, with some titles, including <em>Mario Kart World</em>, blowing past the $70 price point <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">to retail at $80</a>. That is, if you can even get the console to play it. US consumers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">cannot yet pre-order the Switch 2</a> (once again, thanks to the tariffs) which has also impeded Canada from pre-orders as well. Nintendo has not yet signaled when it’ll open up pre-orders for the two countries but said that the console will still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">go on sale there June 5th</a>. <em>Mario Kart World</em> will be launching alongside the new console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is preventing some users from accessing sensitive content unless they allow the platform to verify their age by scanning their face or ID. The new age verification process is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group#h_01JQ4N4R4K238K45JTARQVK2CN">described as an “experiment” by Discord</a>, and is being trialed in the United Kingdom and Australia in response to local laws that require online platforms to have guardrails in place for safeguarding children.</p><p>The new face and ID scanning requirements only apply to Discord users who haven’t previously verified their age on the platform. Discord says this is a “one-time process” that will be triggered in two situations: when users are exposed to nude or sexually explicit content that’s been flagged by Discord’s sensitive media filter, or when users attempt to change filter control settings to prevent such content from being blurred or blocked. </p><p>An age verification window will then appear that prompts the user to either allow Discord to access their device camera and scan their face, or submit a photograph of their ID by scanning a QR code via their phone.</p><p>Discord is likely trialing this process to appease new laws in the UK and Australia that aim to restrict children from accessing sensitive material online. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23922397/uk-online-safety-bill-law-passed-royal-assent-moderation-regulation">UK’s Online Safety Act</a> requires online platforms that may host pornographic content to introduce “robust” age-checking techniques, while <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o">Australia is requiring that under-16s</a> be prevented from accessing social media platforms entirely. We have asked Discord if it has any plans to roll out its experimental age verification process in other regions.</p><p>Discord is placing a surprising amount of trust in the accuracy of the face scanning tool, given some users may be banned if the process decides they look too young to be using the platform. Discord says that users who are verified incorrectly can retry the process or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731">request a manual review</a>, and that users who have been erroneously banned can appeal the decision.</p><p>Discord says the information submitted during this age verification experiment won’t be stored by the company or any of its vendors, regardless of what verification method you choose. “For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face,” says Discord. “For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
