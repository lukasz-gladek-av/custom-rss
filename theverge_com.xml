            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Not to be upstaged by all the Nintendo Switch 2 shenanigans, PlayStation decided to steal some of that attention back in the form of a major, nostalgia-fueled announcement: <em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s is getting a remake and it’s coming in September.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles </em>will take players back to a time when <em>Final Fantasy</em> wasn’t an action RPG or even a turn-based RPG but an isometric strategy game. Take control of Ramza Beoulve as he fights in the Lion War and build an army of powerful fighters utilizing the game’s job system. But don’t expect just the standard RPG classes, like Fighter, Black Mage, or Summoner. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a host of unique, often arcane, and never-seen-again job types, like Geomancer, Chemist, and Oracle. For this new edition, players will be able to choose between the classic version of the 1998 original PlayStation game or an enhanced version with fully voiced dialogue and other quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>The original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was released in the US in 1998 and is considered by some to be the best game in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> oeuvre. I myself have never played the game, though have heard tales of its legendary storyline and utterly busted job classes, like the Arithmatician (seriously). And because of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> franchise’s 30-year history, there are some newer and younger fans who probably didn’t know this game existed before today. I look forward to finding out what it’s all about when <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> launches September 30th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
