For the retailer’s midnight openings for the Switch 2 launch, “most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase,” <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1742407305710" rel="sponsored">according to its website</a>. </p><p>Most Best Buy stores across the country will be opening up at 12:01AM ET on June 5th for the launch, per the website. (If you’re on the West Coast like me, that means your store will open at 9:01PM PT on June 4th.) People who snagged preorders for in-store pickup can also get their consoles when the stores open. As part of the midnight launch, Best Buy also says that customers will “have the chance to receive a Nintendo collectible.”</p><p>Online preorders last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">were a total mess to start</a>, but many people had success the old-fashioned way: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up at GameStop</a>. With Best Buy offering its limited in-store stock, lining up ahead of June 5th might be the way to go if you don’t have a preorder in and want to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> on day one.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
