Stripe’s terms and conditions does <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/prohibited-and-restricted-businesses-list-faqs">prohibit the sale of any kind of adult content</a>, but on social media, some callers have reported Stripe customer support reps have said “No,” when directly asked if Stripe permits the sale of legal, non-adult, LGBT content.</p></div><p>“Twice today, when pressured, Stripe operators have said, plainly, that I cannot use Stripe for the purchase of LGBTQ content,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3lwa2ig3o4s2g">wrote Dieselbrain</a>, a monsterkink artist on Bluesky. “Not just adult content, but explicitly LGBTQ.”</p><p>Others <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madycast.com/post/3lwciacse6s2h">have shared recordings</a> of calls where Stripe representatives say that it prohibits LGBTQ content. <em>The Verge </em>has reviewed one recording where a caller asks for clarification on whether Stripe allows LGBTQ content. The Stripe representative then says, “As far as we know, no. We restricted all that content three weeks ago.”</p><p>According to Becker, this is a mistake. “We’re looking into this and making sure future inquiries are answered correctly,” Becker said.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/758927/stripe-lgbt-content-statement-itchio-adult-content]]></content:encoded>
