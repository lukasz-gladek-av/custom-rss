For instance, if you’ve been itching to revisit <em><strong><strong><em>Chrono Trigger</em></strong></strong></em> in honor of <a href="https://x.com/SquareEnix/status/1899460368344252493">the game’s 30th anniversary</a> this week, you can now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F613830%2FCHRONO_TRIGGER%2F" rel="sponsored">snag Square Enix’s fabled SNES RPG for $3.74</a> (about $11 off).

The 22-inch stereo soundbar makes some concessions to keep the cost down (RIP, HDMI), but it still manages to deliver excellent dialogue clarity and crisp, balanced sound that one-ups most other soundbars in its price range. It also taps into the rest of the Sonos ecosystem, naturally, and supports AirPlay 2 for streaming from various Apple devices. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23149484/sonos-ray-soundbar-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.thensf.org/sleep-awareness-week/">Sleep Awareness Week</a> is a thing, apparently, and the reason why <strong>Headspace</strong> has <a href="https://checkout.headspace.com/checkout?voucherCode=40SLEEP2025A">dropped the price of its annual subscription</a> to $41.99 ($28 off) through March 18th. A subscription grants you access to a robust catalog of well-curated sleepcasts, not to mention guided meditation sessions, focus music, and daily inspirational videos. The app’s searchability and the gradual progression of the courses remain the best parts of Headpace, though, especially if you’re a relative newcomer to mindfulness exercises.</span></li><li><span>If PC games aren’t your thing, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/626792/finall">Sony’s new <em>Astro Bot</em> PlayStation 5 bundle</a>, which pairs a 1TB PS5 “slim” with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320203/astro-bot-is-the-2024-game-of-the-year">last year’s Game of the Year</a>, is now available for $449 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-ASTRO-Bundle-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DWGLDS2V/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/auha8bm69jl94">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPS5-Standard-Bundle-Astrobot%2F15239011502" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/627954/star-of-providence-review-nintendo-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Star of Providence</em> is like a retro game I would have loved as a kid. But the roguelike bullet hell shooter is also a modern twin-stick shooter, and the melding of the two eras results in a fun, fast, and challenging experience.</p><p>In <em>Star</em>, you control a ship and explore randomly generated dungeons. As you navigate room by room — similar to an old-school <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game — you’ll pick up powerful weapons to fight the many enemies you’ll stumble across in your dungeon crawling.</p><p>The weapons are a delight, filling your screen with bullets and lasers. Sometimes, you’ll get cool effects like the ability for your bullets to phase through one side of the screen and appear on the other. But enemies can also spew out huge amounts of bullets, and that means many rooms turn into chaos as you weave through attack patterns to line up a perfect shot. The game’s narrow aspect ratio makes rooms feel pretty small, too (though I appreciate how it adds to the retro vibe).</p><p><em>Star’s</em> controls are tight, so it always feels like you can thread the needle to escape danger. A useful dash can get you out of rough spots. And you can deploy bombs to clear bullets from a room, but they can take a while to recharge.</p><p>As you explore dungeons, you’ll have to make a lot of typical roguelike-y choices, like what to buy at a shop or what upgrades to pick. Arguably the most important choice is what weapons you’ll pick up along the way: they’re much more powerful than your basic gun, but they also have a limited amount of ammo. But I found that made for some fun strategy. Do I buy a weapon right when I come upon a store but risk running out of ammo before I really need it? Or should I try to survive a floor without it and instead buy the weapon when I’m about to take on the floor’s boss?</p><p>Speaking of bosses: they’re awesome. They’re typically giant, taking up a good portion of the square screen, and they spew bullets in all sorts of unpredictable and nail-biting patterns. I’m a particularly big fan of the <a href="https://starofprovidence.wiki.gg/wiki/Daemon">huge green skeleton with horns</a>.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite thing about <em>Star</em> is that everything is <em>fast</em>. Rooms typically take just seconds to clear, meaning you can zip through a whole dungeon floor in a few minutes. The game’s map lets you instantly teleport to rooms you’ve previously been to as you’re exploring a floor. Even boss fights usually only take a minute or two. And when you want to start a new run, all you need to do is go through a door at your home base.</p><p>There’s a constant sense of forward momentum that I think more games should emulate. That actually might be where <em>Star</em> is most like the old-school games it’s inspired by: jumping into the action is almost as easy as adding another quarter to an arcade machine.</p><p><sub>Star of Providence<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hear-what-horizon-zero-dawn-actor-ashly-burch-thinks-about-sony-ai-taking-her-job.1135242/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ashly Burch, the award-winning voice and performance actor behind <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>’s Aloy — one of the most prominent characters on PlayStation today — has some news and some very strong thoughts about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the leaked Sony experiment that saw her character voiced and performed by AI technology</a> instead of her or any other human being.</p></div><p>The video, originally shared with <em>The Verge</em> by a tipster and later pulled off YouTube by a copyright enforcement company that counts Sony PlayStation as a client, was of an internal prototype — not necessarily something that’s in production for actual games. Burch says <em>Horizon</em> developer Guerilla proactively confirmed to her that it is <em>not</em> actively in development. Nor did it use her voice or facial data, Guerilla claimed. </p><p>But Burch says having seen the demo, she is worried, and not just about her own career. “I feel worried about this art form,” she says. You can watch her video immediately below, or scroll down for a transcript. </p><p>The transcript:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hi. Let’s talk about AI Aloy. I saw the tech demo earlier this week. Guerilla reached out to me to let me know that the demo didn’t reflect anything that was actively in development. They didn’t use any of my performance for the demo, so none of my facial or voice data. And Guerilla owns Aloy as a character.</p><p>So all that said, I feel worried. And not worried about Guerilla specifically or <em>Horizon</em> or my performance or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form.</p><p>We are currently on strike. SAG-AFTRA is on strike against video games because of AI. Because this technology exists, because we know that game companies want to use it, we’re asking for protections.</p><p>So currently what we’re fighting for is that you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double.</p><p>And I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Because of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements.</p><p>I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it. That does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse.</p><p>They wouldn’t have any protections. Any way to fight back. And that possibility… it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me.</p><p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances.</p><p>I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a slightly longer TikTok version of the video, which we’ve embedded above to replace the original Instagram copy, Burch adds that “I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology is not the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike, and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.”</p><p>It’s unusual for performers who have such a close relationship with game companies to speak out like this, but we’re also in an unusual moment: as she points out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">video game actors are on strike right now, specifically because of AI</a><em>, </em>and the very idea that a company like Sony is explicitly building and demonstrating ways to potentially replace actors like Burch is exactly what the striking workers fear.</p><p>In addition to starring in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Burch has had minor roles in other Sony games including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, but is otherwise best known for playing Chloe Price in the <em>Life Is Strange</em> games, Tiny Tina in <em>Borderlands</em>, and from the live-action D&amp;D roleplaying series <em>Critical Role</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">Apple TV Plus’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, where she also serves as a writer.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 14th:</strong></em> <em>Swapped Instagram video for Burch’s longer uncut TikTok video and added its additional context.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
