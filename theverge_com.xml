            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346145/nintendo-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-team-credits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, the just-launched port of the 2010 Wii game, doesn’t include individual members of the original Retro Studios development team in the credits, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-addresses-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-credits-controversy/1100-6528879/">as reported by <em>GameSpot</em></a>. Since the discovery, however, Nintendo has commented on the omission, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make">giving a statement to <em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>“We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game’s creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process,” the statement reads, which is sourced only to Nintendo and not to a specific individual. The game’s credits reveal that the port was done by Forever Entertainment.</p><p>Crediting is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-crediting-is-still-a-huge-problem-but-one-group-of-volunteers-is-working-on-solutions">an industry-wide issue</a>, and this isn’t the first time Nintendo has come under scrutiny for its crediting decisions. Some developers who worked on the original <em>Metroid Prime</em> — another Retro Studios game — were unhappy that <em>Metroid Prime Remastered’s </em>credits <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-e6e43a9d-510c-4746-ba2c-a855bf908692.html">didn’t include the full original credits</a>. And external translators have expressed frustrations with being left out of credits for some major Nintendo games, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators"><em>Game Developer</em> reported last year</a>.</p><div><p>As of late, Nintendo has also been somewhat cagey about things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23860180/mario-new-voice-actor-super-bros-wonder-nintendo">voice actors</a> and the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/mario-and-luigi-brotherships-secret-developer-has-been-revealed-as-octopath-travelers-acquire">specific studios developing its games</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
