            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661807/nvidia-rtx-5060-cards-laptops-release-date-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Feven-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released%2F" rel="sponsored">has announced</a> a May 19th release date for its $299 RTX 5060 graphics card and the first laptops, which start at $1,099, that will feature it. The company says they’ll be available to buy from retail partners starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.</p><p>At 3,840 CUDA cores, the RTX 5060 has nearly 800 fewer cores than the 5060 Ti Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">released last month</a> and is the most basic of the RTX 50-series. But like the Ti version, the 5060 has GDDR7 memory, supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and gets the latest ray tracing and tensor cores. The company says more games are being updated with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation before the 5060 launches, including <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans </em>on May 7th and <em>New World: Aeternum</em> on May 13th. </p><p>Whether the card is worth picking up, though, is another story. The RTX 5060 is limited to just 8GB of VRAM, and chances are good it’ll cost more than its suggested $299 retail price. Retailers started selling GPUs, including the other RTX 50-series cards, at a premium even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">before President Trump’s tariffs took hold</a>. And as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again"><em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> noted recently, Trump’s removal of the de minimus exemption last week could also impact pricing via extra import taxes on shipments valued at or under $800.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new trailer is — like the first — pretty heavily focused on setting up the characters and world, without much in the way of gameplay (though the developer does call it “the biggest, most immersive evolution of the series yet”).</p><p>But we do have a few more details about the story. Here’s the description from Rockstar:</p><div><blockquote><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote></div><p>And here are some closer looks at the setting (you can see more images and videos <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads">right here</a>):</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->12</strong><span><cite>Image: Rockstar Games</cite></span></p></section><div><p>The sixth <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game was previously slated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">to launch in fall 2025</a> on the PS5 and Xbox Series S / X (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607885/gta-vi-is-still-coming-this-fall">publisher Take-Two was pretty confident about hitting that window</a>), but was later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">pushed to May 2026</a>. It tells a Bonnie and Clyde–style story set in a fictionalized version of Florida called Leonida, which is home to the iconic Vice City. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614743/gta-vi-user-generated-content-roblox-fortnite">Reports have also suggested</a> that user-generated content could play a major role in the release.</p></div><div><p>Of course, <em>GTA</em> fans are used to waiting around. It’s been over a decade since <em>GTA V</em> first launched and was then subsequently ported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980756/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-next-gen-ps5-xbox-hands-on">to multiple generations of consoles</a>, selling more than 200 million copies over that span. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22978906/gta-online-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-version-next-gen-career-missions-graphics">the game’s online mode became a juggernaut</a>, and Rockstar also released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4">a little game called <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a>.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
