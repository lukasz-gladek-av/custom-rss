            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/636243/metaphor-refantazio-ui-menu-interview-koji-ise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game menus tend to fade into the background — but that’s not the case with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a></em>. Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"><em>Persona</em> games before it</a>, the fantasy RPG has an interface that’s slick, aggressive, and certainly not the kind of thing you’ll forget. And according to lead interface designer Koji Ise, the intent was to create menus that matched and enhanced what players were feeling at any given moment. “As long as we’re able to identify ‘at this point the player should be feeling this,’ we’re able to match our UI and animations to act as emotional accelerators,” he says.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> is developed by Atlus, and it’s a spiritual successor of sorts to the <em>Persona</em> series. Both are turn-based RPGs, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona"><em>Metaphor</em> shifts the setting from modern-day Japan to a new fantasy realm</a>. That turn-based nature means the menus are integral to the experience. You don’t skip past them to get to the action; they <em>are</em> the action. Since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Persona 3</a></em>, the franchise has become highly regarded for its stylized menus, and that’s something Ise wanted to continue with <em>Metaphor</em>, though it was actually his first experience working in video games.</p><p>“Before this I used to work on website designs, and mainly used Flash to make various animations,” he explains. “It allowed us to make very interactive animations, which maybe you don’t see as much anymore. I thought that my forte with creating interactive animations would serve me well working with Atlus in trying to create UI there.”</p><p>The starting point was purely visual. Ise knew he wanted to create something intrinsically fantasy to match the game’s setting. Early designs included one made with parchment paper and another that tried to emulate the anxiety the lead character experiences throughout the story. “We started from ground zero,” Ise says, noting that he didn’t initially look at a game like <em>Persona 5</em> as a starting place. Here are a few of the early concepts:</p><p>But as game development continued, and <em>Metaphor</em>’s features became finalized, things shifted to the more functional aspects of the interface design. This is where the <em>Persona</em> connection came in. “As we were firming up the specification, there were certain elements from <em>Persona</em> that we decided to carry over,” he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge, according to Ise, was adding the emotional element. As an example, since combat can be very difficult in <em>Metaphor</em>, he wanted to heighten the feeling of speed and aggression with the menu design. “When players are smashing away at an enemy, we assume that emotions are running high and they’re experiencing exhilaration,” Ise explains. “Your life hangs in the balance with every fight. So we wanted to make sure that came across within the UI.” Nailing those feelings involved working closely with the other teams at Atlus.</p><p>Similarly challenging was balancing Ise’s vision for the visual style with the practical concerns of crafting a UI for a video game. “There were times in the development process when it seemed a little too lopsided on the aesthetic side of things, and there was feedback from the team that it went a little overboard or was too hard to understand,” Ise says. “So we try to strike that balance without killing the design or the visuals. Because if we lean in too much towards the functional side of things that would take away what makes us Atlus.”</p><p>All of this requires a great deal of work in terms of design, iteration, and coordination. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">As <em>Metaphor</em> and <em>Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino told me last year</a>, building these menus “is actually really annoying to do” because of all that time and effort. Ise agrees, saying “it was a lot of trouble.” But he notes that “we wanted to make sure that the menu became the face of the title, something where the design would be unforgettable for players.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The latest update for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is going back in time. Called <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/">Relics</a>, the expansion launches today and introduces paleontology and archaeology elements to the sci-fi exploration game; players can now unearth the bones of alien creatures, piece them together, and even erect museums.</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is that players will be able to assemble the ancient creatures however they’d like. Here’s how developer Hello Games explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect. It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p><p>Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.</p></blockquote></div><p>Naturally, since this is <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, there’s also an element of danger. Certain bones and underground treasures will be guarded by golem-like creatures and a giant new type of worm.</p><div><p>As with all of the game’s major updates, Relics is free to download, and it joins an increasingly massive list of new content for the game since its launch in 2016. Most recently, that has included <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1">big changes to the game’s graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update">the addition of trillions of new planets</a>, and just as important: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing">fishing</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
