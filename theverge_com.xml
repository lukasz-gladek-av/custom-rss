            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623978/monster-hunter-wilds-salesrecordcapcom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though only out for a grand total of four days, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> has sold an astonishing 8 million copies. That’s according to Capcom, reporting that the monster hunting action RPG has become the company’s <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html">fastest selling title ever</a>.</p><p>The <em>Monster Hunter </em>franchise has racked up a number of superlatives for its publisher with 2018’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> selling <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">21 million copies to date</a> to become the company’s best selling game. With these statistics, combined with the success of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil</em> remakes</a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23741204/street-fighter-6-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Street Fighter VI</a></em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24111687/dragons-dogma-2-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> (not to mention <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch">MonHun Rise</a></em>), Capcom is one of the few publishers not currently on fire amidst the industry’s larger financial and labor crisis. Even better, it’s parlaying that success into developing new creative endeavors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a> or reviving much beloved but dormant franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a>.</p><p>For now, players seem to be enjoying the hell outta <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so much that it’s causing commotion in the real world. According to a report in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-so-popular-it-caused-a-run-on-an-unexpected-dish-in-japan/1100-6529845/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>Gamespot</em></a>, <em>MonHun </em>fans are finding the cheese naan that players can make in the game so appealing that it’s selling out in restaurants that specialize in the dish.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
