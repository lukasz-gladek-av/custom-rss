            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago, the last time Framework had an event in San Francisco, California, the highlight was the Framework Laptop 16 — a laptop promising the “holy grail” of upgradable graphics cards, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">easily one of the most ambitious laptops ever made</a>.</p><p>But today, the Framework Laptop 16 got little mention at its new event, which focused on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">new, similarly gamer-oriented Framework Desktop</a> instead. While the Desktop and Framework’s original 13-inch laptop both got the latest AMD processors today, we don’t yet know if or when the Framework Laptop 16 might leap forward too.</p><p>The only mention of Framework’s flagship laptop was a new “One Key Module” that will experimentally be available for the Framework community to build their own electromechanical keyboards, should they choose to, that would be thin enough to fit in the Laptop 16’s extremely thin Input Module bay. (You can see how the Input Modules work <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7269794917466115374">in my video here</a>.)</p><div><p>While Framework did finally<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322955/framework-16-expansion-bay-dual-m2-adapter"> ship its promised M.2 adapter bay in December</a>, which will let you stick extra SSDs or other peripherals into a Framework Laptop 16 instead of a discrete graphics card, my big question is: is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">promising but somewhat problematic laptop</a> a dead end, or will it get new mainboards and new chips in the future?</p></div><p>I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel at the event today, and he wouldn’t say much, but he was clear on one thing: “We’re nowhere near done with Framework Laptop 16.”</p><p>I pushed my luck, asking: Is today the day he can assure us that the Laptop 16 will eventually see at least one GPU upgrade or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23612467/framework-laptop-16-battery-parts-games">snap-on secondary battery</a>?</p><p>“Today is not that day,” he told me.</p><p>I want to see Framework succeed, and perhaps it’s too early to begin to wonder otherwise — it was still shipping preordered batches of the Laptop 16 to buyers through the middle of last year.</p><div><p>But we’ve pushed the company pretty hard on the GPU in the past specifically because it’s a thing rivals have tried and failed at before — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement">Dell/Alienware even got sued over the failed promise of the Alienware Area-51m</a>, which never bothered to ship a second generation of its supposedly upgradable GPUs.</p></div><p>Framework has resisted our pushes so far, stopping short of confirming it in our 2023 story: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=upgradability%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Patel.%20%E2%80%9C-,We%20are%20committed,-to%20making%20sure">here’s his exact language at the time</a>. It’d be nice if Framework could assure buyers that the upgrades are absolutely coming. But personally, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">more than a few things</a> about that laptop I’d like to change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Framework was doing a bit of a rethink even if it does deliver.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is adding a fresh gaming laptop to the pile of new models up for preorder today: the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-18%2FRZ09-05297ER3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Blade 18</a>. Like its smaller (but far from <em>small</em>) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Blade 16</a> cousin, the new Razer Blade 18 will come with Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs and Intel Arrow Lake CPUs. But one major way it differs is its large 18-inch display, which has dual modes allowing it to run at either 3840 x 2400 at 240Hz or 1920 x 1200 at 440Hz.</p><p>The Blade 18 will start at $3,199.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti and climb to $4,499.99 with an RTX 5090. But if either the Blade 18 or the already announced $2,799.99 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Blade 16</a> are the right pricey option for you, you’ll have to wait until late-April for them to actually ship.</p><p>Razer isn’t the only PC manufacturer offering new gaming laptops for preorder today. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610255/nvidia-rtx-50-series-gaming-laptop-preorders-begin-february-25th">Nvidia already teased</a>, a variety of new notebooks sporting RTX 50-series GPUs now have finalized pricing, and there are fresh offerings from the likes of <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/content/2025-rog-gaming-laptops/">Asus ROG</a>, <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/rtx50-gaming-laptops">MSI</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/gaming-pc/laptops.html" rel="sponsored">HP</a>. Back when many of these laptops were first announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340121/ces-2025-laptops-best-lenovo-asus-msi-razer-alienware">CES</a> in January, they mostly had estimated prices or no pricing at all.</p><p>Asus’s flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">ROG Strix Scar 16</a>, with its new wraparound RGB lighting, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-strix/rog-strix-scar-16-2025">starts at $3,299.99</a> with an RTX 5080 GPU and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog%2F90nr0l81-m005p0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">$4,299.99</a> with a top-of-the-line RTX 5090. The sleeker Zephyrus G14, which is a <em>Verge </em>favorite for balancing gaming performance with everyday usability, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/wtb/">starts at $2,499.99</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti. And the larger Zephyrus G16 starts with the same GPU at <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2025-gu605/wtb/">$2,699.99</a>. The G14 can go up to the RTX 5080, but the G16 will go all the way to an RTX 5090 once those higher-end configurations come a little later.</p><p>MSI has its RTX 5090-equipped <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/msi-Titan-18-HX-AI-A2XWJG-016US">Titan 18 HX AI</a> is up for preorder for an astounding $5,999.99. (That’s not even MSI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">ridiculous Dragon Edition Norse Myth</a>, which is still listed as “coming soon.”) The company has some of its slightly more down-to-Earth gaming laptops up for preorder as well, like the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Stealth-18-HX-AI-A2XWHG-029US">Stealth 18 HX AI</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti starting at $2,999.99.</p><p>Lots of these gaming laptops are sitting at the high end with high prices, and some are more expensive than their last-gen versions with 40-series GPUs. Like, previous generations we may have to wait until cheaper mobile GPUs are announced and brought to market to get something not priced into the stratosphere. Hopefully the mobile versions of Nvidia’s new cards won’t be saddled some of the problems that have hit its latest desktop class, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">mediocre improvements over their last-gen counterparts</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609920/rtx-5090-melting-power-connector-current-distribution">power issues</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">manufacturing missteps</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619414/samsung-9100-pro-gen-5-pcie-ssd-specs-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/quentyn-kennemer">Quentyn Kennemer</a> <span>is a writer who helps The Verge’s readers save money by surfacing the best tech deals and presenting the latest product recommendations from our experts. He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first PCIe Gen 5 SSDs from the likes of Seagate and Crucial began hitting the market nearly two years ago, but Samsung has been notably absent with its own model. That will change in March with the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-announces-9100-pro-series-ssds-with-breakthrough-pcie-5-0-performance/">arrival of the Samsung 9100 Pro series</a>, its first consumer-ready pure PCIe Gen 5 SSD built with NVMe 2.0. At launch, it will be available in 1TB (starting at $199.99), 2TB ($299.99), and 4TB ($549.99) capacities in an M.2 form factor, with or without heatsinks. An 8TB configuration, a first for Samsung NVMe SSDs, is slated for the second half of 2025.</p><p>By the numbers, the 9100 Pro’s theoretical maximum random read and write speeds — 2,200K and 2,600K input-output operations per second (IOPS) — are at least twice as fast as the last-gen Samsung 980 Pro, a PCIe Gen4 SSD. Our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743546/pcie-gen-5-ssd-nvme-drive-speed-test-comparison-hands-on">earliest comparison of that SSD</a> with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0BX4HGFGV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Seagate’s Firecuda 540</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-T700-Gen5-NVMe-CT1000T700SSD3/dp/B0C3K1QBSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Crucial’s T700</a> showed no noticeable benefits for PC gaming; however, the difference may be more evident for heavier computing workflows. If nothing else, it’d be nice to know you’re future-proofed, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879732/pcie-6-0-final-specification-bandwidth-speeds">until PCIe Gen 6 arrives</a>.</p><p>The gains might be more apparent if you’re talking about large-volume file transfers, though, which videographers or software engineers working with large datasets might appreciate. Samsung says the 9100 Pro (built on its V Nand TLC V8 with a custom controller) can reach sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8GBps and 13.4GBps, respectively. That’s roughly double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price">last-gen 980 Pro</a>, and about 2-3GBps per second faster than the earliest PCIe 5 SSDs can manage.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
