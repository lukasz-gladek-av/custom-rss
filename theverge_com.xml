Former Wildlight level designer Alex Graner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?originTrackingId=%2FqMD4ALWpJvcsmxWmoXMGw%3D%3D">says that</a> “most of the team at Wildlight” was laid off today, which was backed up by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427498373676597248/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIV1iYBHi7OPybalzIKilWBO4bTY5vJb8c">former lead tech artist Josh Sobel</a>.</p><p>”Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” <a href="https://x.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450">Wildlight says in a statement</a>. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”</p><p><em>Highguard</em> was first announced as the final reveal at The Game Awards in December with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_6tjMvckZ0">a splashy reveal trailer</a> promoting a January 26th launch date. The game reportedly hit nearly 100,000 concurrent players <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/highguard-manages-almost-100k-steam-players-on-day-one-amidst-over-13k-negative-reviews/">on Steam on launch day</a>, but it has a “Mixed” rating on the platform and has just over 2,400 concurrent players as of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. The game launched with three-player teams, but shortly after, Wildlight added a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/871297/that-was-fast">limited time 5v5 mode</a> that it made permanent <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412">a few days later</a>.</p><p>This week, Riot Games also made cuts on a major live service project, laying off about 80 people from its recently-launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/876038/riot-games-2xko-layoffs-job-cuts-league-of-legends"><em>2XKO</em> fighting game</a> set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe.</p><p><em><strong>Update, February 11th</strong>: Added statement from Wildlight.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/877674/highguard-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
