Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo’s Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>“Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,” Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p>That success is driving a 132 percent surge in quarterly revenue, which increased to ¥572.3 billion (around $3.8 billion) between April-June, compared to ¥246.6 billion (around $1.6 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo says it’s still forecasting to hit 15 million Switch 2 sales by the end of its 2026 financial year, despite uncertainties like Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">White House announced</a> that a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam — where Nintendo produces its Switch 2 consoles — will begin next week. That’s double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">10 percent baseline tariff</a> introduced in April that Nintendo used to forecast earnings for the current fiscal year.</p><p>“While there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the US tariff measures, at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year,” <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo said</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2’s popularity at launch has made it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console</a> of all time. Meanwhile, people are still purchasing the first Switch console, which has now hit 153.1 million units in lifetime sales — inching closer to dethroning the DS as Nintendo’s most successful console, which sold 154.02 million units. The Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales]]></content:encoded>
