In the game, you play as Jodie (portrayed by Page), and sometimes as a supernatural entity called Aiden to whom she is somehow connected. I haven’t played the game myself, but if you want to get a general idea of what it’s about, you can read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814072/beyond-two-souls-review">Sean Hollister’s review of its debut</a> on the PlayStation 3 in 2013.</p><div><p>“Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career,” Page says in a statement to <em>Deadline</em>. “The story’s rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers.”</p><p>There’s no potential release date for the TV adaptation yet and no word on where it might air.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
