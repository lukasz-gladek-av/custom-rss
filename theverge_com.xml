The developer announced a sequel to <em>Okami</em>, a beautiful and beloved action-adventure game that originally launched back in 2006.</p><p>The sequel — which doesn’t currently have a name — was revealed in dramatic fashion with a musical performance. Original director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23914228/hideki-kamiya-bayonetta-platinum-games-retiring-youtube">Hideki Kamiya</a> is returning for the game, which will be developed by his new studio Clovers. It’s still very early though; during the reveal TGA host Geoff Keighley said that “production is about to begin.” Capcom, meanwhile, says only that “a new adventure in the same vein as <em>Okami</em> has been set in motion.”</p><p>Not only has it been quite some time since <em>Okami</em> debuted, its announcement also comes at a time when Capcom seems intent on doubling down on its biggest franchises. Right now that means a lot of <em>Monster Hunter</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em>. Up next is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167998/monster-hunter-wilds-date-trailer"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, which is launching next year, as well as the mobile spinoff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"><em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>.</p><div><p>However, Okami isn’t the only Capcom franchise being revived: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody">the company also revealed a new entry in the action franchise <em>Onimusha</em></a>, which is launching in 2026. Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOiJGLZDnFw">the very bloody debut trailer </a>for that.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements"><h2>The Game Awards 2024: all of the biggest trailers and announcements</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319585/youtube-tv-2024-subscription-price-increase-82-99"><h2>YouTube TV’s monthly cost soars to $82.99</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model"><h2>Google launched Gemini 2.0, its new AI model for practically everything</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24318840/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji-image-playground"><h2>With iOS 18.2, Apple completes its AI starter kit</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses"><h2>I saw Google’s plan to put Android on your face</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
