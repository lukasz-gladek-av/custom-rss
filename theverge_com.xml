The featured artist for the season is rumored to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13285044/hatsune-miku-vr-future-live-playstation-vr">virtual pop star Hatsune Miku</a> — and Epic Games is has already <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877717137499869270">dropped a hint</a> that she might be joining <em>Fortnite</em> soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
