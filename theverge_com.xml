            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sure enough, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s exciting Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT graphic card prices, quoted at $550/$600</a>, are looking too good to be true. Newegg, Overclockers UK, and even Micro Center are among the outlets that have now quietly raised the prices on the <em>supposedly</em> entry-level MSRP models of these graphics cards by $50-$130. Last Thursday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch">AMD wouldn’t deny reports</a> that its partners are explicitly allowed to rapidly increase those prices beyond MSRP, and a week later, that’s already coming to pass.</p><p>While it’s true that board partners like ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX generally charge more for cards with fancier cooling solutions, those aren’t the cards we’re talking about today. We’ve been tracking prices on ten specific models of the AMD 9070 and AMD 9070 XT that were originally introduced at their $550 and $600 MSRPs.</p><p>None of those cards are currently in stock at any retailer we’ve checked — but some retailers have already modified their pricetags ahead of new shipments. Here are the changes we’ve seen:</p><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070-xt"><h2>AMD Radeon 9070 XT</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Newegg now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper at $700, a $100 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists XFX’s 9070 XT Swift at at $730, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at $670, a $70 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper and Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT at £650, an £80 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at £669, a £99 jump</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070"><h2><strong>AMD Radeon 9070</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Micro Center now lists XFX’s 9070 Swift OC at $630, an $80 jump</span></li><li><span>Micro Center now lists Gigabyte’s 9070 Gaming OC at $670, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 Reaper at £570, a £40 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists Sapphire’s Pulse 9070 at £570, a £40 jump</span></li></ul></div><p>Not every retailer has changed out the pricetags on every card. Best Buy, which only listed a single model of the 9070 and 9070 XT at MSRP to begin with, hasn’t changed those prices yet — though they’re admittedly still out of stock. (It also now lists a pair of out-of-stock Gigabyte cards at MSRP.) Micro Center also still lists three models of 9070 and four models of 9070 XT at MSRP, though all are out of stock.</p><p>On the Nvidia front, there doesn’t seem to be much retailer/board partner scalping going on yet, at least at major US retailers. We’re tracking six different models of $550 RTX 5070, three different models of $750 RTX 5070 Ti, and three different models of $1,000 RTX 5080 which were originally listed at MSRP prices. Best Buy, Newegg, and Micro Center are still listing the ones they stock at MSRP today.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch#:~:text=It%20did%20address%20the%20larger%20question">AMD told us</a> that “we expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599,” and that more cards are coming. AMD did not say which board partners or retailers would agree to offer cards at those prices, or how few those partners would have to sell at those prices before charging more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
