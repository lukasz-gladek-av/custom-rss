            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> <span>is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As always, the most important Nvidia graphics card is the one you can actually buy, and Nvidia’s talked a big game for its RTX 5070, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">making the dubious but nuanced claim</a> it can deliver RTX 4090 performance for just $549. On February 28th, AMD will get its chance to intercept with the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612375/amd-will-reveal-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-february-28th">in a streaming event it just announced today</a>. But Nvidia has now made its own wiggle room, delaying the launch of the RTX 5070 from February to March 5th, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5070-family%2F" rel="sponsored">its product page reveals today</a>.</p><p>Nvidia will ship its $749 RTX 5070 Ti ahead of AMD’s event, though, on February 20th, a week from today.</p><p>AMD has telegraphed that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">won’t be competing</a> with Nvidia’s latest and greatest cards, so price is the one big lever that AMD can potentially pull in order to compete. (The AMD Radeon 9070 cards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025#:~:text=in%20a%20branding%20slide%20for%20RDNA%204%2C%20AMD%20appears%20to%20suggest%20the%209070%20series%20will%20offer%20similar%20performance%20to%20the%20Nvidia%20GeForce%20RTX%204070%20Ti%20and%20RTX%204070%20Super.">appeared to be targeting</a> Nvidia 4070 Ti and 4070 Super levels of performance, not necessarily higher.) But Nvidia, a company that can now make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301811/nvidia-just-made-nearly-20-billion-in-pure-profit-in-a-single-quarter">$20 billion in pure profit in a single quarter</a>, could theoretically counter that if it feels it needs to, and now has more room to do so.</p><p>All that said, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-reportedly-working-on-gaming-radeon-rx-9000-gpu-with-32gb-memory">there is a rumor</a> that AMD may be working on a more potent card than its already-announced RX 9070 and 9070 XT, one with 32GB of RAM. AMD gaming marketing boss <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1890123828367601764">Frank Azor says</a> the 9070 XT won’t be a 32GB card, but did not address the larger rumor.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
