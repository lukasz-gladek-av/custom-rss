But the movie’s latest trailer makes it pretty clear that this isn’t just going to be a one-to-one translation.</p></div><p>Similar to the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/16/world-premiere-of-the-until-dawn-movie-trailer/">director David F. Sandberg’s <em>Until Dawn</em></a><em> </em>revolves around a group of people who find themselves trapped in a time loop that resets as they’re each murdered in a number of different horrific scenarios. When Melanie (Maia Mitchell) goes missing under mysterious circumstances, her younger sister Clover (Ella Rubin) recruits her friends Max (Michael Cimino), Megan (Ji-young Yoo), Nina (Odessa A’zion), and Abel (Belmont Cameli) on a mission to find her. In the trailer, group’s search brings them to what looks to be an inn run by Hill (Peter Stormare), an odd man who warns them that wandering farther up the road will only bring trouble into their lives.</p><p>Though one seems all that bothered by how the weather acts strangely around Hill’s inn, they know something is up when their car vanishes, and they find Melanie’s signature written in a dusty old guest log. Things only get spookier as night falls, and <em>something </em>starts lurking in the darkness around Clover and her friends. But it isn’t until people start dying that they realize they’re somehow being resurrected and challenged to survive until the morning as various ghouls try to kill them in inventive ways. </p><p>The trailer makes it seem like, despite revolving around new characters, it’ll hit many of the classic <em>Until Dawn </em>beats<em>. </em>And when the movie hits theaters on April 25th, it’ll probably keep audiences guessing as to who exactly is going to make it out alive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
