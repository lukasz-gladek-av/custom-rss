            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The Game Awards are back once again to showcase a metric ton of commercials, provide the gaming public with their monthly dose of Muppets, and validate gamers’ opinions on which title should be named the Game of the Year. I don’t wanna say it’s a foregone conclusion what this year’s GOTY will be — <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a> </em>may surprise us — but it’s pretty obvious that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em> is the frontrunner and for good reason. It’s netted 12 nominations, the most out of this year’s contenders, including all five craft awards (Direction, Art, Music and Score, Narrative, and Audio Design).</p><p>On the announcements side, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Games are planning something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-will-be-at-the-game-awards-this-week">related to the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. Keighley also probably had plans to reveal big news about <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/playstation-accidentally-leaks-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem/">it got spoiled early</a> thanks to some leaked key art on the PlayStation Store. Here’s all the news, announcements, and trailers from The Game Awards 2025.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Badger, badger, badger.</p><p>If there’s one thing these video game streets need is a good old-fashioned mascot platformer. <em>Bradley The Badger</em> is a mascot that seems to know he’s in a platforming game. In the trailer that debuted during The Game Awards pre-show, he’s transported from his colorful world to one much less fun...then it gets weird.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s a dog herd sheep world out there.</p><p>The first announcement of the night was extremely adorable with <em>The Free Shepherd</em>, which is launching on the PS5 and Steam in 2027. If you’re looking for some herding action in the meantime, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/764810/herdling-panic-review-pc-switch-playstation-xbox">be sure to check out <em>Herdling</em></a>.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Catfish and Crouton are goin’ on the road.</p><p>Ahead of The Game Awards, Compulsion Games has announced that<em> South of Midnight</em> is going multi-platform. The southern gothic action-adventure game, first released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games">on Xbox earlier this year</a>, is coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2 in spring 2026. Come for the incredibly cool southern folklore inspired narrative, but stay for your adorable companion Crouton and the yarn-spinnin’ Catfish.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s almost that time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">The shine may be wearing off The Game Awards</a>, but the show is still often worth a watch if you like catching the latest game reveals. This year’s edition kicks off at 8PM ET, with a pre-show airing 30 minutes before that.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODQxNzEw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">The Game Awards are losing their luster</a></h2><div><p>It’s Game Awards season, y’all. That special time of the year when we gather together to celebrate video games and the people who make them… by watching expensive commercials briefly punctuated by the odd awards speech or musical performance. For better or worse, The Game Awards is the biggest night on the video game event calendar. But with the way things have been going, lately it’s been more “worse” than it has been “better.”</p><p>Between host and industry hypeman Geoff Keighley’s two video game vanity projects, The Game Awards is older and ostensibly more mature than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">Summer Game Fest</a>. Conceived in 2014 as a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot">celebrate both the people who make and play games,</a> the show has always been part awards ceremony, part commercial product. That idea has been executed with varying degrees of success. (Remember the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/12/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-cringeworthy-of-the-2016-game-awards/">Schick Hydrobot</a>?) But for the last few years, it’s felt like the awards part was increasingly getting in the way of the commercial part.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s Expedition 33 vs. the world.</p><p>The Game Awards’ Game of the Year nominees <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1990467468436050379">are out</a>: <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Hades II</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. <em>Expedition 33</em> got 12 nominations, the most <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990471331893416105">“in TGA history.“</a></p><p>The show takes place on December 11th.</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Apple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.</p><p>That <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April ruling</a> from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">a 2021 order</a> allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26372151-epic-v-apple-appeals-court-opinion/">today’s opinion</a>, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.</p><p>Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”</p><p>But the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting <em>any </em>fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.</p><p>The panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”</p><p>The opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”</p><p>Apple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from <a href="https://x.com/business/status/1999209253131759821"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/schaeffers/status/1999214579956809906">Schaeffer’s Investment Research</a> about the ruling.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/842991/apple-epic-appeal-loses-contempt]]></content:encoded>
