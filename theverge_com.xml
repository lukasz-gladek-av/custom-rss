            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has added a new performance monitor to Steam that can help you understand why a game may or may not be running smoothly. Not only does it break out a game’s overall frame rate, it can tell you how many of those frames were generated by techniques like Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500576552635859540?utm_source=SteamDB">according to a post</a>.</p><p>The change is included as part of an update to the Steam Client that’s available now, though Valve notes that this “first version” focuses on “Windows users and on the most common GPU hardware.”</p><p>The company says the new performance monitor currently offers up to four different levels of detail: a single FPS value, FPS details, CPU and GPU utilization, and “FPS, CPU, GPU &amp; RAM Full Details.” The more you choose to show, the more of your screen will be taken up by the performance monitor.</p><p>Steam previously offered a simple FPS counter, but separating out generated frames from the frames fully rendered by your graphics cores can help you better understand key differences between what you see and how a game feels. “Frame generation can’t help with things like input latency that matter to competitive gamers, but it can make things look visually smoother on today’s high refresh rate monitors,” Valve says <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767">in a detailed support document</a> about the performance monitor. </p><p>In practice, what that should mean is that you can see whether your game feels like it’s running at just 30 fps because it actually is running at 30 fps inside the game engine, even though you’re seeing a visually smoother image due to Nvidia and AMD’s added “fake frames.” (It’s a whole debate in the PC gaming community, and it appears Valve isn’t taking sides here.) </p><p>Valve has already given handheld gamers a taste of these quick insights by building tools <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud">like MangoHud </a>into the Steam Deck and SteamOS, which similarly let you monitor your CPU, graphics, RAM, and carefully ration out your battery life. But having a way to do so built into desktop Steam will make the insights much more accessible to many more gamers.</p><p>Valve says that it has plans to “add some additional pieces of data to the performance overlay going forward, to detect certain common bad hardware performance scenarios, and to show a larger summary of your game’s performance in the overlay itself when you hit shift-tab.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695543/valve-steam-performance-monitor-frame-generation-frame-rates]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A glass screen protector is one of a few “set it and forget it” purchases that every Switch 2 owner should make, along with buying a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">microSD Express card</a> and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/691319/best-switch-2-cases">protective case</a> for the console. In fact, it should be a priority to stick one onto the console’s screen as soon as possible to avoid accidental scratches. </p><p>I’ve been installing and removing Switch 2 screen protectors to test others on my console at an alarming rate, more than any sane person should, and here are the most important takeaways:</p><div><ul><li><span>Do not buy a flimsy plastic screen protector. They won’t protect your Switch 2 enough.</span></li><li><span>It’s impossible to tell different brands’ protectors apart once they’re on your screen; product packaging and the installation process are the biggest differences (as well as the key factors that increase cost).</span></li><li><span>Some protectors are glossy and some are anti-reflective, each with its own tradeoffs. For my money, glossy is the way to go. The matte finish looks good, but it reduces the screen’s vivid quality and its viewing angles.</span></li></ul></div><p>Of the options below, it’s easiest to recommend <strong>amFilm’s three-pack of glossy screen protectors</strong>. Not only is the pack incredibly affordable ($7.19 from <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Installation-Transparent-Accessories-Anti-Scratch-SWTCH2-7-9/dp/B0DS73N83B/ref=sr_1_1?crid=231EBG3UY5Q1Y&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JMr6OSZhN-me8fKx8Im9R7U5j4AtUW8FmAj8fOrmMVp_kd7IaANV23xirhpm-Nu3u-IW9iIW7MNKWLynDfeCvTM2LeTAqiwbCro0UMaMS5CO4mvnbSCGtxMxuaMqvAZXGtL2vxQlcWcs5Fkgaa1I2ZKVRowy8OLW-Wax7noSoOMqPYLkUO3_7nsVKhEqEfF6M9s17fsV_zGG7C56ySqBsYVn15FHF4z6XBZwn9q2mf4ZfMiNLS2t3-hVQAqp9kyDNUcMHg7duxH_HIS8GqbcYDIlf69VsTAA2fMFoFGokFQ.yZ4lHneAbW6omJP3ynK2hf1RHRN3D5G-yXRBUxDOPHg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1751290880&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=amfilm%2Bswitch%2B2%2Celectronics%2C78&amp;sr=1-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> at the time of publication), but the tray also allows for perfect alignment of the glass protector for easy, bubble-free installation. I’ve used this company’s screen protectors on various gadgets for years, and I particularly like its glossy option over the matte finish, since it lets the Switch 2’s screen fully shine through.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption>Here’s what the Switch 2 looks like with a glossy screen protector.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><div><h2>What I’m looking for in a Switch 2 screen protector</h2><section><p>The only way to test a screen protector is to go through the installation process for each option. We use the tools included to ensure a proper installation, analyze the fit and finish, and then remove it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677944/nintendo-switch-2-screen-protector-anti-scattering-film-cover">very, <em>very </em>carefully</a> to proceed with the next candidate.</p></section><section><p>Every screen protector we mention in this buying guide comes with more than one (sometimes three!), which is good because they can sometimes break in the line of duty. We’ll note how many you get with your purchase, as well as what tools are included to make the installation process simpler.</p></section><section><p>All of the protectors in this buying guide claim to be a 9 on the Mohs hardness scale, meaning they should be tough to crack. I don’t put those particular claims to the test because I’m using my personal Switch 2, paid for with my money. Also, all models included feature an oleophobic coating to resist oils from fingerprints.</p></section><section><p>I’m ensuring that, during installation, screen protectors fit the entirety of the Switch 2’s screen, including its bezel. I haven’t encountered one yet during testing that doesn’t fit.</p></section></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->7</span></p><div><p>My go-to screen protector brand for years has been amFilm. Three glossy tempered glass sheets come in the box, and the tools make installation fairly simple. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZS0lty">JSAUX’s model</a> is just as good based on my testing, and just as affordable.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>In keeping up with some brands that offer faster installations, amFilm offers a two-pack of glossy protectors that includes a “OneTouch” tray. Remove the protector’s bottom film, attach the tray to your device, and then press gently on the protector until it’s fully applied.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->35</span></p><div><p>Dbrand’s Prism 2.0 includes two glass protectors for the Switch 2, each nestled into plastic cases that fit perfectly around the edges of the console (with the Joy-Con 2 removed). $34.99 is expensive for two protectors, but if simplicity and elegant packaging trump value, then this is a good option.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->20</span></p><div><p>Genki offers a cheaper alternative to Dbrand with the Aegis Shield. It includes two protectors, and the installation process is nearly identical: just align the plastic frame with the console, pull the tab, and run your finger across the exposed section of the frame. <a href="https://amzn.to/4nsWQ6R">Spigen makes a similar product</a> that costs $24.99 for a two-pack.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>Let’s start with one of the most affordable options if you want to go the matte-textured route. AmFilm sells a two-pack of protectors at Amazon for $8.99. The set includes a plastic frame that serves as a guide to align the protector just right. <a href="https://amzn.to/3G1DtBa">JSAUX</a> makes a similar product that’s the same price.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>AmFilm also sells a two-pack with a OneTouch frame for easier installation. Again, keep in mind that opting for matte over glossy will reduce glare, but at the cost of viewing angles as well as the full vivid quality of the Switch 2’s screen. That’ll be an acceptable tradeoff for some, but not all people.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/694948/best-switch-2-glass-screen-protector-glossy-matte]]></content:encoded>
