Sakhnini takes over on April 28th.

However, as I look at what is needed of Discord’s CEO over the next few years, I realize that it’s time for me to literally ‘hire myself out of a job.’”</p><p>When we interviewed Citron <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24134914/discord-ceo-gaming-chat-teens-safety-moderation-decoder-interview">on the <em>Decoder</em> podcast last year</a>, he said the company had grown to about 870 employees and over 200 million monthly active users.</p><p>Stanislav Vishnevskiy, Discord’s other co-founder, will remain at the company as chief technology officer.</p><p>“I look forward to working with Stan and Discord’s talented team to scale our business while staying true to the company’s core mission and the special connection it has with player communities,” Sakhnini says in a statement. “We’re still at the beginning of gaming’s impact on entertainment and culture, and Discord is perfectly positioned to play a central role in that future.”</p><p>The leadership shift is happening as Discord is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625025/discord-is-reportedly-exploring-an-ipo">reportedly exploring an IPO</a>.
