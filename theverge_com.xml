It’s priced at €129, or around $150, which is more than twice the price of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPEWoD0jhhq/">Lego’s $60 Game Boy</a> which the BrickBoy doesn’t include. Early backers can get it discounted to €99, or around $115, but that’s still far more expensive than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">many of Anbernic’s handheld emulators</a> that are far more capable and ready to play right out of the box.</p><p>The more capable BrickBoy Gamer Kit that adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, compatibility with Bluetooth headphones, and a rechargeable battery is €169, or around $197, without discounts. The Collector’s Edition that can turn the Lego Game Boy into a functional display piece running demos is €189, or around $220, and all versions are estimated to ship sometime in March 2026. That’s a lot to pay for a Game Boy replica with questionable ergonomics and controls, but since it relies on ROMs, the BrickBoy won’t require you to source original game carts like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic">Natalie the Nerd’s upgrade kit</a> will.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808051/brickboy-lego-game-boy-emulator-upgrade-kit-kickstarter]]></content:encoded>
