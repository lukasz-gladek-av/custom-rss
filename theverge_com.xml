            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283812/microsoft-q1-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s Q1 2025 earnings are in, and the results show that Microsoft’s software gaming revenues are way up even as Xbox hardware revenue is declining.</p><p>The company says that its Xbox content and services revenue grew 61 percent year over year from the previous quarter — a figure driven by “53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition,” according to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast">the company’s press release</a>. But hardware revenues again declined, down 29 percent this quarter, which may be influenced by Microsoft’s continued strategy to make its games available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">more widely than just Xbox consoles</a>.</p><p>During the quarter, Microsoft introduced its new Xbox Game Pass “Standard” tier and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">price hike</a> for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Q1 also saw the arrival of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24195537/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-modern-warfare-3">on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but this quarter doesn’t include the impact of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th">launched last week</a>.</p><p>The company’s Intelligent Cloud division was also a bright spot, with total revenues up 20 percent year over year to $24.1 billion driven by Azure. Azure and other cloud services revenue was up 33 percent, “including 12 points” from demand for its AI services. Productivity and Business Processes, which includes its Office products, was up 12 percent year over year to $28.3 billion in revenues. </p><p>Microsoft’s OEM and Devices revenue — which are now reported together — were up 2 percent. However, that figure was driven by “growth in Windows OEM” and “partially offset by a decline in Devices,” Microsoft says.</p><p>Microsoft, like many other companies, is investing heavily in AI-focused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246010/microsoft-copilot-pages-multiplayer-ai-business">features and tools</a> right now, especially to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254032/microsoft-copilot-news-presenter-notepad">improve Copilot</a>. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,” Satya Nadella, chair and CEO of Microsoft, says in a statement. “We are expanding our opportunity and winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms and tools to drive new growth and operating leverage.”</p><div><p>The company has also made security its top priority and released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251945/microsoft-security-report-secure-future-initiative">a report in Q1 about its efforts</a>. During the quarter, Microsoft also had to grapple with the effects of the Blue Screens of Death caused by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202527/crowdstrike-microsoft-windows-bsod-outage">the massive CrowdStrike outage</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283677/ubisoft-nft-game-champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-sequence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Ubisoft has quietly released its own NFT game to join the ranks of other vaunted, widely-played blockchain enabled titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23015468/axie-infinity-blockchain-nft-play-to-earn-game-economics-hack"><em>Axie Infinity</em></a> and...uh, <em>Ember Sword</em>. <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/"><em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em></a> launched earlier this month with relatively little fanfare or marketing. The game comes two years after Ubisoft’s failed bid <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23013346/ubisoft-ghost-recon-breakpoint-content-nft-digits-quartz">to make NFTs work in <em>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</em></a>, a solid three years after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616">NFT prices and purchases fell off a cliff,</a> and barely a week after it announced it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277630/ubisoft-ends-future-development-on-its-best-game-in-years">disband the team</a> behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>.</p></div><p>Surface level, <em>Champions Tactics</em> is a PC strategy game where players assemble teams of champions to fight their way up the rankings. Teams are composed of three champions, each with their own attributes and abilities that can exploit enemy teams’ weaknesses. At the beginning of each round, players roll dice to determine combat order. Next, they select abilities for their champions before combat plays out simultaneously. Rinse and repeat until one team is defeated. All in all, the game looks like a surprisingly decent, if generic, tactics game.</p><p>But then there’s all the NFT garbage. Champions are the game’s NFTs associated with the Oasys blockchain. To acquire champions you have to either forge them from existing champions you own or purchase them off the game’s marketplace. To purchase champions, you can either use the OAS cryptocurrency or plain ole cash money, with the cheapest going for about $7 and the most expensive sitting at an eye-watering $63,000 whole-ass American dollars. To understand what’s in it for Ubisoft to perpetrate this nonsense, the company takes a six percent “royalty fee” for every marketplace transaction, and there are about 2,700 active listings on the site.</p><p>But wait! There’s worse! Having more champions increases your VIP status. The higher your VIP status, the more experience points and in-game currency you earn, thus incentivizing players to spend money accumulating champions. To entice even more dollars out of customers, <em>Champions Tactics</em> also features an additional exclusive collection of NFTs to buy called warlords. According to the game’s website, owning a warlord unlocks access to “special events” and even more in-game boosts to earning EXP and gold. Players can use their warlords as their in-game profile pictures. Here’s what they look like.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Man, that sure is some compelling artwork selling for around $66.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div></div><p>Ubisoft is one of the biggest developers still apparently all-in on implementing blockchain technology within video games. In addition to trying and failing with NFTs in <em>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</em>, last year, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954067/guess-what-revolutionary-new-blockchain-tech-ubisoft-has-cooking">a strategic partnership</a> with web3 gaming platform Immutable after reports of Ubisoft employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-11/ubisoft-employees-push-back-hard-on-blockchain-initiative">internally criticizing the company’s blockchain projects</a>. The tragedy is that <em>Champions Tactics </em>seems like it has decent mechanics that’d work just fine as a mobile gacha game. Purchasing champions and forging new ones seems perfectly suited to take advantage of the kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case">microtransaction activity</a> gaming companies salivate over. This game doesn’t need NFTs to make the kind of money Ubisoft is after. </p><p>But what’s worst of all is that Ubisoft spent money developing a game with features that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled">gamers</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23562296/gdc-2023-survey-microsoft-blizzard-activision-nft-unionization">and developers actively hate</a>, only to push it out to essentially die in obscurity mere days after it essentially said “No, thanks” to the people who made one of its best games in <em>years.</em> Yikes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Comcast is boasting about what it’s calling its “biggest week in internet history,” which it pegs on <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>downloads and Thursday Night Football streams. The company says the <em>Call of Duty</em> game, which it released on October 25th, was responsible for a whopping 19 percent of its overall traffic last week.</p><p>It’s not really possible to quantify that further, given Comcast didn’t provide any specific numbers — either about how many customers were downloading the game or how big their downloads were. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6-file-size-explained/">Ranging between</a> 84.4GB for the PlayStation version and 102GB for the PC edition <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>is, in the grand tradition of <em>Call of Duty</em> games, a hefty download. It can be as much as 300GB if players choose to go ahead and download <em>Modern Warfare II </em>and <em>III</em> and all the associated content packs and languages, as Activision <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699">explained in June</a>.</p><p>Comcast bragging about its gigantic network traffic weekend in this way really underscores, if you scratch the surface a tad, just how restrictive its 1.2TB data cap can be in 2024. The company lifted that cap during the covid pandemic and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">delayed reinstating it multiple times</a>, but nevertheless brought it back in most US states. </p><p>The FCC, which says providers have the “technical ability” to operate without such limits, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">currently investigating</a> how they affect consumers. Whether the FCC can actually do anything about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24180118/supreme-court-chevron-deference-decision-opinion">is in question</a>.</p><p>For any players who did download the whole massive 300GB package, they’ll have wiped out a huge chunk of their 1.2TB Xfinity data cap in one fell swoop. If they used their internet as normal otherwise, that could put them right up against or even blow past that cap. Given that my family used nearly 800GB last month without any notably large game downloads, it wouldn’t be that hard at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
