But what if you don’t know what your giftee is into or simply want to give them more options? In that case, a gift card to their favorite bookstore or a subscription to something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=theverge02-20">Kindle Unlimited</a>, which grants members access to millions of ebooks and even select audiobooks, is a good idea. That said, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite alternatives below.</p><div><ul><li>For fans of Marvel and DC comics, as well as manga like <em>Fairy Tale</em>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/cu/signup/?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>Comixology</strong></a><strong> Unlimited subscription</strong> is perfect.
