            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em> had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://dogpilegame.com/">Dogpile</a></em> is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24049020/how-to-beat-suika-game-impossible/">Suika Game</a></em> by adding a <em>Balatro</em>-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like <em>Tetris</em>, and also like <em>Tetris</em>, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.</p><p>Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — <em>Dogpile</em> is match-3 <em>Tetris</em>, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that <a href="https://youtu.be/LiFz5J9DHig?si=gvuwe322wcDtZg4x&amp;t=23">like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled</a>.</p><p>Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of<em> Balatro</em> running throughout. Like <em>Balatro</em>, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like<em> Balatro</em>, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to <em>Balatro</em>’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.</p><p>Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most like <em>Balatro</em> and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloverpit-is-a-fun-not-gambling-roguelite-satire-of-capitalism-but-i-would-quite-like-us-to-stop-cashing-in-on-our-own-despair">well-intentioned, celebrated <em>Balatro</em>-likes</a> tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to <em>Balatro</em> are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push <em>Balatro</em>’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.</p><p>And yes, you can pet them.</p><p><sub><em>Dogpile</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848041/dogpile-review-inde-game-steam-balatro-puppies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even at $1,000, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">the Xbox Ally X handheld</a> didn’t ship with magnetic drift-resistant joysticks, and neither did the $600 model. But for an extra <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 at Amazon</a>, you can change that today — with officially Asus-approved and sanctioned TMR joysticks from Gulikit, the company that’s made a name for itself by supplying aftermarket drift-resistant sticks.</p><p>The company says it worked with Xbox Ally manufacturer Asus to create these sticks, that they’ll be “automatically recognized” when you swap them in, and that you can use the handheld’s built-in Armoury Crate app to calibrate them afterwards.</p><p>And while I haven’t tried these ones (I do have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">a pair in my Switch</a>), I can confirm it’s pretty easy to pop open the Xbox Ally to install. Just loosen the Philips-head screws, poke in a guitar pick pry tool to create a small gap, and pull a little harder than you think you need to pop open the clips. The joystick modules are right underneath. There’s nothing blocking you — just pop a ribbon cable and undo their three screws.</p><p>Here’s the company’s walkthrough in case you want to see for yourself — though I do not recommend taking sharp tweezers to ribbon cables when your fingernails can do that job safer and easier. (I may have broken a few ribbon cables in my life.)</p><p>When we’re talking about TMR or the older and slightly less power-efficient Hall effect joystick technology, I usually write “drift-resistant” instead of “drift-free” because you <em>may</em> find your center point drifting over time — but the beauty of magnetic is you just have to recalibrate! Unlike the potentiometer joysticks that ship with Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox controllers, you’re not scraping away material that’ll lead to permanent drift as you use the magnetic versions.</p><p>Gulikit’s new Xbox Ally sticks are <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 in the US today</a>, and should also be available in the UK for <em>£</em>20, and in Italy, France, and Spain for €22, this January.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848568/xbox-ally-gulikit-tmr-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Friend slop’ made co-op gaming goofier than ever in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1389040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a friend invited me to play a new game called <em>REPO</em> earlier this year, I thought I was wasting my money — not because the game looked bad, but because it looked like <em>Lethal Company</em>. The surprise-hit 2024 co-op survival horror game has players wander through unnerving ruined structures collecting trash while evading monsters. <em>Lethal Company</em> was popular with my friends (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040561/lethal-company-roblox-popularity-explained/">and just about everyone else</a>), but its eerie liminal spaces spooked me too much. My friends swore <em>REPO</em> was different, though, that it was so funny it was hard to be scared, especially with its goofy robot avatars — and they were right.</p><p><em>REPO</em> has become one of my favorite games, and was one of the biggest co-op titles of 2025, along with similar indie co-op hit <em>Peak</em>. Over the past several months, the two titles have become the faces of a new niche of games with a somewhat controversial name: “friend slop.”</p><p>The term usually refers to indie co-op games that are best experienced with friends and have an emphasis on humor. They’re typically PC games, cost less than $20, include proximity voice chat, feature wacky game physics, and often fall into the survival horror genre. Friend slop isn’t always scary, though. Some lighthearted flavors of “slop” popped up this year, like <em>Peak</em>, where you attempt to scale increasingly perilous mountains with your friends.</p><p>That’s just the tip — or rather, peak — of the friend slop iceberg. There’s also <em>Guilty as Sock!</em>, where you and your co-op buddies roleplay court showdowns as sock puppets. <em>Lockdown Protocol</em> takes inspiration from <em>Among Us</em>, a precursor to the friend slop trend, where one player attempts to sabotage their friends as they complete chores on a timer in a lonely base. <em>Mage Arena</em> is one of the cheapest friend slop games to arrive this year at just $2.99. It’s also one of the most unique — you compete in magic duels with your friends by verbally shouting spells.</p><p>Friend slop games tend to follow a similar formula: You and your friends need to accomplish something together, but the consequences for failure aren’t particularly intense (and it’s often funnier if you <em>don’t</em> succeed). <em>Peak</em> is a perfect example. I have yet to survive to the end of a run, and yet I keep playing. Winning <em>Peak</em> is great, but the most entertaining part is watching your friends miss a jump and fall off a mountain, eat poisonous food, or get chased down by the scoutmaster for running ahead.</p><p>In friend slop, the main objective is humor. Winning is secondary. If you’re hoping for a deep, nuanced plot, you’ll probably be disappointed. Friend slop games also tend to lose their charm when you’re playing solo. <em>REPO</em> just isn’t the same when there’s no one there to laugh every time you clumsily shatter a vase.</p><p>Therein lies one of the major criticisms of the genre and one of the reasons it’s been labeled “slop” to begin with. While <em>REPO</em> and <em>Peak</em> have been hugely popular this year, some say they’re just designed for viral, clippable moments and lack substance beyond that, partly because they’re not usually fun to play solo.</p><p>That could be a fair drawback depending on what you expect from these games. However, it misses the point of “friend slop” and overlooks a potential explanation for their popularity this year.</p><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> was also one of 2025’s biggest co-op games, and I’ve had a great time with it as well. However, it offers something completely different from <em>REPO</em> or <em>Peak</em> and feels drastically different to play, despite technically being under the same broad co-op umbrella. <em>Nightreign</em> requires concentration, skill, and strategy, whereas <em>REPO</em> mostly just requires you to keep an eye out for monsters while absentmindedly picking up junk. It’s also a much more affordable game than <em>Nightreign</em> and doesn’t hinge on any <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">prior knowledge of other games</a>.</p><p>That difference highlights one of friend slop’s greatest strengths. For all their arguable faults, friend slop games are approachable. They ask little of you — both in terms of money and time. You don’t even need a particularly powerful PC. These games are a way for people to hang out with friends for little money and laugh with each other. To some, myself included, that’s worth just as much as a rich story or dramatic boss fights.</p><p>This year, we’ve seen the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">prices of games soar</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">gaming PC hardware is becoming unaffordable</a> for many. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Almost everything about the hobby has become more expensive</a>. Friend slop games offer an oasis from that with low prices and low hardware requirements, staying accessible to a large swath of gamers, even more so because they’re typically easy to learn how to play. The very things that led some people to call these games “slop” are also part of what has made them so popular in 2025 in particular.</p><p>Paige Wilson, community manager at <em>Peak</em> publisher Aggro Crab, echoed that sentiment. “We actually think friend slop is a fire term,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “Sure, it started with the intention of [having] a negative connotation, but I think we always saw the term as funny and actually pretty accurate. It’s used to describe a low-cost game that you and your friends can pick up whenever, have some fun, hang out, and expect a bit of jank. I think some people might not view it as this, but we do!”</p><p>In other words, friend slop isn’t so much about the game as it is about the people you play it with. If that’s “slop,” then I’ll gladly embrace the “friend slop” label, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025]]></content:encoded>
