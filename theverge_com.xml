Sadly, it won’t arrive in time for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/819996/fallouts-new-season-two-trailer-brings-the-war-to-new-vegas">season two</a> premiere of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series that starts on December 17th, 2025.</p><p>It’s not the first time Bethesda has offered a replica of the chunky wrist-worn computer, but an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/10/16125156/fallout-4-pipboy-release-date-price">earlier version</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9655846/fallout-4-pip-boy-photo-gallery">bundled with a collector’s edition of <em>Fallout 4</em></a>, relied on a smartphone and an app to replicate its in-game functionality. Created in collaboration with The Wand Company — which has a solid track record for creating detailed and mostly functional replicas like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw">Poké Balls</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/11/8933329/star-trek-tos-bluetooth-communicator-hands-on-sdcc-2015"><em>Star Trek</em> Communicators</a> — the new Pip-Boy 3000 has its own 4-inch LCD display.</p><p>The Pip-Boy 3000’s screen can be toggled between the classic green UI seen in <em>Fallout 3</em> or the yellowish interface used in <em>New Vegas</em>. Bethesda says “almost all of the in-game content” accessible in both titles has been replicated including hundreds of menus that can be navigated with scroll wheels and dials, and you’ll even find a playable version of the <em>Atomic Command</em> minigame. The screen simulates the appearance of a vintage cathode-ray tube display with glitches and flickering effects that can be temporarily fixed by hitting the device, thanks to an accelerometer.</p><p>The replica’s front casing is made from die-cast metal while the body is injection-moulded plastic with a memory foam cuff that can be enlarged using an included spacer. Other functionality includes a flashlight, a headphone jack, an alarm clock mode that can be used alongside an included display stand, and a functional radiation detector. However, instead of measuring the dangerous fallout from a nuclear blast, the replica Pip-Boy 3000 measures the radiation of FM radio broadcasts using on-screen meters and the simulated sounds of a geiger counter.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/825283/bethesda-wand-company-fallout-3-new-vegas-pip-boy-3000-replica]]></content:encoded>
