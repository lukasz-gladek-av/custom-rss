            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/663084/lenovo-legion-9i-18-rtx-5090-2d-3d-gaming-laptop-announcement-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lenovo is announcing a new 10th-generation Legion 9i gaming laptop coming soon to China and scheduled for the fall in North America. The 18-inch behemoth is packed with top-end specs, including the option for a 4K-capable 2D / 3D screen, Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, up to 192GB of RAM, and 8TB of SSD storage.</p><p>How much will an over-the-top configuration like that cost? Nobody can say, as Lenovo isn’t talking pricing at all yet — not even the starting price for the base model with a 4K, non-3D screen. But when the time comes you won’t have to rely solely on Lenovo to build the configuration to your liking, as the four RAM slots and four SSD slots are user-accessible.</p><p>The optional 2D / 3D LCD can display 3840 x 2400 resolution at up to 240Hz in 2D mode or 1920 x 1200 in 3D mode. The screen also has a dual mode akin to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi">Razer Blade 18</a>, allowing up to an ultra-fast 440Hz when displaying 2D content in 1920 x 1080. Viewing 3D content on the Legion 9i’s screen doesn’t require glasses, as it uses eye-tracking and a lenticular lens array to appear 3D to the naked eye. Lenovo says the Legion 9i is designed for game developers, visual artists, and 3D professionals as well as spendy gamers. In addition to displaying 3D content and renders, Lenovo says its software supports 30 games playable in 3D. We have reached out to Lenovo for a list of compatible games, but did not receive an answer by time of publication.</p><p>As you’d expect from a desktop replacement-class laptop, the Legion 9i has a bunch of ports, including two Thunderbolt 5 ports, four USB 3.2 Gen 2 (three Type-A and one Type-C), an ethernet port, HDMI 2.1, and even a full-size SD card slot. For connectivity, it’s got Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. If you go for the 2D screen the 5-megapixel webcam has an f/2 aperture, though the 3D screen option comes with a faster f/1.6 lens — and both webcams feature a kill switch on the side of the laptop for privacy.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>If only the whole laptop could be decked out in this carbon fiber</em>.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Lenovo</cite></span></p></section><p>The laptop itself has a pretty unique look thanks to its carbon fiber lid. Lenovo says each Legion 9i’s lid is made from eight layers of carbon fiber, making it “lighter and stronger than aluminum.” But any weight savings aside, the coolest aspect of this carbon fiber creation is the visible pattern on the lid — which Lenovo says is slightly different and one-of-a-kind on each unit.</p><p>We may not know how much the Legion 9i costs just yet, but that lid instantly makes it one of the most interesting jumbo-sized gaming laptops in my book. At least, as far as ones not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">adorned with dragons</a> go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/663130/nintendo-switch-2-sales-forecast-15-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dominic-preston">Dominic Preston</a> <span>is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has forecast global sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles by the end of March 2026, which would be roughly comparable to the original Switch’s first year on sale, despite retailing for a much higher price. The company suffered an expected slump in both hardware and software sales this year, according to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf">latest earnings release</a>, and will be hoping for a bumper year ahead.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5th, so will have 10 months on sale to hit that forecast, with Nintendo also expecting to sell 45 million Switch 2 games in the same period. It’s not written its older console off though, and is expecting to shift another 4.5 million Switch consoles and over 100 million games in the year ahead, down from 10.8 million and 155 million of each last year.</p><p>The first Switch launched in March 2017, at the tail end of a fiscal year, so direct sales comparisons are tricky. It <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 17.79 million units worldwide</a> in its first 13 months on sale — comfortably more than Nintendo’s forecasts at the time — so Nintendo is expecting sales in the same ballpark this time around. The Switch has sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to overtaking the DS</a> as Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>Nintendo might be hedging its Switch 2 sales estimate, however, given the uncertainties with tariffs in the all-important US market. We’ve already seen that Switch 2 demand is higher than the company may have expected, despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">widespread complaints about the $449.99 price tag</a>. When US preorders finally began — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed in the wake of Trump’s tariffs</a>, amid fears that the price would climb even higher — they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">sold out almost immediately</a>. Meanwhile the company put out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">supply warning in Japan</a> after receiving 2.2 million applications for preorders, which Nintendo said “far exceeds our expectations.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
