            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount. There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom, or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.</p><div><p id="FXxWVp"><h2>The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2></p></div><div><p id="268sW3"><h3>Samsung Q8F</h3></p></div><p><strong>Samsung’s Q8F</strong> is available for $697.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVPQZRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-55-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617399.p%3FskuId%3D6617399" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for the 55-inch model, which is its lowest price ever and an excellent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.</p><p>The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $200 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,797.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVQGMS9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-85-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617395.p%3FskuId%3D6617395" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->698</span></p><div><p>Samsung’s Q8F is an excellent all-around TV thanks to its 120Hz panel, wide color reproduction, and adaptive audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="tcl-qm7k"><h3>TCL QM7K</h3></p></div><p>If you want a 55-inch TV with a gorgeous and bright QD-Mini LED panel without spending over $1,000, the <strong>TCL’s QM7K</strong> is the set to get. It’s currently available for around $748 (originally $1199.99) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-65-Inch-QD-Mini-Premium-Mini-LED/dp/B0DVWXXRDL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and<a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-55-class-qm7k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2F6621468.p%3FskuId%3D6621468" rel="sponsored"> Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price ever. It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.</p><p>The TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at <em><a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm7k#:~:text=TCL%2065QM7K-,966,-288">RTINGS</a></em> found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang &amp; Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system. You can get a 75-inch model for around $1,299.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-65-Inch-QD-Mini-Premium-Mini-LED/dp/B0DVX9RF7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-75-class-qm7k-series-4k-uhd-hdr-qd-mini-led-smart-tv-with-google-tv-2025%2F6621474.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> if you need a bigger screen.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->748</span></p><div><p>TCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="panasonic-z85"><h3>Panasonic Z85</h3></p></div><p>We have a dedicated section for high-end OLED TV deals below, but <strong>Panasonic’s Z85</strong> is such a good value that it deserves consideration for folks who may be on a budget.

The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.</p><p>The 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time. The TV’s audio system features a built-in subwoofer for enhanced bass. The Z85 runs FireOS, Amazon’s entertainment-focused OS, so you have the option to use many functions by asking Alexa via its voice-enabled remote. A 55-inch model of the Z85 is also available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Newest-55-inch-Adaptive-Refresh/dp/B0D97GB5HM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> for $897.99.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->898</span></p><div><p>Panasonic’s Z85 is an incredibly good value for an OLED TV at its size.

The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs FireOS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can step up to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-43-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBLZYY5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">50-inch model</a> for $259.99 ($140 off), or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-43-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">55-inch model</a> for $339 ($120 off), if you like its modest feature set but want a larger screen.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->220</span></p><div><p>Amazon’s 4-Series TV boasts solid specs, including HDR10 support, making it an extremely affordable option regardless of the chosen size.</p></div></div><div><p id="hisense-qd7"><h3>Hisense QD7</h3></p></div><p>If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch <strong>Hisense QD7</strong> has a lot to offer for its current sale price of $399.99 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Class-Mini-LED-Smart-55QD7QF/dp/B0DYVXN9HT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhisense-55-class-qd7-series-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-fire-tv-2025%2F6621483.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (<a href="https://youtu.be/tjUZmaMRwtQ">this video</a> from LG shows how it works, but lower your volume first), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $499 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Class-Mini-LED-Smart-55QD7QF/dp/B0DYVXN9HT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->400</span></p><div><p>The QD7 has a QLED panel that can display over a billion colors and supports multiple HDR formats.

The 55-inch model received its first price drop to around $2,296.99 ($203 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1885601-REG%2Flg_oled55g5wua_oled_evo_ai_g5.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Upscaling-Filmmaker-Orchestra-OLED65G5WUA/dp/B0DYQGRHX3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. LG claims that the 4K TV’s OLED panel offers a 33 percent jump in brightness over its predecessor. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, with support for Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, plus a near-instantaneous 0.1ms response time, and fast gaming at 165Hz with VRR available on all four of its HDMI ports. The G5 can also play games via the cloud with the Xbox app.</p><p>The TV’s Alpha 11 4K AI Processor enables AI Picture Pro to manage the brightness, depth, and clarity of every frame, and it will automatically upscale non-4K video. The G5’s audio system features five up-firing speakers, providing more sophisticated surround sound than most TVs can provide. LG’s G5 is a luxe TV with great specs that will likely remain on the cutting edge of screen tech for the next few years. LG offers a 65-inch model that’s on sale for around $3,196.99 ($203 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1885603-REG%2Flg_oled65g5wua_oled_evo_ai_g5.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-g5-series-oled-evo-ai-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-with-one-wall-design-2025%2F6621810.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2297</span></p><div><p>The LG G5 is a top-of-the-line OLED TV with perfect contrast, a powerful AI processor, a 120Hz refresh rate, 4,000 nits maximum brightness, support for Nvidia G-Force, AMD FreeSync Premium, and a .1ms response time.</p></div></div><div><p id="sony-a90k"><h3>LG C4 OLED</h3></p></div><p>The<strong> LG C4</strong> is the company’s 2024 best all-around OLED TV, and the 65-inch model currently on sale for around $1,296.99 ($304 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1812659-REG%2Flg_oled65c4pua_evo_c4_65_4k.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024%2F6578042.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Like the G5, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and G5 is its maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, though that will vary depending on the content you’re watching. It has a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. The LG C4 shares many of the same core features as the G5, but at nearly $1,000 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for around $2,196 ($1300 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1812662-REG%2Flg_oled77c4pua_evo_c4_77_4k.html" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-77-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024%2F6578044.p%3FskuId%3D6578044" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1297</span></p><div><p>LG’s C4 has the same refresh rate and gaming-centric features, with a fast AI-enabled processor and perfect contrast on its OLED panel.</p></div></div><div><p id="lg-b4"><h3>LG B4</h3></p></div><p>If you love playing games or watching movies, but don’t have space for a massive OLED TV, <strong>LG’s B4</strong> is 48 inches and down to just $599 ($100 off) at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024%2F6584787.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. It features a 120Hz panel with support for AMD FreeSync Premium, Nvidia G-Sync, VRR gaming, and a 0.1ms response time just like the premium C4. The 4K set has an a8 AI Processor 4K that’ll upscale non-4K video and optimize video and audio quality better than its predecessor, though not as well as the chips in LG’s higher-end TV models. The B4 also has LG’s Gallery Mode for displaying photos or paintings when you’re not actively using it. If you’ve never tried an OLED TV before, LG’s B4 is an excellent choice at its current sale price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As the esports industry searches for new sources of revenue, Riot Games has <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">opened up its <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> esports leagues to sports betting sponsorships</a>. The decision will permit tier one organizations – or the highest level of professional players – in the North and South America and European esports leagues of <em>Valorant</em> and <em>LoL</em> to secure paid sponsorships from sports betting companies, a previously prohibited category of sponsor.</p><p>According to Riot, the reason for this change is because it’s what the players and esports organizations have been asking for. “We agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams,” wrote John Needham, president of publishing and esports at Riot Games.</p><p>There was a time in esports history when sponsorship dollars flowed in, generating lots of revenue for game publishers and enabling organizations to pay players salaries in the millions of dollars. Esports was seen as an investment vehicle, with media corporations and even traditional sports companies investing their dollars in hopes of capitalizing on what was then an untapped but steadily growing market. One of the most famous examples, Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League, <a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/19347153/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms">sold franchise slots for tens of millions of dollars</a> to investors like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Comcast.</p><p>But the comparatively small revenue these leagues generate in conjunction with the high costs to run them, combined with the general economic downturn of the covid-19 pandemic, meant that companies could not get a return on their investments and began pulling their money out. It’s forced esports organizations and esports game publishers alike to find new ways to pay players and staff or risk shuttering entirely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954005/overwatch-league-shuts-down-activision-blizzard">as the Overwatch League has</a>. </p><p>Over the last few years, Riot has changed how its esports leagues have worked to better weather what’s being called the “esports winter” or general contraction of the esports industry. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970110/the-lcs-is-shrinking"><em>LoL</em> league ecosystem has gotten smaller</a>, thereby eliminating some teams’ financial burden of participating (it costs $10 million dollars to have a slot) while also reducing Riot’s financial responsibilities via its revenue sharing agreement with partnered teams. The addition of new categories of sponsors is the company’s latest attempt to bring sustainability to its corner of the struggling esports scene.</p><div><p>And sports betting companies are well-poised to fill that funding gap. While gambling sites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453321/overwatch-league-grand-finals-2022-dallas-fuel">aren’t the only game in town if your esport needs money</a>, they are some of the best paying. (Even <em>The Verge </em>is not immune with Vox Media displaying ads for gambling companies on its sites and podcasts.) Stake is an infamously known quantity in the video game streaming ecosystem, throwing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764530/twitch-star-felix-xqc-lengyel-has-signed-a-100-million-deal-with-rival-platform-kick">eye-watering sums of cash at the most popular streamers</a> to either make content on their own platform (Stake owns livestreaming site and Twitch competitor Kick) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938853/kick-nickmercs-gambling-contract-stake">or to gamble on stream to their millions of viewers</a>. </p></div><p>Until now, Riot has prohibited its esports partner organizations from taking sponsorships from gambling companies. But the publisher says its guidelines can help implement the new type of sponsorship in a “responsible” way with guidelines for teams and Riot to follow. These guidelines include Riot vetting all potential betting sponsors, teams adhering to an integrity program, and the prohibition of gambling ads on team jerseys or official Riot broadcasts.</p><p>The formal inclusion of sports betting comes with significant risk to both competitive and moral integrity. Kids and young adults watch these streams, as well as the media around them. While Riot is not letting gambling companies put their logos on jerseys or the official broadcasts, the media around its esport is likely to become even more inundated with offers for gambling. This is what we’ve already seen with programming and podcasts focused on traditional sports like the NBA and NFL in the years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24312149/sports-gymnastics-tennis-surveillance-ai#:~:text=But%20in%202018%2C%20the%20law%20was%20overturned%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20ruling%20that%20it%20was%20a%20violation%20of%20the%2010th%20Amendment">since the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was overturned in 2018</a>. </p><div><p>There have also already been allegations of and investigations into match fixing in both <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/underdog-league-of-legends-esports-scene-rocked-by-massive-match-fixing-allegations-impacting-two-thirds-of-players-the-stench-of-this-will-never-leave/"><em>League of Legends</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/article/1926386268209873010"><em>Valorant</em></a> esports, with Riot recently <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/news/esports/competitive-ruling-lco/">banning two players from Riot competitions for three years</a>. The addition of sports betting sponsorship – which could become a significant if not main source of revenue for many teams – has the potential to exacerbate existing competitive integrity issues as well as <a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1852450790146773489">open up a potential avenue of harassment for players</a>.</p></div><p>With esports revenues still comparatively low, the industry has been getting increasingly desperate for any new sources of funding. Riot <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/league-of-legends-valorant-esports-world-cup">has already faced criticism</a> for participating in events funded by Saudi Arabia as a part of the country’s longstanding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">sportswashing strategy</a>. Riot’s inclusion of sports betting for <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> will likely be no less controversial.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694360/league-of-legends-valorant-sports-betting-sponsorships]]></content:encoded>
