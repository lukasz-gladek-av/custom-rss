In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fblog%2Fgog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you%2F" rel="sponsored">an update on Monday</a>, GOG announced that its co-founder, Michał Kiciński, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">has acquired</a> the digital storefront and its online gaming platform <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/6/5785858/gog-galaxy-takes-on-steam-with-drm-free-games-and-optional-community">GOG Galaxy</a> from CD Projekt — which he also co-founded — for $25.2 million.</p><p>The acquisition isn’t changing anything about GOG’s mission to keep games DRM-free, according to the announcement that says it’s “more central to GOG than ever:”</p><div><blockquote><p>GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.</p><p>This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.</p></blockquote></div><p>It also won’t change GOG’s relationship with its former parent company, CD Projekt, which will keep selling existing games, like <em>The Witcher</em> series and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, along with upcoming titles, on the marketplace:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850832/gog-cd-projekt-acquisition-steam]]></content:encoded>
