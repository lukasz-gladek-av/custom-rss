The ultra-lightweight wired mouse weighs just 68 grams and features an ergonomic build with a right-slanted design for enhanced comfort.

The latest installment is a fantastic addition to Capcom’s long-running fighting series, with smooth gameplay, great visuals, and a new single-player mode that lets you explore the world with your own fighter. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23741204/street-fighter-6-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>You can grab a physical copy of <strong><em>Visions of Mana</em> </strong>for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visions-Mana-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CQ73WDH8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visions-Mana-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CQ716Z1F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Xbox Series X</a> at Amazon for $34.99 ($25 off), an all-time low. Square Enix’s long-awaited action RPG marks the first main entry in the <em>Mana</em> series in almost 20 years, and though it suffers from a few flaws, it features a rewarding class system, lush environments, and a memorable cast of characters. The Amazon edition also includes a sticker set, but is otherwise identical to the standard edition.</span></li><li><span><strong>Samsung’s beefy 49-inch Odyssey G9 gaming monitor</strong> is on sale for $949.99 ($650 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0CDQMQQS2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, marking one of its better prices to date. The curved ultrawide is loaded with features, including an OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate, great gaming performance, and a speedy 0.03ms response time. It’s also wonderful to look at, unsurprisingly, thanks to its deep contrast levels and support for HDR10 and HDR10 Plus.</span></li></ul></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->110</span></p><div><p>The Atari 2600 Plus is a smaller version of the Atari 2600, featuring HDMI and USB-C ports.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/659074/nintendo-switch-online-game-sharing-loophole<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch just got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2">new update</a> that adds Virtual Game Cards as a way to share digital games with other people. But the update also closes a loophole that would let you play shared games online at the same time as somebody you were sharing the game with, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">reported by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>Before the introduction of Virtual Game Cards, the only way Nintendo allowed you to share digital Switch games was by logging into your Nintendo Account on a second Switch and downloading the game to that console. Using that system, which is now available under “Online License Settings,” it was possible for you and a friend to play that game that you owned online simultaneously. </p><p>Following the new Switch update, that digital sharing system is still an option – you don’t have to use Virtual Game Cards. However, with the old system, two people can’t play a shared game online at the same time anymore, which could be a disappointment if you relied on it ahead of this update.</p><p>If you do opt to use Virtual Game Cards, Nintendo won’t just force you to manage those on a Switch or Switch 2; the company will also let you manage them from <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/portal/vgcs">a website</a>, which could be handy if you don’t have your Switch nearby but want to share a game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
