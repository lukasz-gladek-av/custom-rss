            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is releasing a new GPU driver today that includes a massive amount of fixes for bugs and crashes that have plagued its Game Ready drivers recently. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">widespread reports</a> of black screens, game crashes, and general stability issues, today’s 576.02 driver release (<a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-desktop-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql.exe">.exe download</a>) not only bumps the version number significantly from last month’s 572.83, it also includes a number of significant fixes.</p><p>The <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf">release notes</a> for Nvidia’s 576.02 driver mention that it fixes stability issues with Windows 11 version 24H2, a BSOD when playing DLSS 4 games with Multi Frame Generation, random black screen issues with the RTX 50-series GPUs, and general system stability issues. Nvidia has also addressed “game stability issues when playing games with DLSS Frame Generation + GSYNC.”</p><p>This driver release also fixes random crashes in <em>Fortnite</em>, a <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> hang after the game is idle, a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> crash, and stutter when using VSYNC in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. There are also a variety of fixes for <em>Hellblade 2</em>, <em>Control</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em>, and <em>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</em>.</p><p>It’s an unusual amount of bug fixes for Nvidia’s usual driver updates, which regularly contain only a handful of fixed gaming or general bugs that fill half a page of Nvidia’s release notes. These latest bug fixes take up almost two pages this time around.</p><p>Hopefully this large list addresses most of the complaints we’ve seen ever since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 release in January</a>. While Nvidia has struggled with RTX 50-series driver stability, the issues have also been impacting existing GPUs after the introduction of DLSS 4.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s 576.02 driver also supports the GeForce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti GPU that’s launching today</a>, starting at $379.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
