            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After recently admitting that it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to Joy-Con grip detachment complaints with its Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case, Dbrand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lwrl9q/joycon_detachment_update_part_3_we_fixed_it/">has some good news</a>: it says its redesigned Joy-Con grips fix the issue <em>and</em> the company will be able to mass produce them.</p><p>Dbrand had already promised it would be replacing the grips for everyone, and now we know that the replacement will be the redesign instead of a refined version of what’s already available. Here’s a video from Dbrand showing the Joy-Con not detaching while being held from the Joy-Con with the updated grips.</p><p>In addition to the modification to the Joy-Con grips — which Dbrand is calling Joy-Lock — the company says it will be sending out silicone friction pads to place on the Killswitch adapter for Nintendo’s dock to address “the issue of one-handed undocking on our Dock Adapter” and keep the adapter “snugly seated” on the dock.</p><p>By “early next week,” Dbrand says it will “share a production schedule that outlines when you’ll be able to claim your free Joy-Lock replacements, and when you can expect them to ship.” New production and any unshipped orders will include the Joy-Lock Grips and have the silicone friction pads preinstalled on the Dock Adapter.</p><p>In June, some users of the original Killswitch Switch 2 case found that if they held the console primarily by a Joy-Con while the case and grips were on, the controller <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">would pop off</a> and the console would drop down. Probably not what you want to have happen to your brand-new Nintendo console.</p><p>Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy post</a> about the issue where it argued that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this” and that Joy-Con detachment only happens if you hold the console in a very specific way. But many users compared that response to when Steve Jobs told people running into iPhone 4 reception issues to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">“just avoid holding it that way.”</a></p><p>The company soon after published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">a mea culpa post</a> where it said that “you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring” and outlined how it was working on two potential fixes: a slightly tweaked version of the original grip and the one with a bigger redesign.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704767/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-lock-grip-detachment-fixed]]></content:encoded>
