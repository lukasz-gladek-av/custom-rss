            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia is announcing some big changes to its GeForce Now cloud streaming service today. The existing Priority membership is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-performance-membership">being renamed to Performance</a>, with 1440p streaming, ultrawide resolution support, and the ability to save graphics settings across streaming sessions. Nvidia is also introducing a 100-hour monthly playtime cap for new Performance or Ultimate GeForce Now members starting on January 1st, 2025.</p><p>New GeForce Now members that sign up for the service from 2025 onward will have a cap on monthly playtime set at 100 hours. That works out to around three hours of usage every day of the month, and Nvidia says it’s putting the cap in place to avoid increasing membership prices “in the foreseeable future.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The GeForce Now membership options.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“This allows GeForce Now to continue to provide unparalleled quality and speed — as well as short to no queue times&nbsp;— for all paid members, without increasing membership fees,” says Nvidia in a blog post. “This change will affect less than 6 percent of members.”</p><p>While this cap will only initially impact new GeForce Now members, all active paid subscribers as of the end of this year will still lose their unlimited playtime on January 1st, 2026. After that date, all GeForce Now subscribers will be subjected to the 100-hour playtime cap.</p><div><figcaption><em>You’ll be able to track your playtime in Nvidia’s dashboard.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>GeForce Now subscribers will be able to carry over 15 hours of unused time automatically to the next month, but if you hit the 100-hour cap, then you’ll need to purchase additional playtime or play using the Basic rigs for the remainder of the month. GeForce Now subscribers will be able to purchase 15 hours of extra playtime, with the Performance 15-hour blocks priced at $2.99 and the Ultimate 15-hour playtime priced at $5.99.</p><p>Nvidia is also offering a 25 percent discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes until November 22nd, which you can then upgrade to a monthly or six-month recurring membership to lock in a full year of unlimited playtime ahead of the 100-hour playtime caps for existing members in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
