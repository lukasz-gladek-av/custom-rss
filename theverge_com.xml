Sony’s latest State of Play — a showcase event for upcoming PS5 games — kicks off on February 12th at 5PM ET and it’ll last more than an hour.</p><p>We don’t know what exactly will be shown. Sony says that the event will include “news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe.” However, it sounds like one of the biggest upcoming PS5 games, Insomniac’s bloody take on <em>Wolverine</em>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-developer-suggests-wolverine-will-skip-tomorrows-big-state-of-play">might not make an appearance</a>. Most likely the event will feature a mixture of some of Sony’s tentpole single-player experiences from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024">studios like Naughty Dog</a>, along with its continued (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">albeit scaled back</a>) push into live-service games through upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874434/playstation-sony-horizon-hunters-gathering-live-service-ps5-pc">titles like <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">Bungie’s return to <em>Marathon</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>You can watch the event live on both <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGdFBim7nYY">YouTube</a>, and stay tuned here for all of the most important and interesting reveals and announcements.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Tons of details about Saros.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcLGdMG0L8Q">a new trailer</a>, Housemarque showed off things like the game’s main hub, the skill tree, a way to fast-travel to different locations, and how eclipses will change the game’s world. <em>Saros</em> launches on April 30th.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s not a sprint.</p><p>Bungie’s return to the <em>Marathon</em> universe launches very soon — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">March 5th!</a> — so here’s a new trailer that sort of gets across what the extraction shooter will be like.

There aren’t many details on what to expect, but Sony says that the event will be more than an hour long and include “eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”</p><p>That said, we can make some guesses for games that are likely to appear. <em>Saros</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785146/sony-playstation-saros-ps5-release-date-trailer-returnal-housemarque">the sci-fi shooter from <em>Returnal</em> developer Housemarque</a>, is out in April, while Marvel games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer"><em>Wolverine </em>from Insomniac</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/711496/whens-marvel-pretty-soon"><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> from Arc System Works</a> are both expected in 2026. Sony also just revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874434/playstation-sony-horizon-hunters-gathering-live-service-ps5-pc">a multiplayer <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> spinoff last week</a>, which seems like a good candidate to be featured, as does Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">which is out in just over a month</a>.
