            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655709/hori-usb-nintendo-switch-2-camera-gamechat-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After debuting a fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Piranha Plant-inspired alternative</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Nintendo’s own $50 Switch 2 camera</a>, Hori is back with another camera accessory for the console that’s less fun but more functional. Standing just shy of two inches tall and weighing 30 grams, the camera is small and light enough to be connected to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port without making the console feel top-heavy while playing in handheld mode.</p><p>Hori’s USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/NSX-023/dp/B0F5WTSW21">Amazon Japan website</a> for 3,981 yen, or around $28, making it much cheaper than the company’s $60 Piranha Plant cam. It’s not known if the tiny camera will be exclusive to Japan, but since the Piranha Plant is already listed on <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/nsx-001u/">Hori’s US website</a>, there’s a good chance this one will also see wider availability. For now, only Amazon Japan has the new camera listed with a June 5th, 2025 release date.</p><p>In addition to being small enough to perch atop the Switch 2, the GameChat-compatible camera can also be attached to an included weighted base allowing it to stand alone on an entertainment center like Nintendo’s own camera is designed to. The base also has a fold-down support on the underside so you can sit the camera on the top edge of a TV, assuming that edge is thin enough.</p><p>Hori’s latest camera seems like a better alternative to Nintendo’s in terms of portability, but like the Piranha Plant it’s limited to a resolution of only 640x480 – a significant step down from the 1080p capabilities of Nintendo’s. That’s potentially enough resolution to match the quality of Nintendo’s camera when Hori’s is perched atop the Switch 2 and right in front of your face. But when it’s zooming in on you from across the room while the camera is sitting next to your TV dock, there will likely be a significant reduction in video quality while using GameChat.</p><p>Nintendo says “any compatible USB-C camera you’d like” will work with the Switch 2 so you can probably use the external webcam you bought for work. But the company also warns that “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2Fcamera%2F" rel="sponsored">not all cameras may work as intended</a>” and it has included a testing tool in the Switch 2’s settings to make sure. If you’d rather play it safe and know ahead of time, both of Hori’s cameras are officially licensed Nintendo accessories.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
