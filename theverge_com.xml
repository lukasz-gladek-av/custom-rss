The Firework Season starts January 23rd. The update will be themed around Lunar New Year celebrations, starting a new Mira Journey battle pass while offering limited-time quests and a new area to explore.</p><p><a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news"><em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s official website</a> has previews of what outfits will be available as well as a full breakdown of all the new content. Since <em>Nikki </em>is a gacha game, there are a number of premium outfits to try and earn. But developer Infold is also offering three outfits in three colors for a total of nine different outfits all for free. I’m particularly intrigued by the Radiant Night outfit as it looks like as a high-fashion version of <em>Resident Evil VII</em>’s Lady Dimitrescu.</p><p>Check it out as the website also has codes players can use to redeem helpful in-game items.<em> Infinity Nikki</em> has also released a trailer for the update showing off the Firework Isles, the new location that will be available during the season. Expect the the area to be chock full of scenic vistas for stylists to take their best pictures including a magical horse-drawn carriage that zooms through the sky.</p><p>The game’s also adding a new boss encounter, The Dark Bouquet, which will probably be added to the Realm of the Dark boss list for players to challenge weekly. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> soundtrack is also launching on select music platforms which is a welcome development considering some of those tracks — especially the one for the Ghost Train dungeon — are incredibly funky for a generally lighthearted dress-up game. Fireworks Season starts January 23rd and lasts until February 25th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
