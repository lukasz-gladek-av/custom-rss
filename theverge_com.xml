            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Silksong</em> resembles the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> in many ways, though right from the start, you can hear one key difference: Hornet. <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s protagonist was silent, but just as Hornet was voiced in that game, as the protagonist of <em>Silksong</em>, she has a voice, too, and actor Makoto Koji brings a lot of personality to the role.</p><p>“She’s confident, she’s sure of herself, she’s very stoic,” Koji says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. But Hornet has a goofiness as well, according to Koji, and she thinks Team Cherry did a good job showing how multifaceted Hornet is. This is particularly impressive because Hornet, and all of the characters in <em>Silksong</em>, talk in brief statements of gibberish. Even if you’re reading a long text passage, characters don’t speak those full sentences, instead saying a word or short phrase in a pretend language.</p><p>“I did a lot of making up my own gibberish,” Koji says. That meant she could only use one or two words to express something that’s happening in the narrative. Koji chose to make words that felt natural to her and that were “instinctual,” but she’s been surprised with how the <em>Hollow Knight</em> community has taken to some of the gibberish she made up.</p><p>Koji walked me through an example from the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> where (spoiler warning!) she created words for Hornet’s optional, heroic appearance during the final boss fight. “It’s a moment where Hornet is telling the character, ‘Now is the moment. Do it now.’ That was the only direction I got,” Koji says. So she scribbled down the words “gek tuu” — which the players have jokingly interpreted as Hornet telling the player to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEI4-c9x1C4">“git gud.”</a></p><p>Koji is <a href="https://www.paperrabbits.com/">an animator</a>, not a trained voice actor, but she got the role of Hornet in part because she shared an office with <em>Silksong</em> developer Team Cherry, a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/about">very small team in Adelaide, Australia</a>, while it was working on the first <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Originally, the role was supposed to go to a friend of hers, but after learning that that friend was going to move overseas, Koji offered to give it a go. “And I guess the rest is <em>Hollow Knight</em> history,” she says.</p><p>With <em>Silksong</em>, “I went in wanting to do the best for the character,” Koji says. Team Cherry — “the boys,” as she frequently called them during our interview — allowed her to express emotions that she doesn’t usually tap into in everyday life. “I had a lot of fun with it.”</p><p>Ultimately, she feels she’s just one part of all of the work that goes into creating Hornet who she is. “There is so much work involved to bring a character to life, from an initial sketch, to drawing each frame, to implementing the behaviours and weaving all the narrative strands,” she says. “The voice / sounds of the character, or lack of, is only the final icing on the cake.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/785915/hollow-knight-silksong-hornet-voice-actor-makoto-koji-gibberish]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s first-party <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The <strong>EasySMX S10</strong>, as it’s called, is available for $50.39 from <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control">EasySMX</a> with code <strong>GETS10</strong>.</p><p>The S10 is comfortable to use for long gaming sessions, and it has features that aren’t commonly built into third-party gamepads, including amiibo support and rumble that feels like it’s in the same ballpark as Nintendo’s HD rumble. It can also remotely wake the Nintendo Switch 2, not just the original Switch, from standby.</p><p>The S10 would be easier to recommend than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller even if they were the same price, since EasySMX’s model features accurate, power-efficient TMR joysticks, plus some satisfyingly clicky buttons and triggers (note: these are divisive, you might not like them as much as I do). But at $40 less, you don’t need to feel bad about getting this instead of Nintendo’s official gamepad. Take that leftover money and treat yourself to something nice instead.</p><p>If you’re an Android user looking for an unobtrusive Bluetooth tracker for your wallet, Ugreen just launched the <strong>FineTrack Slim Smart G</strong>. It’s just 1.7mm thick (approximately the thickness of two credit cards), letting it to sit next to your other cards without sticking out, and its built-in battery can last for up to five years. For its launch, Ugreen has knocked $2 off the $25.99 tracker, dropping it to $23.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-FineTrack-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0FBWBDB1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The downside is that it can’t be charged, so you’ll need to dispose of it and buy a new tracker once those five years are up. That stinks, but its specs mean it should provide a pretty good five years of service. It features a built-in 80db alarm to help you find it via Google’s Find Hub network, after all, along with IP68 protection against dust and water. Just keep in mind that, if it’s submerged, you won’t be able to track it.</p><p>Now through October 5th, OnePlus has a few back-to-college deals up its sleeve that everyone can enjoy, whether you’re a student or not. The one that caught my eye is the 43mm <strong>OnePlus Watch 3</strong>, which is available for $269.99 ($30 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDK2QHGH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-watch-3-43mm" rel="sponsored">OnePlus</a> (with coupon code <strong>HARVEST</strong>). The Wear OS 5-equipped smartwatch has gone on sale before, but after a nearly month-long period when it wasn’t discounted, it’s returned to its second-best price to date.</p><p>If you’re shopping for an Android watch, we recommend including OnePlus’ latest wearable on your shortlist. Outside of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715171/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review-smartwatch-wearos-antioxidant-gemini">recent Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the newest models available. It offers a better value than its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, with updated software, a rotating crown, an enhanced GPS antenna, and a suite of new health features.</p><div><p id="other-deals-we-loved-from-this-week"><h2>Other deals we loved from this week</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s tappable <strong>amiibos</strong> are an expensive hobby, as most figures for the Switch and Switch 2 usually cost between $15 and $40 each. However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30583%26ranSiteID%3Dy9ozrjBcgg8-njoLbLY2R42D6nlyOmcg0Q" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> recently did collectors and trinket enjoyers a favor by slashing prices on a handful of models, which start at just $5.99 a pop. Not just that, some of the newer ones that debuted alongside the Switch 2 (including ones from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>) are down to $15.99 at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30584" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amiibo&amp;rh=p_n_deal_type%3A23566065011&amp;dc&amp;crid=220URFJ8W3DBG&amp;qid=1758548483&amp;rnid=23566063011&amp;sprefix=amiibo%2Caps%2C124&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_n_deal_type_1&amp;ds=v1%3A%2Bg%2BMR7wxIGaD3Vs3%2FhljWFmfTc%2BhMQqdAdiXGyIg5Mc&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — over half off their original price.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>We highlighted the Prime-exclusive deal on <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong> last weekend, but it’s worth sharing again in case you missed it. If you sign into your Prime account ahead of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/783008/amazon-october-prime-day-sale-best-early-deals-2025">October Prime Day event</a>, which starts on October 7th, you’ll be able to sign up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku/ref=2025?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a free three-month trial</a> of Kindle Unlimited. After your free trial period ends, you’ll be charged $11.99 a month unless you cancel the service. Kindle Unlimited is filled with many, many titles you can read for no extra charge, so if you’re a voracious reader, this is a fabulous deal that costs nothing to redeem.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>If you’re a PC gamer with a taste for spooky games, you might have already dipped into several titles from Remedy Entertainment’s catalog, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake 2</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, and others.
