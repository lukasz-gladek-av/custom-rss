            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/logitech/652423/logitech-price-increases-mouse-keyboard-accessories<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Many of Logitech’s products are pricier now than they were in the recent past. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4d__01u2mc">video published this week</a>, YouTuber Cameron Dougherty detailed increases as high as 25 percent on the company’s PC and gaming accessories, including well-known Logitech gear like the MX Master 3S mouse.</p><p>I took a peek at a few Internet Archive captures of Logitech’s current offerings to confirm the YouTuber’s findings, and sure enough, prices are going up. The MX Master 3S, my favorite mouse and the one I’m using at this very moment, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fmx-master-3s.910-006556" rel="sponsored">now costs $119.99</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250219183053/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s.910-006556">$20 increase from before</a>. And on the keyboards side, for instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23858523/logitech-pro-x-tkl-lightspeed-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features">Pro X TKL</a> has <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fpro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html" rel="sponsored">gone up to $219.99</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303235239/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.920-012154">$199.99 before</a>. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250321205050/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119">previously $27.99</a> K400 Plus Wireless Touch, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fk400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119" rel="sponsored">went up by $7 to $34.99</a> — a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made.</p><p>Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207231555/https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html">was $159.99</a>, but is <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html" rel="sponsored">now $149.99</a>.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Donald Trump’s global tariffs</a>, which the company cited earlier this month as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647130/logitech-has-withdrawn-its-fiscal-year-2026-outlook-because-of-tariffs">withdrew its financial outlook</a> for fiscal year 2026. Logitech didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths. There have been <em>Star Wars</em> skins in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers">game dating back to 2019</a>, and last year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148086/may-the-fortnite-be-with-you"><em>Star Wars</em> elements spread throughout the entire <em>Fortnite </em>ecosystem</a>, including its Lego and rhythm game spinoffs.</p></div><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616926/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-lawless-trailer-battle-pass">has a heist theme</a>, and has featured celebrity cameos from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/627340/auto-draft">Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644491/switch-it-up-like-nintendo-xbox-playstation-pc-and-mobile">Sabrina Carpenter</a>.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
