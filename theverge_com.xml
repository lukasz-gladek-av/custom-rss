At the Game Awards, Gearbox Software revealed the first proper trailer for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, which is due out in 2025. The trailer starts with a cinematic depicting a large-scale conflict of some sort, before getting into the actual gameplay — which is as colorful and violent as you’d expect from the franchise. The game is playable solo or co-op with up to three other players, and Gearbox says that there are “billions” of weapons to use.</p><p>Here’s the basic set-up:</p><div><blockquote><p>Break free from the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. Now a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across the planet. Ignite a resistance and blast your way through mechanical monstrosities, bloodthirsty bandits, and vicious beasts. Amass an arsenal of death-dealing firepower to wreak havoc as you tear your way across Kairos. </p></blockquote></div><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em> was first announced this summer, and will be the first new entry in the looter shooter series since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20803683/borderlands-3-preview-gearbox-interview-social-media-streamers-vlogging"><em>Borderlands 3</em> in 2019</a>. It also follows the franchise’s debut on the big screen, as the <em>Borderlands</em> movie hit theaters in August to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand">less than critical acclaim</a>.

The trailer, debuting during this year’s The Game Awards, didn’t share much narrative details meaning that director Hidetaka Miyazaki might not have told a fib. <em>Nightreign</em> could very well be a prequel, chronicling the events that lead up to all the shenanigans in the base game and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em></a> DLC.</p><p>While we don’t yet know where this takes place in Lands Between chronology, the trailer did show off a ton of gameplay which appears to be the same as <em>Elden Ring</em> but with a greater emphasis on co-op. Several moments in the trailer featured combat with more than one Tarnished working together and doing never-before-seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079145/while-you-were-studying-the-erdtree-i-studied-the-blade">flippy-dippy martial arts moves.</a> But as the trailer played, there was the theory that this would be some kind of mobile version of <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>FromSoftware has, so far, only confirmed Xbox, PlayStation, and PC platforms and, surprisingly, a release date. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> will launch sometime next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
