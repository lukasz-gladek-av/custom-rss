            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674953/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I usually struggle with strategy games. They’re typically too hard for me, and I often get overwhelmed at managing multiple characters or squads. But I couldn’t put down <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, which blends ideas from strategy games <em>and</em> classic <em>TMNT</em> arcade games to keep things snappy, easy to play, and full of action.</p><p>One way <em>Tactical Takedown </em>— developed by <em>I Am Your Beast</em> maker Strange Scaffold — keeps things simple is by having you play as just one character in each of the game’s 20 levels. The four turtles have different movesets; Leonardo, for example, uses his swords to aggressively attack enemies, while Michelangelo can zip around the playing field on his skateboard. You’re able to customize each turtle’s arsenal by buying new moves, but I didn’t change the movesets at all and got through the game just fine.</p><p>Battles take place in a grid overlaid on small chunks of very <em>TMNT</em> locations, like a street, sewer, or subway system. Every turn, you have six “action points” to spend as you please, whether that’s moving around the level or attacking bad guys. You just press a button to use one of your moves, no menu required, which speeds things up considerably. You have six hearts and three “lives” — lose a life and the game will quickly flash a “Continue” sign before letting you choose where you’d like to drop in the level to keep the fight going. (You also lose a score multiplier.)</p><p>The levels feel like tiny dioramas, and while characters will move into a kick or a punch when attacking or a fall when taking damage, they aren’t actively animated moment to moment. It all creates the sense that you’re playing with action figures.</p><p>Perhaps <em>Tactical Takedown</em>’s best trick is that the levels are constantly shifting around you. Every once in a while, the game will show you that a new piece of land is going to drop in on the next turn, and after that spot is in place, you’ll get a warning that another part of the level is going to fall away. It means that you’re constantly dealing with new terrain, layouts, and hazards like poisonous sewage or cars driving by while also strategizing on how to fight bad guys. Sometimes, after adding a new chunk of a level, the game even flashes the word “Go,” encouraging you to move forward like you would in an arcade game.</p><p>Even better, if there isn’t a wall, you can send enemies flying off the edge of a level into the void, defeating them instantly. It took me a bit to understand that the game <em>wants</em> you to do that as much as possible; occasionally, there will be a lot of bad guys in a level, and the only way to efficiently take them out is by sending them to their doom.</p><p>For me, it all came together in a level where you play as Leonardo in a subway tunnel. The level started on a subway platform, and then the game signaled that a subway car would appear. I navigated my way onto the subway car, and the platform fell away. After a few turns on the subway car, it “arrived” at the next subway stop, and I had to hop off. It really felt like I was “advancing” through a level in a faster-paced game, and all while managing a legion of enemies with Leonardo’s swords. </p><p>The genre is usually slow, but when you get in a good rhythm, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> almost feels as crisp as the <em>TMNT</em> arcade games — despite being a turn-based strategy game.</p><p><sub>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown<em> is now available on PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is more expensive in practically every way: pricier console, pricier games, an entire Chat button <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/645351/auto-draft">you’ll eventually have to pay to use</a>. So it was nice when Nintendo revealed you <em>won’t</em> need its <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-camera%2F6625885.p%3F" rel="sponsored">own $55 camera</a> to video chat with pals.</p><p>“You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C® camera you’d like,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-Switch-2%2FNintendo-Switch-2-USB-Cameras-2785632.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOortQZR2fdDM2tuV7SE0_7UpHFzdp3O6oO9-xW_WUkZeyn7RGG6a%23%3A~%3Atext%3DYou%2520can%2520use%2520the%2520Nintendo%2520Switch%25202%2520camera%2520accessory%2520(sold%2520separately)%2520or%2520any%2520compatible%2520USB%252DC%2520camera%2520you%2527d%2520like." rel="sponsored">the company wrote</a>. But you might be mighty disappointed if you simply buy a PC webcam off the shelf.</p><p>Many USB-C webcams we’ve tried don’t work at all, including the ones you’ll typically find on “best webcam” lists around the internet, like the Logitech Brio 4K, the Insta360 Link, and the Elgato Facecam MK.2. Meanwhile, ancient USB-A cameras like my Logitech C920 fire up instantly with no trouble at all.</p><p>And in our testing, it doesn’t seem to matter if you use the Switch USB-C ports or the USB-A ports on the dock, whether you’re going through a C-to-A adapter, or whether you daisy-chain with a USB hub: the webcams that work, work, and the ones that don’t, don’t.</p><p>Overall, it’s starting to look like Nintendo didn’t mean “compatible with USB-C,” but rather “compatible with Switch 2.” So why did it suggest you can use any camera you’d like? We’ve asked Nintendo. (It didn’t have an answer for us just yet.)</p><p>As of launch, neither Nintendo nor any major webcam manufacturer had even a partial list for us of compatible webcams. We asked Logitech, Razer, Microsoft, Anker, Elgato, Dell, Insta360, Obsbot, and Opal, but they didn’t have anything yet. (We’ll publish an update and/or a new story next week if they do.)</p><p>In the meanwhile, it may be up to gamers and the media to create a list themselves. So here’s a first stab at that!</p><div><p id="we-confirmed-it-works-with-switch-2"><h2>We confirmed it works with Switch 2</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</span></li><li><span>Logitech C920</span></li><li><span>Logitech C922</span></li><li><span>Logitech C270</span></li><li><span>Logitech Brio 300</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNZ4T4SR??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">A $10 USB endoscope</a>, amusingly</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="we-confirmed-it-doesnt-work"><h2>We confirmed it doesn’t work</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Logitech Brio 4K</span></li><li><span>Elgato Facecam MK.2</span></li><li><span>Insta360 Link</span></li><li><span>Opal Tadpole</span></li><li><span>Anker PowerConf C200</span></li><li><span>Obsbot Meet SE</span></li><li><span>DJI Osmo Pocket 3</span></li><li><span>Android phone in webcam mode</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="reportedly-works-with-switch-2"><h2>Reportedly works with Switch 2</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681095/switch-up-your-webcam">iPhone with USB-C to HDMI cable and HDMI to USB-C capture cable</a></span></li><li><span>Razer Kiyo Pro</span></li><li><span>Razer Kiyo</span></li><li><span>Logitech StreamCam</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI0-srq7UZc">Logitech MX Brio</a></span></li><li><span>Logitech C930e</span></li><li><span>Logitech C910</span></li><li><span>Logitech C615</span></li><li><span>Logitech C310</span></li><li><span>Logitech C250</span></li><li><span>Microsoft LifeCam 3000</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6tOfd-oZI">Microsoft LifeCam Studio</a></span></li><li><span>HP 4310</span></li><li><span>Lenovo WHWC500</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="reportedly-doesnt-work"><h2>Reportedly doesn’t work</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Opal C1</span></li><li><span>Elgato Facecam Pro</span></li><li><span>Elgato Facecam Neo</span></li><li><span>Elgato Facecam MK.1</span></li><li><span>Nexigo N60</span></li><li><span>Sony ZV-E10</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHpPoIfaQBM">Sony EyeToy</a></span></li><li><span>PS5 HD Camera</span></li><li><span>PS4 Camera</span></li><li><span>Insta360 X3</span></li><li><span>Microsoft Xbox One Kinect</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xXMy_cn6hzA">Xbox Live Vision</a></span></li></ul></div><p>To Nintendo’s credit, it is incredibly easy to test which cameras <em>do</em> work with the console.
