He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Amazon finally has listings for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the US – though right now, you can only register your interest for an <em>invitation</em> to purchase a console. If you’re interested, here are links to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">console and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3GWXLTS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">the console on its own</a>.</p><p>It’s a big change following Nintendo removing listings for its products from Amazon starting last year. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?embedded-checkout=true">in June</a> that Nintendo pulled the listings because third-party sellers sold games at prices “that undercut Nintendo’s advertised rates.” Nintendo and Amazon pushed back on <em>Bloomberg’s</em> report in statements to the publication but didn’t go into specifics.</p><p>However, there have been signs that something had changed between Nintendo and Amazon, with Switch 2 games like <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lrk3nx4nfy2z?ref_src=embed">all recently getting official Amazon product pages</a>.</p><p>If you request an Amazon invite, the product page will show a message saying that “if invited to purchase, you’ll get an email with a link that’s valid for 22 hours. We won’t be able to grant all requests.” I got an email notifying me about my request, too.</p><p>The Switch 2 has been a huge hit for Nintendo, becoming the fastest-selling game console of all time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">since its June 5th launch</a>. If you are still looking for a console and Amazon doesn’t come through, retailers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/685578/nintendo-switch-2-restock-walmart-availability">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/695273/nintendo-switch-2-in-store-restock-best-buy">Best Buy</a> have occasional restocks.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/701385/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-listings]]></content:encoded>
