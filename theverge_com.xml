            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago, the last time Framework had an event in San Francisco, California, the highlight was the Framework Laptop 16 — a laptop promising the “holy grail” of upgradable graphics cards, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">easily one of the most ambitious laptops ever made</a>.</p><p>But today, the Framework Laptop 16 got little mention at its new event, which focused on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">new, similarly gamer-oriented Framework Desktop</a> instead. While the Desktop and Framework’s original 13-inch laptop both got the latest AMD processors today, we don’t yet know if or when the Framework Laptop 16 might leap forward too.</p><p>The only mention of Framework’s flagship laptop was a new “One Key Module” that will experimentally be available for the Framework community to build their own electromechanical keyboards, should they choose to, that would be thin enough to fit in the Laptop 16’s extremely thin Input Module bay. (You can see how the Input Modules work <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7269794917466115374">in my video here</a>.)</p><div><p>While Framework did finally<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322955/framework-16-expansion-bay-dual-m2-adapter"> ship its promised M.2 adapter bay in December</a>, which will let you stick extra SSDs or other peripherals into a Framework Laptop 16 instead of a discrete graphics card, my big question is: is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">promising but somewhat problematic laptop</a> a dead end, or will it get new mainboards and new chips in the future?</p></div><p>I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel at the event today, and he wouldn’t say much, but he was clear on one thing: “We’re nowhere near done with Framework Laptop 16.”</p><p>I pushed my luck, asking: Is today the day he can assure us that the Laptop 16 will eventually see at least one GPU upgrade or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23612467/framework-laptop-16-battery-parts-games">snap-on secondary battery</a>?</p><p>“Today is not that day,” he told me.</p><p>I want to see Framework succeed, and perhaps it’s too early to begin to wonder otherwise — it was still shipping preordered batches of the Laptop 16 to buyers through the middle of last year.</p><div><p>But we’ve pushed the company pretty hard on the GPU in the past specifically because it’s a thing rivals have tried and failed at before — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement">Dell/Alienware even got sued over the failed promise of the Alienware Area-51m</a>, which never bothered to ship a second generation of its supposedly upgradable GPUs.</p></div><p>Framework has resisted our pushes so far, stopping short of confirming it in our 2023 story: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=upgradability%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Patel.%20%E2%80%9C-,We%20are%20committed,-to%20making%20sure">here’s his exact language at the time</a>. It’d be nice if Framework could assure buyers that the upgrades are absolutely coming. But personally, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">more than a few things</a> about that laptop I’d like to change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Framework was doing a bit of a rethink even if it does deliver.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like its smaller (but far from <em>small</em>) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Blade 16</a> cousin, the new Razer Blade 18 will come with Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs and Intel Arrow Lake CPUs. But one major way it differs is its large 18-inch display, which has dual modes allowing it to run at either 3840 x 2400 at 240Hz or 1920 x 1200 at 440Hz.</p><p>The Blade 18 will start at $3,199.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti and climb to $4,499.99 with an RTX 5090. But if either the Blade 18 or the already announced $2,799.99 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Blade 16</a> are the right pricey option for you, you’ll have to wait until late-April for them to actually ship.</p><p>Razer isn’t the only PC manufacturer offering new gaming laptops for preorder today. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610255/nvidia-rtx-50-series-gaming-laptop-preorders-begin-february-25th">Nvidia already teased</a>, a variety of new notebooks sporting RTX 50-series GPUs now have finalized pricing, and there are fresh offerings from the likes of <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/content/2025-rog-gaming-laptops/">Asus ROG</a>, <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/rtx50-gaming-laptops">MSI</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/gaming-pc/laptops.html" rel="sponsored">HP</a>. Back when many of these laptops were first announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340121/ces-2025-laptops-best-lenovo-asus-msi-razer-alienware">CES</a> in January, they mostly had estimated prices or no pricing at all.</p><p>Asus’s flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">ROG Strix Scar 16</a>, with its new wraparound RGB lighting, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-strix/rog-strix-scar-16-2025">starts at $3,299.99</a> with an RTX 5080 GPU and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog%2F90nr0l81-m005p0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">$4,299.99</a> with a top-of-the-line RTX 5090. The sleeker Zephyrus G14, which is a <em>Verge </em>favorite for balancing gaming performance with everyday usability, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/wtb/">starts at $2,499.99</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti. And the larger Zephyrus G16 starts with the same GPU at <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2025-gu605/wtb/">$2,699.99</a>. The G14 can go up to the RTX 5080, but the G16 will go all the way to an RTX 5090 once those higher-end configurations come a little later.</p><p>MSI has its RTX 5090-equipped <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/msi-Titan-18-HX-AI-A2XWJG-016US">Titan 18 HX AI</a> is up for preorder for an astounding $5,999.99. (That’s not even MSI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">ridiculous Dragon Edition Norse Myth</a>, which is still listed as “coming soon.”) The company has some of its slightly more down-to-Earth gaming laptops up for preorder as well, like the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Stealth-18-HX-AI-A2XWHG-029US">Stealth 18 HX AI</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti starting at $2,999.99.</p><p>Lots of these gaming laptops are sitting at the high end with high prices, and some are more expensive than their last-gen versions with 40-series GPUs. Like, previous generations we may have to wait until cheaper mobile GPUs are announced and brought to market to get something not priced into the stratosphere. Hopefully the mobile versions of Nvidia’s new cards won’t be saddled some of the problems that have hit its latest desktop class, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">mediocre improvements over their last-gen counterparts</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609920/rtx-5090-melting-power-connector-current-distribution">power issues</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">manufacturing missteps</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619414/samsung-9100-pro-gen-5-pcie-ssd-specs-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/quentyn-kennemer">Quentyn Kennemer</a> <span>is a writer who helps The Verge’s readers save money by surfacing the best tech deals and presenting the latest product recommendations from our experts. He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first PCIe Gen 5 SSDs from the likes of Seagate and Crucial began hitting the market nearly two years ago, but Samsung has been notably absent with its own model. That will change in March with the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-announces-9100-pro-series-ssds-with-breakthrough-pcie-5-0-performance/">arrival of the Samsung 9100 Pro series</a>, its first consumer-ready pure PCIe Gen 5 SSD built with NVMe 2.0. At launch, it will be available in 1TB (starting at $199.99), 2TB ($299.99), and 4TB ($549.99) capacities in an M.2 form factor, with or without heatsinks. An 8TB configuration, a first for Samsung NVMe SSDs, is slated for the second half of 2025.</p><p>By the numbers, the 9100 Pro’s theoretical maximum random read and write speeds — 2,200K and 2,600K input-output operations per second (IOPS) — are at least twice as fast as the last-gen Samsung 980 Pro, a PCIe Gen4 SSD. Our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743546/pcie-gen-5-ssd-nvme-drive-speed-test-comparison-hands-on">earliest comparison of that SSD</a> with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0BX4HGFGV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Seagate’s Firecuda 540</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-T700-Gen5-NVMe-CT1000T700SSD3/dp/B0C3K1QBSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Crucial’s T700</a> showed no noticeable benefits for PC gaming; however, the difference may be more evident for heavier computing workflows. If nothing else, it’d be nice to know you’re future-proofed, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879732/pcie-6-0-final-specification-bandwidth-speeds">until PCIe Gen 6 arrives</a>.</p><p>The gains might be more apparent if you’re talking about large-volume file transfers, though, which videographers or software engineers working with large datasets might appreciate. Samsung says the 9100 Pro (built on its V Nand TLC V8 with a custom controller) can reach sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8GBps and 13.4GBps, respectively. That’s roughly double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price">last-gen 980 Pro</a>, and about 2-3GBps per second faster than the earliest PCIe 5 SSDs can manage.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>It’s time to put all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">lessons I’ve learned about<em> Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha system</a> to the test. There’s <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/122">a new event coming</a> to the game and with that comes a new outfit I actually want this time. </p></div><p>After the game taught me an unfortunate lesson on the gacha economy, I’ve kinda taken it easy with <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, and have found myself enjoying it way more at a slower pace.</p><p>Updates come about once a month, and when I first started playing, I’d blaze through all the new and shiny quests within days only to spin my wheels at the tail end of the month desperate for something new to do. With that in mind, I slowly worked my way through all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year content</a>, completing everything I wanted mere hours before the event was due to wrap up. It feels like I’ve finally gotten into a steady rhythm with the game. I know how to play and how to spend and I’m happy again enjoying the game for what it is.</p><p>With the flashy fireworks in the distance, I took a look ahead to the next event, Eerie Season, due to start February 26th. It’s an oddly themed update. Typically games save their spooky events for October not March. But the community has been clamoring for more darker themed clothing since the overwhelming majority of the game’s items are pink and pastel so this seems like a response to that. The update will also flesh out the Queen’s Palace Ruins, an area of the game that’s visually interesting with its dilapidated and haunted castle vibe but devoid of any story or quest content. I am interested in poking at the darker bits of <em>Infinity Nikki’</em>s story and the overall lore of the world and Eerie Season seems poised to give me just what I’m looking for.</p><p>One of the things that’s helped me stick to my guns about not spending any extra money is the fact that premium outfits have never really moved me at all. Everything’s cute, of course, but nothing’s made me sit up and go “I must have this!” However, that apathy disappeared the moment I took a look at the premium outfits for Eerie Season.</p><p>I saw that cowboy outfit and audibly cursed. I’m from the midwest, we don’t have cowboys here. I don’t even like cowboys like that but … <em>I must have this</em>. So I’ve decided to apply all the tricks and tips I’ve learned about gacha game to acquiring this one outfit without spending any extra money. I think I’ll be able to do it, too. </p><p>After that rather frustrating lesson on exactly how gacha games can fleece even the most clear-eyed players, I haven’t spent any more money and have ignored the game’s clothing slot machine. As a result, I’ve amassed a small but tidy sum of premium currency, although not enough to get the cowboy outfit outright. After some light mathing, I’ve determined that I’ll need another 4,000 or so of the premium currency (or roughly $15). Thankfully, with what the battle pass and the new event quests will provide, I’m reasonably confident that I’ll have more than enough to get the entire outfit without any extra spending.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I’m excited about it. Not just because I’ll have an outfit that I truly want but also because there’s a thrill to making, executing, and succeeding with a plan. We’ll see how that goes when the new event starts February 26th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 features a similar asymmetrical stick layout to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">8BitDo’s original Ultimate controller that launched in 2022</a>, but adds additional buttons, interactive LED lighting, and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) joysticks that are even more durable than Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p>We still don’t know if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Nintendo will switch to Hall effect joysticks</a> for the Switch 2, but companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">GuliKit have already moved away from them</a> in favor of TMR. The technology has already long been used in hard drives to boost storage capacities. For controllers, it allows for joysticks that draw less power, which can improve battery life while nearly eliminating the risk of joystick drift that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">plagued the Nintendo Switch</a> and other modern controllers before magnetic Hall effect technology was adopted.</p><p>8BitDo is also bringing over the RGB Fire Ring lighting effects first introduced on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325092/8bitdo-ultimate-mini-wired-microsoft-xbox-controller-rgb-lighting">smaller-sized Ultimate C wired Xbox controller</a>. As the branding implies, both joysticks feature a ring of color-changing LEDs around their base with several lighting modes that react to button presses (including the triggers) or the direction the joysticks are being pushed.</p><p>The Ultimate 2’s triggers still use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and reliability, but 8BitDo has introduced a switch that lets you swap their behavior between longer draw triggers ideal for racing games and short pull tactile triggers for quicker responses while playing first-person shooters. And like the budget-minded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2c</a>, the Ultimate 2 has an extra pair of customizable shoulder buttons on the back.</p><p>The controller connects to 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2, which is also available as a mobile app, allowing buttons to be remapped and the sensitivity of joysticks and triggers to be adjusted. The controller has support for motion controls for games that support it, and a charging dock is still included.</p><p>Connectivity options include Bluetooth, a wired USB-C connection, or a low-lag 2.4GHz wireless connection using an included USB-C dongle. But like the cheaper Ultimate 2C, 8BitDo has only made its new Ultimate 2 controller compatible with PCs running Windows 10 and later or Android devices running Android 9.0 and newer.</p><p>Versions of the new Ultimate 2 compatible with the Xbox, iOS, or Nintendo Switch (and presumably the Switch 2) haven’t been announced yet, but 8BitDo previously released <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/">additional versions of the original Ultimate controller</a> with alternate compatibility.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
