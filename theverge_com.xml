            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290596/mass-effect-tv-show-amazon-fallout<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After its success with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a> and the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278893/amazon-like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-tv"><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> show</a>, <em>Mass Effect</em> is the next game Amazon wants to adapt. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/"><em>Variety</em></a>, a show based on BioWare’s military space opera RPG is officially in production at Amazon MGM Studios. <em>Variety</em> has reported that <em>F9: The Fast Saga </em>writer Daniel Casey has signed on to write the show with BioWare producer Mike Gamble serving as executive produce along with Ari Arad.</p><p>Though BioWare released the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></a> — a collection of the first three games updated for modern consoles — back in 2021, the <em>Mass Effect</em> series hasn’t had an original entry since the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em></a> back in 2017. After <em>Andromeda</em>, BioWare released <em>Anthem</em>, a live-service action game that was significant departure from the studio’s tradition of making single-player, story-driven RPGs. In 2020, BioWare announced that a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168973/mass-effect-returns-teaser-trailer-game-awards-2020"><em>Mass Effect</em> game was in-development</a>.</p><p>News of a <em>Mass Effec</em>t TV show comes on what is known as N7 Day, a semi-official, fan-created holiday that celebrates all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. On previous N7 Days, BioWare has teased information about the next game in the series including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951253/mass-effect-5-helmets-confirmed">a trailer that possibly suggested the return of fan-favorite protagonist Commander Shepard</a> whose story ended with the original trilogy. Though no story details have been revealed about the show, it’s a pretty safe bet to guess it’ll focus on the Commander and I personally can’t wait to see <em>her.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
