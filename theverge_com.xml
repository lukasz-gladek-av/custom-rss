IGN also reports that as a result of the cancellation, Cliffhanger Studios has been shut down.</p><p>Cliffhanger Studios <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/meet-cliffhanger-games">was a new games studio</a> created to develop <em>Black Panther</em> and run by Kevin Stephens who was the studio head for the now shuttered<em> Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> developer Monolith Studios. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787287/ea-black-panther-game-single-player">Beyond an initial announcement in 2023</a>, all that was known of <em>Black Panther</em> was that it was a single-player game with an original narrative and developed in collaboration with Marvel Studios. EA and Marvel announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23432986/ea-disney-marvel-iron-man-three-new-games-collaboration">a three-game partnership deal in 2022.</a> In addition to <em>Black Panther</em>, the other two games in the deal was an Iron Man title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">currently in production at Motive Studios</a>, and an as-yet unannounced action game.</p><p>According to IGN, the cancellation comes with layoffs in other sectors of EA’s business. The publisher recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667441/ea-return-to-office-work-hybrid">an RTO mandate</a> requiring employees come in at least three days a week and a round of layoffs occurred earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">impacting between 300 and 400 employees</a>. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p>The game’s cancellation does not spell the end for the hope of a Black Panther led title. Over at Skybound Entertainment, Amy Henning and team are working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/666270/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></em> which features Captain America and Black Panther as playable characters.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
