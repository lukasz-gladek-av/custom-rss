            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2984629/ram-is-so-expensive-that-stores-are-selling-it-at-market-prices.html">Michael Crider’s headline at <em>PCWorld</em> today</a> perfectly captures how ridiculous the PC memory shortage has become: stores like the San Francisco Bay Area’s Central Computers are beginning to sell RAM at market prices, like you’d pay for the catch-of-the-day at a seafood restaurant.</p><p>“Costs are fluctuating daily as manufacturers and distributors adjust to limited supply and high demand,” reads a message posted in the store’s display case, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevelin.bsky.social/post/3m6au5t2mks2w">as spotted by Steve Lin</a>. “Because of this, we can’t display fixed prices at this time.”</p><p>Micro Center is apparently doing the same: “Due to market volatility, we ask that you please see a Sales Associate for price,” reads an in-store message captured <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p55n8k/taken_at_microcenter_on_1123/">by Redditor CassTexas</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/shopping-for-ram-just-got-a-whole-lot-harder-in-2025-msrps-and-fixed-price-tags-disappear-as-some-stores-shift-to-spot-pricing">Tom’s Hardware</a></em>).</p><p>It’s hard to overstate just how quickly the RAM crunch is changing the affordability of computers — and it might soon impact other realms as well, as everything from game consoles <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/11/19/news-memory-crunch-hits-smartphones-xiaomi-warns-of-higher-2026-prices-samsung-under-memory-ap-pressure/">to smartphones</a> require RAM to function.</p><p>Three months ago yesterday, I bought 32GB of memory for my gaming PC and the price of that exact kit has more than tripled since then. It now costs $300 more. (<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/C2zp99/corsair-vengeance-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh32gx5m2b6000z30w?history_days=180">$440 vs. $130</a>, in case you’re curious; a more common version of the same kit went <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/KXV2FT/corsair-vengeance-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl36-memory-cmh32gx5m2e6000c36w?history_days=365">from $105 to $400</a>.) Some prices have doubled since October, and while you can still find some 32GB kits for as low as $230, a 64GB DDR5 kit can easily run you $700, $800, even $900.</p><p>Some high-profile product launches might be impacted by the price of memory. Valve pointed to the RAM crunch as <a href="http://Wait, Valve announced a console and won’t even say what it costs?">one reason it couldn’t promise a specific price</a> for its Steam Machine just yet.</p><div><p>Just as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">out-of-control GPU prices from earlier this year</a> have finally settled down, runaway memory prices might make them shoot back up again. Every graphics card requires gobs of VRAM, more is better, and word is that Nvidia and <a href="http://Digital Foundry is recommending you buy now">AMD are preparing to raise prices</a> to compensate for the crunch. <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/buy-now-gpu-prices-may-soon-explode"><em>Digital Foundry</em> is recommending</a> you buy a GPU at or below MSRP while you still can, one with 10GB or more of VRAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BORRBce5TGw">Leaker Moore’s Law Is Dead claims</a> that Microsoft may have to raise Xbox prices yet again to compensate, but that Sony has stockpiled enough RAM for the PS5 to last some number of months.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1992945140923847047?s=46">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says</a> it may take years for high-end gaming to recover from the RAM crunch, because of AI. He says “factories are diverting leading edge DRAM capacity to meet AI needs where data centers are bidding far higher than consumer device makers.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center]]></content:encoded>

Both Crocs feature the classic X, Y, B, A buttons, D-pad, left and right analog sticks, and even a white Xbox button and bumpers on the sides. The Xbox logo also appears on the ankle strap’s hinges.</p><p>Microsoft and Crocs are also releasing a <a rel="sponsored" href="https://crocs-us.xkpq.net/c/482924/3410272/8119?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crocs.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-5-pack-jibbitz-charms%2F10016884.html%3Fcgid%3Dxbox%26cid%3D001">five-pack of shoe charms</a> for $20, with characters and icons from <em>Halo</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Doom</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p><p>It’s all part of a collaboration between Crocs and Microsoft that marks 20 years since the Xbox 360 was first released.
