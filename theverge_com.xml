During its Direct livestream <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">Hades II</a>,</em> the follow-up to Supergiant Game’s phenomenal roguelike <em>Hades</em>, finally has a release date. Prepare to bring death to Chronos on Switch and PC September 25th.</p><p>During the Direct, <em>Hades II</em> revealed a splashy new animated trailer, reminiscent of <a href="https://youtu.be/Bz8l935Bv0Y?si=CtBPoGDqt7uU1dfL">the first <em>Hades</em> trailer</a>. It features Melinoë, <em>Hades II</em>’s protagonist and sister to Zagreus, the prince of hell who spent the first game trying to escape it. This time, Melinoë isn’t trying to leave hell, but break in to deal death to her grandfather, the god of time Chronos. As in <em>Hades</em>, Melinoë is aided in her quest by the gods, heroes of mythology, and the death-dealing power of her own two hands.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150249/hades-2-early-access-release-date-steam-egs">in early access on PC</a> for a little over a year now. The game has undergone several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access">chunky updates</a>, slowly adding new content and weapons in the lead-up to its full release. According to the Direct, <em>Hades II </em>will launch on Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 25th with a physical release launching in November. No word yet on when it’ll come to Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo announced that the platform will be coming to its collection of retro games available to Switch Online subscribers, and will be available on both the Switch and Switch 2.</p><p>The twist is that in order to play these games you’ll need a dedicated headset accessory, which looks just like the original hardware, but lets you slot in the Switch (or Switch 2) tablet for viewing the games. A cardboard model will also be available, which sounds similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18304954/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-review-switch-virtual-reality">the Labo VR headset.</a></p><p>A total of 14 games will be available through the service, including the likes of Mario Tennis and Tetris. Nintendo says they’ll be available starting February 17th, though the 14 games will be launching over time. It’s not clear yet when the headset accessories will be launching, nor how much they’ll cost.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777032/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-games#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777032/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-games]]></content:encoded>

It featured several charming design elements that mimicked the look of Astro, including shiny blue accents on the handles and buttons and big googly eyes on the touchpad. Unfortunately, it sold out quickly, and again after a subsequent restock.</p><p>The latest <strong>Astro Bot Joyful DualSense</strong> looks similar to the first model, complete with the blue grips and buttons and carved-in sci-fi lines. The most notable difference is the eyes on the touchpad are slightly squinting instead of fully open, giving it a more cutesy and joyful expression. Like last time, the eyes are drawn onto the touchpad and don’t actually emote. Otherwise, the Joyful edition offers the same haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, motion controls, and built-in microphone as a standard DualSense.</p><p>Resale listings for last year’s Astro Bot DualSense controller remain marked up on sites like eBay, making it impossible to find without paying well above the retail price. The good news is you don’t have to pay a premium on the Joyful version since PS5 accessories are unaffected by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro"> Sony’s recent price hikes</a>. However, we’re expecting it to sell out quickly like the previous version.
