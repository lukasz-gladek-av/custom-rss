But there are also a handful of other smaller showcases sprinkled throughout the week, including the Access-Ability Summer Showcase (June 6th at 11AM ET), Day of the Devs (June 6th at 7PM ET), the Wholesome Direct (June 7th at 12PM ET), and the PC Gaming Show (June 8th at 3PM ET). And that’s not including standalone events from PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>It’s a lot to keep track of, and you can follow along with the most important updates right here.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news#dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5MTEz">Shovel Knight’s creators are launching a new game this fall</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjgwNzMx">Killer Inn is Square Enix’s new ‘murder mystery action’ game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjgwNDMz">A Game of Thrones RTS is launching in 2026</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news#dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5NTQy">The Access-Ability Summer Showcase returns with the latest in accessible games</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>The band is back together.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228652/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-review-switch-stadia-ps4-xbox">There’s already one excellent Scott Pilgrim beat ‘em up,</a> and now we’re getting another.

The game will also feature the friend pass program where you and a buddy can play on one copy of the game.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The stop motion renaissance continues.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjgwNzMx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680731/killer-inn-square-enix-murder-mystery-action-game-trailer">Killer Inn is Square Enix’s new ‘murder mystery action’ game</a></h2><div><p>Square Enix <a href="https://youtu.be/sDoF1yyQxM0?feature=shared">just announced</a> <em>Killer Inn</em>, a new “murder mystery action” game, as part of Summer Game Fest on Friday.</p><p>In a <em>Killer Inn</em> match, 24 players are divided into two teams of “wolves” and “lambs,” and it’s the job of the lambs to discover and kill all the wolves or for the wolves to kill the lambs. (Just to be clear, you play as humans, but with the title of wolves or lambs.) When wolves kill a lamb, they’ll leave clues like a piece of hair or clothing that the lambs can use to try and identify the wolves.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680731/killer-inn-square-enix-murder-mystery-action-game-trailer">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I felt that.</p><p>One of the weirdest reveals so far is this puppet fighting game that has the energy of the 2018 movie <em>The Happytime Murders</em>.
