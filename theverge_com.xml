            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318706/pokemon-aardman-project<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264524/lets-stop-motion-and-take-another-look-over-the-garden-wall">Aardman Animation</a>, the studio behind the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271694/feathers-mcgraw-is-back-with-a-vengeance"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893091/netflix-chicken-run-sequel-dawn-of-the-nuggets"><em>Chicken Run</em></a>, and <em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, and <em>Chicken Run </em>franchises, is working with The Pokémon Company International on a mysterious new project.</p><p>In a surprising turn of events, TCPi and Aardman announced today that they’re teaming up for “a special project” that’s set to be released some time in 2027. In <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Aardman-Team-Up-for-Exciting-Collaboration-Coming-2027">a press release</a> about the collaboration, TCP marketing and media VP Taito Okiura described it as “a dream partnership for Pokémon.” Aardman’s managing director Sean Clarke added that it was both a huge honor and privilege to be tasked with presenting the Pokémon world in a new way.</p><p>“Bringing together Pokémon, the world’s biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting,” Clarke said. “Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world.”</p><p>Aside from the projected release year, there aren’t all that many details about what the collaboration is or how we’ll be able to consume it. Clearly, stop-motion claymation will be involved, but what’s less obvious is whether this will end up being a movie, a series, or perhaps a game — which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">wouldn’t be a first for Aardman</a>. This sort of team-up makes a lot of sense for TCPi after the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a><em> </em>and surprise delights like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24017505/pokemon-concierge-review-netflix"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em>. </em>And the closer we get to 2027, it’s feels like there’s a very strong chance this will be something that has people buzzing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
