Now until December 25th, for example, you can save up to $75 on the newer <strong>PS5 “slim”</strong> (now $424 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DJHF6Q9Z?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/xjkpy6p8gucga">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console-slim%2F-%2FA-90188801">Target</a>) and the <strong>PS5 Digital Edition </strong>(now $374 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/8ju5ctjya02r0">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Digital-Console-Slim%2F5113183757%2F">Walmart</a>).</p><p>If you already have a PS5 and are looking for new ways to play, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality"><strong>PlayStation VR 2</strong></a> is currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmLNtTk4a88">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-vr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle%2F-%2FA-88995903">Target</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23600772/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-sony-psvr2-review"><em><strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong></em></a> for $349 ($250 off), which may be tempting. The virtual reality headset is easy to set up and offers excellent PC-grade immersion, though its lineup still remains somewhat limited nearly two years after its release.</p><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>Sony sells a bundle consisting of its PSVR 2, controllers, and a physical copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>&nbsp;for the PS5.</p></div><p>Not into VR? It’s also a great time to pick up extra controllers, gaming headsets, and other PS5 accessories. Now until December 13th, Sony’s standard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"><strong>DualSense Wireless Controller</strong></a> is on sale for as low as $54 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSenseTM-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CQKLS4RP?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/pqqy8du894kfs">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5-midnight-black%2F-%2FA-83374958">Target</a>, while the reflective “Chroma” variants can be had for $59. There aren’t many PS5 controllers we’d recommend over the DualSense, namely because most third-party options lack the adaptive triggers and haptic engine, which add real tension to mirror your in-game actions.</p><p>You can also pick up Pulse-branded headsets throughout the same period, including the <strong>Pulse Elite</strong>, which is down to an all-time low of $129.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/ckX7ZN0AZg2">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Elite-Wireless-Headset%2F5113175920">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fgaming-headsets%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-pulse-elite-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-5%2F402800.html">GameStop</a>.

Both use planar magnetic drivers, which noticeably impact the 3D audio listening experience, along with a proprietary low-latency codec that works natively on PS5 consoles and Windows PCs with the included dongle. </p><p>If you’re looking to change up the look of your PS5, you can also pick up one of several <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fdeals%2Fholiday-accessories"><strong>Console Covers</strong></a> starting at $44.99 ($10 off).

You have to pay for all 12 months upfront, but that’s a great value for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146547/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition-complete">T-Mobile-owned MVNO carrier</a>. Just bring your phone, drop in the SIM card (or activate via eSIM), and you can connect to the same 4G LTE and 5G towers that T-Mobile customers do. Just be mindful that you’ll be slowed after using 40GB of data each month, and your video streaming will be limited to 480p.</li><li>It’s a little nippy out in many parts of the US, but the birds are still cutting through the chilly winds to get their food. Fortunately, you can keep watch on them from the warmth of your home with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23528786/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-ai-camera"><strong>Bird Buddy’s smart bird feeder</strong></a>, which is currently available for $199 ($20 off) <a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/product/smart-bird-feeder/">directly from Bird Buddy</a>.

It also uses a detachable solar roof, allowing it to stay powered indefinitely.</li><li>The <strong>Marshall Emberton II</strong>, a Bluetooth speaker that resembles a mini guitar amp, is on sale for $99.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B09XXW54QG?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/byrstky28sfap">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.marshall.com/us/en/product/1006788">Marshall’s online storefront</a>. While we haven’t reviewed the second-gen model yet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21308398/marshall-emberton-review-bluetooth-speaker-waterproof-specs-price">the original</a> offered a warm, bassy sound signature with well-balanced mids and highs. The sequel builds on it with IP67 water resistance while retaining up to 30 hours of battery life and the ability to sync with multiple units for an even bigger sound.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316130/apple-vision-pro-sony-psvr2-controller-support-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Vision Pro could gain support for Sony PSVR2 controllers soon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro?srnd=undefined">according to Mark Gurman</a> in today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter for <em>Bloomberg. </em>Apple and Sony apparently planned to announce support for the controllers “weeks ago” but have pushed back the rollout. Under this rumored partnership, Apple would begin selling Sony’s controllers, which aren’t currently available on their own.</p><p>Sony has apparently been working on adding the support for months, while Apple has asked third-party developers if they would take advantage of Sony’s VR controllers. That’s potentially great news for Vision Pro owners who wish the headset had more gaming chops. (There are precious few good, native visionOS games — <em>Thrasher, </em>a mesmerizing game where you fling a giant worm / dragon thing around a psychadelic space using just hand movements, comes to mind.) </p><p>Gurman writes that Apple also wants to use the controllers for more than gaming — the controllers will be able to navigate visionOS, and would offer more precise controls in apps like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop. Right now, you can pair a standard Bluetooth controller and navigate visionOS — tapping buttons to select things, scrolling with the analog sticks, and so on. They also work for gaming, but you’re mostly limited to iPad and iPhone games with controller support or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream">made-for-iOS emulators</a> or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/10/24217643/vision-pro-nintendo-virtual-boy-emulator-virtualfriend-impressions">native Virtual Boy one</a>.</p><p>Will this partnership bear fruit and help games actually flourish on the platform? I’m not immediately hopeful, given the Vision Pro’s sales and Apple’s track record of support from game publishers.</p><p>Still, the Vision Pro is fundamentally different from Apple’s other devices, and VR is its own landscape. And there are signs the community wants this, with at least one <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surreal-interactive/surreal-touch-1-controllers-for-apple-vision-pro">fully-funded Kickstarter project</a> to develop Meta Quest 3-style controllers, called the Surreal Touch, for the Vision Pro. Maybe the Vision Pro will get some great VR games — whether anyone will be around to buy them is another question entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
