The announcement comes a little over a month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">after the console’s previous delay</a>, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.</p><p>While the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.</p><p>“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”</p><p>The company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1958247804884677035">are available</a> for those who pre-ordered.</p><div><p>The Analogue 3D was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year</a>, and was delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">times</a> since then. The 3D — which promises to render N64 games in 4K and boasts 100 percent compatibility with the console’s library — is the latest project from the company, which has previously made high-end versions of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025]]></content:encoded>
