Two puzzles in, I can already tell you that I like it a lot.</p><p>The rules in <em>Mini Sudoku</em> are quite similar to regular sudoku: you need to fill in all of the blank spots of a puzzle with a number, but a number can’t repeat in a line, row, or box. But the twist with <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it uses six numbers instead of nine, meaning the game has smaller puzzles that are a little easier to take in across a mobile phone screen. You can also make notes and ask for hints if you need them.</p><p>The smaller puzzles have also (so far) been faster for me to solve. <em>The New York Times’</em> easy sudoku puzzle usually takes me more than five minutes to finish (could be a skill issue), and the first two <em>Mini Sukoku</em> puzzles have taken me about two and four minutes to complete, respectively. I know that’s not a huge jump, but every minute counts when I’m trying to finish a puzzle before my toddler wakes up in the morning.</p><p>The most annoying thing about <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it’s on LinkedIn, so it means I’ve found myself accidentally scrolling my LinkedIn feed. But I might have to learn to deal with that to finish my daily puzzle. I’m even thinking of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">trying LinkedIn’s other games</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758756/linkedins-mini-sudoku-is-a-clever-twist-on-the-classic-puzzle]]></content:encoded>
