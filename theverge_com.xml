Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve been itching to get a handheld, but the Switch 2 isn’t quite up your alley, now you can get your hands on a Steam Deck OLED. As spotted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lscg5aodzt2a">by @Wario64</a>, Valve has started selling the device <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%2F" rel="sponsored">on its online store</a> again after it was out of stock in the US and Canada for over a week.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock">Valve cited</a> “recent supply chain constraints” for the Steam Deck OLED’s unavailability, adding that it expects the device to come back in stock by the end of the summer. It looks like Valve may have resolved its supply chain issues — at least for now — as the 512GB Steam Deck OLED is currently on sale for $549, while the 1TB version is available for $649.</p><p>Both devices come with a 7.4-inch HDR OLED display, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, a carrying case, and battery life ranging from three to 12 hours, depending on content. The 1TB version adds a “premium anti-glare etched glass” display, a removable liner with the carrying case, and an exclusive startup screen and virtual keyboard theme. However, neither model includes the Steam Deck Docking Station, which is available separately for $79 (there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23776368/jsaux-rgb-dock-steam-deck-rog-ally-aya-neo">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843324/gulikit-steam-deck-rog-ally-dock-super-nintendo-snes-xbox-elite-gamepad">third-party</a> options out there, too.)</p><p>But if you’re still holding out for a Switch 2, the $450 console has been popping up intermittently at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691604/steam-deck-oled-valve-in-stock]]></content:encoded>
