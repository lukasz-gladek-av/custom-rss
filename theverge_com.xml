No matter what you choose from its <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/video-games-for-all" rel="sponsored">sale catalog</a>, you can get up to $30 off your order with the code <strong>LEVEL20</strong> used at checkout through the end of the day on February 27th (the sale lasts through March 5th, but the coupon ends beforehand). <strong>8BitDo’s highly customizable Pro 3 controller</strong> for Switch 2, PC and mobile devices is getting its biggest discount at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-for-switch-switch-2z" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>, selling for $39.99 (originally $69.99) with the code applied, or $49.99 without the code.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODMzNzAz"><p><span>$<!-- -->40</span></p><div><p>The Pro 3 features swappable ABXY face buttons and joystick caps, providing players with a highly customizable experience. It also features new L4 and R4 macro buttons between the triggers and its USB-C charging port, along with more durable and power efficient TMR joysticks.</p></div></div><p>The Pro 3 is a great, comfortable controller, and its swappable, magnetic face buttons are one of its top features. You can adjust the button layout from Switch to Xbox, or swap them for them for unlabeled button faces that are included with each controller. In terms of hardware features, the Pro 3 is similar to the Ultimate 2, packing TMR joysticks, triggers with adjustable stops, and extra macro buttons. One of the key differences, however, is that it has a PlayStation-style stick layout. It can wake the Switch 2, but its rumble performance is behind some of our favorite Switch 2 controllers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review.</a></p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Samsung debuted its new Galaxy S26 phones this week along with some new wireless earbuds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/884434/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-unpacked-2026-announcement">the Galaxy Buds 4 lineup</a>. There’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/883829/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-ultra-how-to-buy-preorder-price-release-date">great preorder deal on the S26 phone</a>, and you can also get a freebie with either of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5415Q27/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><strong>Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro</strong></a>. Amazon is offering a free gift card with both sets. The $179.99 Buds 4 include a $20 gift card — not bad — and the $249.99 Buds 4 Pro that offer improved sound and battery life include a $30 gift card with purchase.</span></li><li><span>AirTags are a great, compact Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users, but their Mentos-like shape may not be what you’re after. <strong>Ugreen’s FineTrack card-shaped tracker</strong> should fit easily into your wallet, and it’s down to $17.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5415Q27/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> (originally $29.99). It connects to Apple’s Find My network, just like AirTags and some other third-party trackers. It offers IP68 protection, and is rechargeable (via a proprietary cable included), offering up to one year of battery life per charge.</span></li><li><span>I’m on a streak of including QD-OLED gaming monitors in our roundups, and I’m keeping it going with a refurbished deal on <strong>MSI’s 27-inch 1440p model that has a 240Hz refresh rate</strong>. You can snag one at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F146400024938" rel="sponsored">eBay</a> through a seller that has great ratings for $369.99 (typically priced at $429.99 or so in new condition). I got my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday">hands on this 271QPX E2 model</a> to test ahead of Black Friday when it sold at Costco for $379.99 — a price that hasn’t returned since. It offers multiple video inputs, including DisplayPort, HDMI, as well as USB-C. This purchase includes a two-year warranty covered by Allstate.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/885192/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-switch-2-pc-galaxy-buds-4-pro-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>
