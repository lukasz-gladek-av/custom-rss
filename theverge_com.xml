            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roblox is going to block kids from accessing certain types of experiences following reports alleging that the platform has enabled child abuse.</p><p>One new measure will stop kids under 13 from accessing experiences with “certain types of interactive features,” Roblox says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">in a post on its developer forum</a>. Those include “social hangouts,” where the primary purpose is to communicate with others over text or voice chat, and “free-form 2D user creation” experiences, where players can do things like draw on a chalkboard or whiteboard. This change goes into effect beginning November 18th.</p><p>Another change stops kids under 13 from playing, searching for, or being able to discover unrated experiences. This change goes into effect after December 3rd. If a creator wants to let a player under 13 access their game, they will have to complete a questionnaire and make sure that all of the information regarding their experience meets Roblox’s requirements for its current All Ages or 9 plus ratings. Roblox says it will start enforcing those requirements “next year.”</p><p>There have been multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">recent stories</a> about Roblox’ allegedly poor protections for children, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">a <em>Bloomberg</em> article</a> titled “Roblox’s Pedophile Problem.” In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">changes for pre-teen users</a> and a new type of account to let parents manage their kids on Roblox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
