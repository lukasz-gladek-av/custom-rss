He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When I have to decide which wireless gaming earbuds that I want to use, it’s a tough choice between the <strong>SteelSeries Arctis Buds</strong> and the Sony InZone Buds. Both have a comfortable fit, active noise cancellation, great sound quality, and their USB-C transmitters work with every non-Xbox platform in my apartment. But it’s easy to tell you which of the two you should buy right now, if you’re in the market: SteelSeries’ Arctis Buds in white with PlayStation wireless connectivity are down to $127.99 ($73 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX34VNZ/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — their best price yet. (This model originally sold for $159.99, but it was likely increased due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">increased tariffs</a>). Even so, they’re considerably cheaper than Sony’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJHB7B59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$228</a> InZone Buds.</p><p>The Arctis Buds can connect to one of many devices with its 2.4GHz transmitter, from your PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch 2. (A <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX4TPS6/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">pricier $165.99 version</a> in black works with Xbox and all of the aforementioned platforms.) If you need them more as earbuds for joining a call or listening to a podcast from your phone, you can pair them via Bluetooth 5.3. Whether you’re gaming or jamming away, these feature active noise cancellation to block out more sound. They have a transparency mode, too, letting you hear more of your surroundings.</p><p>Some additional perks include its Qi wireless case, which can recharge on the same wireless charging pad you might use for your AirPods Pro or a different set of earbuds. The earbuds can last about 10 hours per charge, slightly less if you’re using active noise cancellation. (Our reviewer Tom Warren got nine hours of life from them with ANC on.) Almost every set of wireless earbuds has limitations, and this model’s biggest one is that it can’t pipe in audio from its 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections simultaneously. It’s one or the other.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p id="some-other-deals-for-your-friday"><h2>Some other deals for your Friday</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Amazon Prime members who are building a PC or just looking for deals on midrange GPUs can save on <strong>MSI’s RTX 5070</strong> with 12GB of VRAM. The GPU had an original MSRP of $549, but this two-fan model is selling for $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-RTX-5070-12G-Performance/dp/B0DYGFJK7C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its lowest price yet. The Shadow 2X OC has a slightly faster 2,557MHz boost clock speed versus Nvidia’s Founders Edition model, and its design is slightly more compact (but more plastic-laden). It’s otherwise the same in terms of ports (three DisplayPort 2.1a, one HDMI 2.1b) and capabilities. It’s a solid GPU for playing most games at 1440p with respectable frame rates, even if turning on DLSS 4 is necessary to get the super-fast performance you may be hoping for.</span></li><li><span>Lego’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/1/24169526/lego-minecraft-the-crafting-table-15th-anniversary-adult-set">first <em>Minecraft</em> set for adults</a>, <strong>The Crafting Table</strong>, is down to an all-time low of $71.99 ($18 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minecraft-Crafting-Collectible-Anniversary/dp/B0CRX64YFN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-minecraft-21265%2F-%2FA-90573727" rel="sponsored">Target</a>. The 1,195-piece kit essentially resembles an in-game crafting table on the outside, but inside, you’ll find a slick little diorama with 12 brick-ified biomes — including a village-laden Plains and Cherry Grove, which features an abandoned mineshaft. You also get eight tiny microfigures, because what’s <em>Minecraft</em> without a Creeper?</span></li><li><span>Those who are hoping to get a 55-inch 4K OLED TV for well under $1,000 won’t find many models out there at that price point. However, you can still take advantage of the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-55-Class-4K-UHD-OLED-Web-OS-Smart-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-B4-Series-OLED55B4PUA%2F5446374203" rel="sponsored">Walmart-exclusive deal</a> on the <strong>55-inch LG B4</strong>. You can get it for $798, which is about $200 less than the price you can typically find it available for. Even though the B-series is LG’s entry-level OLED model, it has some of the most important traits in common with its pricier next of kin; you’ll get four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing any of them to display your games in 4K at up to 120Hz, if supported. Plus, it supports variable refresh rate (VRR), which allows the panel’s refresh rate to stay in lockstep with the connected gaming device’s output to eliminate the chance of screen tearing. For movie lovers, this TV supports Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG, ensuring that most of your content will pop with color.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/801041/steelseries-arctis-buds-rtx-5070-gpu-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

It’s a new take on Mattel’s Intellivision, which initially went head-to-head with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">Atari 2600</a> when it was released in 1979.</p><p>The Sprint looks a lot like the original Intellivision with a gold and black case and a wood-grain panel on the front, but there are a lot fewer cables. It connects to a TV using a single HDMI cable, and while it still includes two controllers featuring dials and number pads instead of joysticks, they’re both wireless and charge when docked to the console.</p><p>The Sprint has the original Intellivision’s number pad overlays, but with new designs and updated artwork to make it easier to know what buttons you need to press to play different games. It comes with 45 built-in titles, including classics like <em>Boulder Dash</em> and <em>Astrosmash</em>, plus a collection of sports games that helped popularize the original version of the console. It lacks support for cartridges, but there’s USB-A ports that can be used to play additional titles or to connect original Intellivision controllers with an adapter.</p><p>It’s available for preorder starting today for $149.99 and is expected to ship on December 5th, 2025.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/801646/atari-intellivision-sprint-console-competition]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/801563/keeper-review-xbox-double-fine</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-weirdo-xbox-game-about-a-walking-lighthouse-is-a-keeper.1327903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s a testament to the developers at Double Fine that it doesn’t take long before controlling a sentient lighthouse with spidery legs starts to feel almost normal. <em>Keeper</em>, the latest from the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9878278/psychonauts-2-tim-schafer-interview"><em>Psychonauts</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7877417/grim-fandango-remastered"><em>Grim Fandango</em></a>, is obviously a strange game. You play as a building that can walk and solve puzzles and which befriends a cute bird while on a quest to rid a fantastical realm of an encroaching darkness. It’s like a cross between the wordless storytelling of <em>Wall-E</em> and the cinematic platforming of <em>Limbo</em>, with a psychedelic splash of Lisa Frank’s paints coating it all. It’s also a game that proves to be much more than it first seems. Somehow, things get even <em>weirder</em>.</p><p>Things start out simple. For unexplained reasons, you, a lighthouse, sprout legs and start stumbling about. There’s not much you can do aside from walk — awkwardly, at that — and point your big spotlight at things. Quickly enough, and after maybe accidentally crushing a few houses as you learn how to move, you’ll meet a big bird who immediately becomes your best friend. All you can do is keep moving forward, and as you do, you’re pulled into a strange world that’s clearly in need of help.</p><p>When you first start out, <em>Keeper</em> plays like a very linear kind of puzzle game. You walk down set paths so you can’t really get lost, and there are simple obstacles in your way. In most cases, you can trigger a magical switch or eliminate a hazardous impediment by shining your light on it. I’m glad the game starts slow because it took some getting used to; unlike most modern games, <em>Keeper</em> has a fixed camera, and you instead use the right stick to rotate the light at the top of the lighthouse.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Double Fine Productions</cite></p></div><p>From there, things slowly but surely open up. Even with only a few actions at your disposal, the puzzles can get surprisingly complex. You’ll be sending off your bird to collect items and flip switches and even messing around with the flow of time. <em>Keeper </em>manages to squeeze a lot out of its limited vocabulary — and then suddenly, it becomes something very different, multiple times. I don’t want to spoil anything because these moments are some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, but eventually, you’ll be able to jump and swim and, I kid you not, by the end the game, it resembles something like <em>Tony Hawk</em>. And along with this, the world similarly expands, giving you more space to explore.</p><p>And really, that world is the heart of <em>Keeper</em>. The puzzles are just there to give you something to do while you take it all in. It’s a strange, colorful, vibrant place, one teeming with life (though there’s not a human in sight). There are giant creatures made out of trees and adorable baby turtles the size of school buses. At one point, you have to find your way out of a clockwork town populated by little robots on wheels; later, you’re traversing caves that pulse with a hideous kind of life. Even though you’re a piece of architecture, <em>Keeper</em> makes you feel a part of this world, like you’re making it better over time. You also make a lot of cute friends who stick around to help when things get tough.</p><p>I put <em>Keeper</em> in the same category as experiences like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a>, where playing them is just a means to an end, and that end is moving through an imaginative, bizarre, and constantly changing space. The clever puzzles and strange forms of movement are just ways for me to feel more a part of the world. By the end of the game, which lasts just long enough to not overstay its welcome, it was almost hard to imagine I ever thought a walking lighthouse was weird at all. <em>Almost</em>.</p><p><sub>Keeper <em>is available October 17th on Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801563/keeper-review-xbox-double-fine]]></content:encoded>
