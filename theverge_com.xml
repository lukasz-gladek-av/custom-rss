            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">LG announced</a> its CES 2025 lineup of monitors, Samsung is doing the same. The company just introduced several new models, and perhaps the most impressive among them is the Odyssey OLED G81SF. It’s a 27-inch 4K monitor with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, 0.03ms response time, a glare-free display, and rear-core lighting with 52 color options. Samsung is also including a number of burn-in protection measures to ensure that the Odyssey G81SF’s screen looks pristine for years to come. The G8 is likely to be using the latest and greatest OLED panel from Samsung Display.</p><p>Next up is the Odyssey OLED G60SF — also a 27-inch OLED monitor — with a QHD resolution and an impressive 500Hz refresh rate that Samsung says effectively “eliminates lag and motion blur for ultra-smooth gameplay during critical moments.”</p><p>In 2025, Samsung is also finally shipping the Odyssey 3D monitor it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first teased at least year’s CES</a>. It lets you experience 3D visuals <em>without</em> any special glasses by using a lenticular lens on the front panel. “Eye tracking monitors the movement of both eyes using a built-in stereo camera, while view mapping continuously adjusts the image to enhance depth perception,” Samsung said in its press release. The Odyssey 3D only comes in a 27-inch 4K size; the larger 37-inch display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">mentioned last year</a> has apparently been scrapped. The company says it offers “a rapid 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and a 165Hz refresh rate.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Smart Monitor series is making the switch to OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>That does it for the gaming-focused monitors, but Samsung is also announcing two others that are more focused on everyday productivity. The SmartMonitor series is finally going OLED with the new Smart Monitor M9. And this year, Samsung is throwing in a ton of AI capabilities including AI Picture Optimizer. Like on its TVs, this feature “analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed — such as gaming, video, or productivity applications — and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.” This also works for gaming and can detect the genre of what you’re playing.</p><p>AI Upscaling Pro can make lower-res content look crisper at the M9’s 4K resolution, and the monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. That’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">significant upgrade from the M8</a>, which topped out at 60Hz. Samsung says moving to OLED also allows for a new “ultra-slim” design for the Smart Monitor M9 that should take up considerably less desk space.</p><p>The last monitor being announced (at least for today) is the new 37-inch ViewFinity S8. It’s got a 16:9 aspect ratio, built-in KVM switch, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Peak brightness for this 4K LCD display tops out at 350 nits, which should be perfectly suitable for anything you’ll be doing at a desk.</p><p>Pricing and release dates are still to come, but <em>The Verge</em> will be in Las Vegas for CES 2025 in a matter of days. So you won’t have to wait much longer for some first-hand impressions of Samsung’s new monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
