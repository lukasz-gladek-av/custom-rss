            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077’s</em> <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">Update 2.3</a>, set to launch on Thursday for Mac, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X / S, will add a bunch of new features focused around vehicles and proper VRR support on consoles.</p><p>The new AutoDrive feature, available in all cars and motorcycles, lets you drive from place to place automatically. You can set where you want to go on the game’s map, including driving directly to where you need to go for a quest. (The feature only works on roads, though.) You can also use AutoDrive in a “wandering” mode that lets the car just drive around on its own.</p><p>While AutoDrive is on, you can turn on a “cinematic camera” mode to see some more dramatic shots. And if you’d prefer to get a taxi ride from the Delamain AI, that’s an option in Update 2.3 as well once you’ve completed a specific quest.</p><p>With Update 2.3, CD Projekt Red (CDPR) is also adding official in-game support for VRR on both PS5 and Xbox that can help with screen tearing when the frame rate drops. It was already supported at the system level, but the game’s makers say that implementing VRR properly should improve the experience, which can come in handy when you’re running in performance mode on consoles.</p><p>On PC, the update adds support for AMD FSR 3.1, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR 10 Plus. Support for AMD’s FSR 4 is being added, too, but you won’t be able to turn it on in-game until you’ve installed the driver that supports it, and that driver won’t be available until a “later date,” CDPR says.</p><p>The game will launch on Mac <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing">on Thursday</a>, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing">you’ll need</a> an Apple Silicon Mac with at least 16GB of unified memory to be able to play it. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was also a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, and Update 2.3 will come to the platform “at a later date.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708381/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-autodrive-vrr-consoles-patch]]></content:encoded>
