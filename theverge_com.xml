            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Spotify may have popularized the Wrapped user recap trend, but more companies are jumping on that bandwagon every year. From rival music streaming providers like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Deezer, to completely unrelated services across tech, gaming, and other industries, a huge range of companies are using fun visuals, stats, and personalization features to show how you’ve been using their platforms over the last 12 months.</p><p>The annual recaps trend shows no sign of slowing down, prompting companies to introduce new features every year to keep things fresh. Spotify Wrapped 2025 has added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">interactive Wrapped Party feature</a> that makes a game out of comparing your listening habits against your friends, for example, while YouTube has launched a separate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">Recap review for video insights</a>, alongside its usual Music Recap.</p><p>This is also the time of year when companies drop their “best of” rankings charts for the year, charting the most downloaded apps across Apple and Google’s app stores, the most streamed music, movies, and TV shows, and more.</p><p>We’re rounding up all the biggest or most intriguing recaps for 2025 below as they’re announced, so check back to see how the services you’re using will be breaking down your data this year.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM3MTc3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837177/google-photos-2025-recap-selfie-count">Google Photos Recap will tell you how many selfies you took this year</a></h2><div><p>Google has added some new features to its end-of-year Photos app throwback experience, including a selfie count, CapCut integration, and photo curation capabilities. The Google Photos Recap includes insights and graphics that summarize what users have been snapping over the year, and follows the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314709/google-photos-2024-recap-memories-spotify-wrapped">updated presentation format</a> Google introduced in 2024, which looks like a closer riff on Spotify Wrapped to me.</p><p>The Recap is available starting today. It will appear in the Google Photos Memories carousel and then be pinned in the Collections tab throughout December.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837177/google-photos-2025-recap-selfie-count">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM3MTI3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">Spotify Wrapped 2025 turns listening into a competition</a></h2><div><p>It’s time for year-end lists, annual roundups, and, of course, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/">Spotify Wrapped</a>. The usual suspects are here, like your most listened to song, your total time listened, and your favorite artist. You also get your 2025 Wrapped playlist, which now shows how many times you listened to each of your top 100 tracks this year. But, as usual, Spotify is also adding a ton of new stuff to its annual tradition, including <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-party-how-to/">Wrapped Party</a>, which pits you against your friends to see who is the bigger (or weirder) music fan.</p><p>Wrapped Party is an interactive feature that you “play” with friends. Granted, there isn’t much to actually do, since it’s mostly about what you’ve already listened to. You can’t go back in time and listen to a more obscure song than your friends, or retroactively listen to more horror audiobooks. Still, turning listening to music into a competitive sport is definitely a new twist on the annual Wrapped tradition.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837127/spotify-wrapped-party-2025-music-competition">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM2NjEz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836613/apple-music-replay-2025-listening-stats-launch">Apple Music Replay 2025 is back with new listening stats</a></h2><div><p>Apple Music is getting ahead of Spotify Wrapped with the <a href="https://www.threads.com/@davidemery/post/DRxBR1VDTu0?xmt=AQF06UFNVYaw1syrayifMOkRYb8ays6HhD6UMyKBmArueg">launch of its yearly recaps</a>. This year’s Apple Music Replay is available natively within the app and comes packed with even more listening stats, allowing you to review all the new artists you listened to, which ones you kept returning to, and who made a comeback in your playlist.</p><p>It also highlights your most-listened-to songs, how many artists you listened to, your favorite genres, and how much time you spent listening to music on the app. There’s a shareable highlight reel as well, which you can post to apps like Instagram and TikTok. Apple already offers monthly music recaps and the ability to review <em>all</em> your listening stats, but it’s always fun to see how your taste has evolved throughout the year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836613/apple-music-replay-2025-listening-stats-launch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODM2MTcz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">YouTube introduces its own version of Spotify Wrapped for videos</a></h2><div><p>YouTube is rolling out a new roundup experience that lets you quickly review your most notable video habits over the last year. The Recap feature “uniquely highlights interests, deep dives, and moments” based on your watch history, according to YouTube’s announcement, providing up to 12 cards that spotlight top channels, interests, and how your taste in videos has changed over time.</p><p>It appears similar to Spotify’s end-of-year Wrapped experience, which other services like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311987/apple-music-2024-recap-available-app">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312045/from-spotify-wrapped-to-amazon-music-delivered">Amazon Music</a> have also riffed on in recent years. YouTube’s Recap feature will even assign users a “personality type” based on viewing habits, such as Adventurer, Skill Builder, and Creative Spirit — which seem comparable to Spotify’s listening personality types.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836173/youtube-recap-videos-eoy-review-wrapped">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Amazon Music Delivered puts your top tunes on a festival poster.</p><p>The service is back <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-music-delivered-streaming-insights">with another yearly recap</a>, and this time, it will create a personalized festival poster based on your most-played artists, tracks, and genres, while displaying other insights.

            <title><![CDATA[An unsettling indie game about horses keeps getting banned from stores]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store</link>
            <guid>1371862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Horses</em>, a first-person narrative horror game, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zgqun5us2f">was banned from the Epic Games Store</a> just hours before it was set to launch on December 2nd. Then, a day after launch, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">the Humble store banned it as well</a>. The decision shocked the developers at Santa Ragione, makers of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/">critically respected <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, as these storefronts were the homes they’d found for their game two years before it was preemptively banned from Steam.</p><p>Valve and Epic say <em>Horses</em> violates their sexual content policies. Humble hasn’t yet said why it banned the game after hosting it for several hours post-launch. However, Santa Ragione claims neither Epic nor Valve has clearly explained what exactly in the game is objectionable, and that these decisions have put the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">in peril of shutting down</a>. The back-and-forth has catapulted <em>Horses</em> from a little-known prestige indie title to the next battleground in the fight between game storefronts, indie developers, content policies, and creative expression.</p><p>Though all the action kicked off late last month, <em>Horses</em>’ story officially began two years ago. In <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">a lengthy FAQ</a>, the developers explained that in 2023, <em>Horses</em> was rejected during Steam’s review process without explanation. “Steam’s policy grants broad discretion to refuse titles without providing detailed explanations. In our case, they simply stated they could not legally distribute <em>Horses</em> without clarifying why,” the FAQ reads.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">In an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Pietro Righi Riva, one half of the team at Santa Ragione, said that the ban might have been caused by a scene involving a man and his daughter visiting a ranch where the titular “horses” are humans wearing horse masks. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses, which the player facilitates. “What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders,” Riva said.</p><p>He said that scene was part of a rough demo sent to Steam to satisfy the platform’s request for a playable build so <em>Horses</em> could get a “Coming Soon” page. Riva said that, ultimately, the character was changed in the final build. “We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of <em>Horses</em>, works much better when delivered by an older character.”</p><div><p>“Our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over.”</p></div><p>The studio stresses that Steam never explicitly explained why <em>Horses</em> was banned nor responded to any of Santa Regione’s follow-up appeals and communications. “For two years we asked for clarifications and a path to compliance, but we were directed to Steam’s general guidelines and our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>In November, after Santa Ragione <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23">shared <em>Horses</em>’ release date</a> and the reason why it wouldn’t be sold on Steam, Valve finally responded. A <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam">statement to <em>gamedeveloper.com</em> read</a>:</p></div><p>“After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/tmWlCn5YzpcKpL21nF9fACJhfDX?domain=partner.steamgames.com">our onboarding rules and guidelines</a>. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”</p><p>The studio says the Steam ban put the company in financial peril, as it “completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable.” Though the developers were able to continue work on <em>Horses</em> through investments from friends, unless the game’s a hit, they say the studio will shut down.</p><p>In the two years since <em>Horses</em>’ ban from Steam, Santa Ragione found several new homes for the game, including Itch.io, GOG, Humble, and the Epic Games Store. <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">In a post on X</a>, DRM-free storefront GOG said, “We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game. We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.” Humble, however, banned the game shortly after its launch there and has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>None of those stores has near the market share of Steam, but among them, Epic’s has the most name recognition — making its last-minute ban a major blow.</p><p>As with Steam, Epic didn’t explain what in <em>Horses </em>triggered the ban, only referring to the policy on inappropriate and hateful / abusive content and the fact that games rated AO, or Adults Only, could not be distributed on EGS. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Unless it’s an NFT / blockchain game, of course.</a>)</p><p>“We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels,” the developers’ FAQ reads, adding that when <em>Horses </em>was submitted to the ESRB for rating, it received an Mature rating (ages 17 and up), which is, as of this writing, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">still prominently displayed on the game’s EGS page</a>. Epic did not respond to a request to clarify the age rating discrepancy or the timing of the ban, referring instead to the statements Santa Ragione shared in its FAQ.</p><p>Santa Ragione is very clear about the kind of content <em>Horses </em>contains. The lengthy content warning <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">on the game’s website</a> lists “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.” It also makes sense that, out of an abundance of caution, Steam would ban the version of the game it saw with the father-and-daughter scene.</p><p>“The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. But what makes less sense is the platform’s refusal to reevaluate the game or at least explain its reasoning. “We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment,” reads the FAQ.</p><p>According to Santa Ragione, Epic’s ban is even more confusing. It said EGS had a more complete version of the game for two months, “with the final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch.” Epic’s decision to ban<em> Horses</em> reads like decision-makers getting scared in light of all the attention on the game.</p><p>In spite of all this, <em>Horses</em> still is available, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">smattering</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviews</a> have been mostly positive. But with large storefronts having significant power over games and studios, the reception may not be enough to keep Santa Ragione alive. The studio says that the combination of the Steam ban and the money it owes investors “puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>
