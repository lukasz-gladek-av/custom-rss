            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/672037/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-activision-retro-classics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/wes-davis">Wes Davis</a> <span>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/21/xbox-may-update-retro-classics-pc-gaming-updates/">announced</a> that a new “Retro Classics” collection is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fretro-classics%2F9MTVJ3HHTQGS" rel="sponsored">now available</a> to Game Pass subscribers. Reminiscent of the Nintendo Switch Online classic games library, the collection includes <em>Pitfall, Grand Prix, </em>and more than 50 other Activision titles from the 1980s and 1990s. It’s not as many titles as the 1,300 retro games that Antstream, Microsoft’s partner in the offering, has available on its streaming service, but it won’t cost Game Pass subscribers any extra.</p><p>Retro Classics, which Microsoft writes is part of its “commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility, is available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via Xbox cloud gaming on compatible devices like some LG and Samsung smart TVs, and the Meta Quest headset. Other games included in the collection include <em>Cosmic Ark, Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, </em>and <em>Atlantis.</em></p><p>Based on screenshots, it looks like the collection will include titles from the original PlayStation, the SNES, MS-DOS, and more. Players will be able to collect achievements and participate in events like tournaments and community challenges, as well. Microsoft says this is only the start: the collection will expand to include more than 100 games from Activision and Blizzard, eventually. Like Nintendo’s retro collection, you’re out of luck if you don’t have Microsoft’s gaming subscription, as the titles in the collection aren’t available for sale separately.</p><p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://www.antstream.com/post/xbox-launches-retro-classics-for-game-pass-powered-by-antstream">separately announced</a> a temporary deal for Game Pass subscribers. Until June 4th, members can sign up for a year of access to Antstream’s library, which includes more than 1,300 games, for $9.99 via the Microsoft Store.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
