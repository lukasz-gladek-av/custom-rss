            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what’s next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg’s compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and — much like the Grande concert — the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>’s strange history. Eminem’s sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game’s mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD’s songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game’s next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD’s new animated music video for “Empty Out Your Pockets,” which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game’s next mainline season. It’s called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">Hunters</a>,” and it kicks off on December 1st with new additions like Godzilla and Baymax, along with a completely new battle royale island. Here’s the first trailer:</p><div><p>While the Chapter 2 event is over, <em>Fortnite</em> isn’t done with the nostalgia. Epic is bringing back <em>Fortnite </em>OG — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">a throwback to the game’s original map</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">as a permanent fixture on December 6th.</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
