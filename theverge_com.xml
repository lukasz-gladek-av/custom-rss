            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I’ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki’s Attack Vector <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l7hpz6/warning_for_switch_2_owners_who_bought_an_attack/">has problems</a>, which the company is now reworking. It’s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand’s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.</p><p>I adored the kit when I tested it on my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23373094/dbrand-project-killswitch-steam-deck-case-magnet-stand">Steam Deck</a>, and this one doesn’t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn’t fit in Nintendo’s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It’s a little clunky, but I’m mainly just happy that it works, so I don’t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.</p><p>The most basic “Essentials” kit is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$59.95</a> and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2’s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch’s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Each component that attaches to the Switch 2 is malleable enough to easily fit onto its pieces, but secure enough not to wiggle off.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$79.85</a> “Travel” option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I’ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.</p><p>The most expensive <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$99.80</a> “Ultra” kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn’t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Killswitch secures to the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 with a small lip that keeps it on. And yet, it’s simple to remove if you want to.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Killswitch is great. I often forget that it’s installed. I thought I’d miss the console’s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I’m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From there, look for the “Client Beta Participation” heading, and select <strong>Steam Beta Update</strong> from the dropdown menu.
