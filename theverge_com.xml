He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AMD’s FSR 4 AI upscaling and frame-generation technology can now be enabled for “most games that support FSR 3.1 with DirectX 12,” the company says in <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-9-1.html">the patch notes</a> for its newest 25.9.1 driver. This support has been a big promise from AMD, but it’s taken awhile to come to fruition; FSR 4 first launched alongside the company’s RX 9000-series graphics cards back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu">in March</a>.</p><p>AMD touts FSR 4, its competitor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Nvidia’s DLSS 4</a>, as a “significant leap forward” over FSR 3. “By utilizing ML algorithms, FSR 4 can intelligently predict and compensate for lost pixels during low-resolution rendering, thereby providing gamers with high performance and crisp, high-definition visuals that are just as good as native,” <a href="https://gpuopen.com/news/amd-fsr4-over-85-games/">AMD says</a>.</p><p>The new driver brings official FSR 4 support to cover more than 85 titles. But for FSR 3.1 games, you can force FSR 4 by flipping a toggle in the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition app. “This last step allows the driver to override the FSR 3.1 game implementation with the latest version of FSR 4,” according to AMD.</p><div><p>FSR 4 support has slowly been trickling out to games since its release, including being added to titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719000/you-can-now-use-amds-fsr-4-while-playing-cyberpunk-2077"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663571/more-games-now-support-fsr-4"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>F1 25</em></a>.</p></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774142/amd-fsr-4-3-1-games-support-upscaling#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774142/amd-fsr-4-3-1-games-support-upscaling]]></content:encoded>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has notched another victory in its crusade against piracy. Last week, a Washington District Court judge <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26086297-nintendo-v-modded-hardware/">ordered Ryan Daley</a> to pay Nintendo $2 million and stop selling modded Switch consoles online, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-wins-a-2-million-lawsuit-against-popular-switch-modding-webstore-174528989.html">reported earlier by <em>Engadget</em></a>.</p><p>In a copyright lawsuit filed last year, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">Nintendo accused</a> Daley of operating the website Modded Hardware, which sold modded Switch consoles, modchips used to hack into Switch devices, and Mig flash cartridges that allow people to play pirated copies of games.</p><p>Nintendo claimed Daley caused the company “significant and irreparable harm” — and the judge agreed. “The MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale,” the ruling states. Daley denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Piracy lawsuits from Nintendo have become increasingly common, with the company winning its case <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624618/nintendo-piracy-lawsuit-1fichier">against a file-sharing site</a> accused of hosting pirated games earlier this year. Nintendo’s legal actions have led to the shutdown of Switch emulators, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">including Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx</a>. The company has also made it clear that it may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665765/nintendo-privacy-policy-update-switch-2">brick Switch 2 consoles</a> if players try to mod the device.</p><p>Daley, who chose to fight Nintendo without a lawyer, is now banned from modding Switch consoles, as well as from using devices designed to circumvent the console’s security measures. The judge also ordered the seizure, impoundment, or destruction of all devices owned by Daley that may contain copyright-infringing material.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774077/nintendo-switch-modder-ryan-daley-lawsuit#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774077/nintendo-switch-modder-ryan-daley-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>
