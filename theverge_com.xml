Jim Kjellin, the CTO of <em>Great Circle</em> developer MachineGames, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313654/bethesda-fixed-the-typos-on-indiana-jones-pc-specs-and-answered-our-question-about-ray-tracing">gave us a reason</a> for as to why that’s the case:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> uses a technique called global illumination to light the environment and characters. Our engine MOTOR, used by MachineGames, uses hardware raytracing to calculate this. While this isn’t what players may typically think of as “ray tracing,” the compatible hardware is required to do this is in a performant, high fidelity way.</p></blockquote></div><div><p><em>Great Circle</em> will also be available on Xbox Series X / S, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">coming to PS5 in spring 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313251/verizon-admin-and-telco-recovery-charge-fee-increase"><h2>Verizon is once again raising its fees</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"><h2>Sam Altman lowers the bar for AGI</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"><h2>OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘shipmas’ include Sora and new reasoning model</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312920/martial-law-south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-protest-dispatch"><h2>Six hours under martial law in Seoul</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312938/google-veo-generative-ai-video-model-available-preview"><h2>Google’s new generative AI video model is now available</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
