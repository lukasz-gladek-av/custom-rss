            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/654718/fbc-firebreak-release-date-remedy-control<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The summer of video game releases is starting to heat up. Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">Control</a></em>, announced that its first multiplayer title <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/651425/a-rough-day-at-the-office">FBC: Firebreak</a></em> will launch on June 17th. It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger. In addition to the multiplayer spinoff, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg">a direct sequel is in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio has also partnered with Annapurna Pictures for future film and TV adaptations</a>.</p></div><div><p><em>Firebreak</em>’s release also comes during a very busy period for games, which will also include the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>), alongside games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">Doom: The Dark Ages</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655709/hori-usb-nintendo-switch-2-camera-gamechat-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After debuting a fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Piranha Plant-inspired alternative</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Nintendo’s own $50 Switch 2 camera</a>, Hori is back with another camera accessory for the console that’s less fun but more functional. Standing just shy of two inches tall and weighing 30 grams, the camera is small and light enough to be connected to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port without making the console feel top-heavy while playing in handheld mode.</p><p>Hori’s USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/NSX-023/dp/B0F5WTSW21">Amazon Japan website</a> for 3,981 yen, or around $28, making it much cheaper than the company’s $60 Piranha Plant cam. It’s not known if the tiny camera will be exclusive to Japan, but since the Piranha Plant is already listed on <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/nsx-001u/">Hori’s US website</a>, there’s a good chance this one will also see wider availability. For now, only Amazon Japan has the new camera listed with a June 5th, 2025 release date.</p><p>In addition to being small enough to perch atop the Switch 2, the GameChat-compatible camera can also be attached to an included weighted base allowing it to stand alone on an entertainment center like Nintendo’s own camera is designed to. The base also has a fold-down support on the underside so you can sit the camera on the top edge of a TV, assuming that edge is thin enough.</p><p>Hori’s latest camera seems like a better alternative to Nintendo’s in terms of portability, but like the Piranha Plant it’s limited to a resolution of only 640x480 – a significant step down from the 1080p capabilities of Nintendo’s. That’s potentially enough resolution to match the quality of Nintendo’s camera when Hori’s is perched atop the Switch 2 and right in front of your face. But when it’s zooming in on you from across the room while the camera is sitting next to your TV dock, there will likely be a significant reduction in video quality while using GameChat.</p><p>Nintendo says “any compatible USB-C camera you’d like” will work with the Switch 2 so you can probably use the external webcam you bought for work. But the company also warns that “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2Fcamera%2F" rel="sponsored">not all cameras may work as intended</a>” and it has included a testing tool in the Switch 2’s settings to make sure. If you’d rather play it safe and know ahead of time, both of Hori’s cameras are officially licensed Nintendo accessories.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
