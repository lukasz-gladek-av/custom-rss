            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Nintendo’s latest livestreamed event is highlighting the smattering of indie games coming to the Switch consoles later this year, and the Indie World Showcase is scheduled to start on Thursday, August 7th, at 9 AM ET.</p><p><em>Hades 2</em> might make an appearance, and there’s a slim chance the long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> might show up as well. It’s a 15-minute showcase, and while I’m not expecting any earth-shattering announcements, I am looking forward to seeing the games that’ll pad my Switch 2 library while I wait for news on the bigger titles like <em>Metroid Prime 4.</em></p><div><p>In its recent earnings report, Nintendo shared that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/718176/thats-a-lot-of-mario-karts">it sold nearly six million Switch 2 consoles</a> since the system’s launch in June, so there are a lot of people waiting for some new games to play, indie or otherwise. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">has also raised the price of the original Switch</a> in response to US tariff policy.</p></div><p>Even though there aren’t that many Switch 2 exclusives out there yet, Nintendo, through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718847/whats-better-than-one-nintendo-direct-two">back-to-back</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">directs</a>, is working to ensure people know what other games will be available to play. This event is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw?si=CRv9AcQV-tALADGL">streaming live on YouTube</a>, and you can read on below for all of the updates as they’re announced.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>What’s better than one Nintendo Direct? Two.</p><p>Nintendo has some more games to show us. After the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">Partner Direct showcase last week</a>, Nintendo has announced yet another showcase, this time an Indie World presentation, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTv0HmKoUqw">Thursday, August 7th, at 9AM ET on YouTube</a>. The presentation will be 15 minutes long which is plenty of time to share at least one new trailer for <em>Silksong</em>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzE3MTYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">Nintendo’s Switch 2 doubles first-month sales of the original</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo’s financial year is off to a bumper start thanks to explosive sales of its Switch 2 console. Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo’s Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>“Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,” Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I see a new Hades II update.</p></div></li></ul></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/719807/nintendo-switch-2-indie-world-direct-showcase-livestream]]></content:encoded>
