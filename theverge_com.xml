            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An hour-long video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0">published Saturday</a> by Gamers Nexus, a YouTube channel focused on PC gaming hardware, accuses NZXT’s PC rental program of “bait-and-switch” tactics, with prices and specs that are constantly changing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211490/nzxt-flex-desktop-gaming-pc-rental-service-subscription-nvidia-gpu-games">Flex program</a> allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 per month (not including a mouse, keyboard, or monitor). But Gamers Nexus shows that NZXT changes the specs and prices of PC models “day-to-day in some instances” and offers PCs with very different setups under similar model names depending on whether you are looking to buy or rent. The rapidly changing prices also obscure the potential value of listed “discounts” as the packages shift back and forth.</p><p>The video shows one instance of <a href="https://nzxt.com/product/player-three">NZXT’s Player: Three PC</a> listed as having an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics card, along with an Intel Core i7-13700KF with the “buy” option selected. However, viewing the same PC model under the “subscribe” option showed the same processor with a less powerful Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti. </p><p>Despite the different GPUs, it said NZXT listed both models as having the same estimated frames per second in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare</em>.</p><p>Gamers Nexus also highlights other elements of the Flex program, like the pricing scheme that leads customers to pay more money than simply buying a PC outright and “aggressive” terms of service. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to NZXT with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back, and we haven’t seen a response posted in its community areas or social media channels.</p><p>“We just think this is a scam at this point,” Steve Burke, the editor-in-chief at Gamers Nexus, says during the video. “The performance claims alone are hugely misleading, especially since the only difference in one of these that’s meaningful is the word ‘Super,’ which a lot of people — especially those who are potentially renting or buying a pre-built — won’t catch.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310104/intel-arc-b570-battlemage-gpu-leaked-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is expected to release a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309086/intel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">entry-level Battlemage GPUs this week</a>, and now marketing materials posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu?ref_src=embed">by reliable leaker Roland Quandt</a> show what we might see from the lower-specced Arc B570. The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
