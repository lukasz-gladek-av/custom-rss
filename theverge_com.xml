            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, alleging that the company has “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana.”</p><p>Roblox sees more than 111.8 million daily active users, and it’s hugely popular with children, with users under 13 comprising nearly 40 percent of players last quarter. However, the platform has come under significant scrutiny over reported failures to protect children on the platform, with <em>Bloomberg</em> publishing a major report last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">about predators on Roblox</a> and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleging that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">its research revealed</a> “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” In recent months, Roblox has taken steps to bolster its child safety features, including introducing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">parent accounts</a> that can manage their child’s account and the ability for parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">to block people on their child’s friend list</a>.</p><p>But Louisiana alleges that Roblox’s “deliberate failure to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from well-documented predatory threats, along with its ongoing failure to warn parents and children of the foreseeable dangers posed by its platform, has directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana,” according to the complaint.</p><p>“Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322">Attorney General Liz Murrill says</a>. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”</p><p>Roblox spokesperson Kadia Koroma sent the following statement about the lawsuit to <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>The assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is categorically untrue. Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn stem skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. We dedicate vast resources to supporting a safe infrastructure including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior — not only because it’s important to us but because it is such a critical issue and so important to our community. We dispute these allegations and we remain committed to working with Attorney General Murrill to keep kids safe.</p><p>While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards—such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing—to help protect our community. Unfortunately, bad actors will try to circumvent our systems to try to direct users off the platform, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>The company also published an <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">article responding to the lawsuit</a> on its newsroom.</p></div><p>Seven lawsuits regarding child predator issues have been filed against Roblox in a “little over two weeks,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-15/roblox-shares-fall-after-louisiana-attorney-general-files-suit?srnd=homepage-americas"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>.</p><p>This week, Roblox published <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">a post on its website</a> about why it removes what it describes as “vigilantes” who try to catch bad actors on Roblox by using tactics “similar to actual predators.” One user, who goes by “Schlep” and says on <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep">his X profile</a> that he has contributed to “6 Roblox arrests and counting,” posted screenshots <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep/status/1954255952997478537">on X</a> last week of what he says was a cease-and-desist notice by Roblox.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 15th</strong>: Added statement from Roblox.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[What my first five Steam purchases say about me]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/760049/steam-first-five-purchases-meme-dragon-age</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-my-first-five-steam-purchases-say-about-me.1271403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a meme currently going around Bluesky where people are posting their first purchases on Steam. Taking a look presents a neat time capsule, offering a glimpse of who we used to be. It also gives us a chance to compare our gaming habits now with what they were 10 or more years ago — that is, if you’re one of the Olds that’s been around that long. On a lark, I looked at mine and got the thrill of being able to place a date on when exactly my current life began.</p><p>Sometimes, examining your earliest Steam purchases presents as many questions as answers. My very first Steam purchases were made on December 25th, 2010, and were all over the place in genre: <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, the <em>Left 4 Dead </em>bundle, and<em> Team Fortress 2</em>. I played and enjoyed many hours of both <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and <em>Amnesia</em>, but to this very day, I have never stepped foot inside a <em>TF2</em> lobby.</p><p><em>TF2</em> was not my kind of game. Hero shooters wouldn’t be a Thing for me until <em>Overwatch</em> blew down the doors of my anti-multiplayer shooter bunker and even then, it’s only <em>Overwatch</em>. Not to mention that the stories of <em>TF2</em> voice chat toxicity were the stuff of 4chan legend. My Black, female ass in a voice chat multiplayer lobby in <em>2010</em>? Absolutely not!</p><p>This list has kickstarted memories that I haven’t reached for in decades, but I don’t think I’ll ever understand why I bought <em>TF2</em>.</p><p>My next set of purchases came a few months later in January and February 2011: <em>DC Universe Online</em> and <em>Rift</em>. Why I bought these MMOs makes far more sense to me than my forever mysterious purchase of <em>TF2</em>. Before getting my Steam account, the only computer games I had ever played were MMOs and the<em> Rise of Rome </em>expansion from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578144/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-xbox-controller"><em>Age of Empires II</em></a><em>. </em>(If you want to know how the Roman Empire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/09/21/tiktoks-roman-empire-meme-explained/">became my Roman Empire</a>, look no further.)</p><p>I was a big <em>World of Warcraft</em> player, but by that time, I had grown bored with it. 2011 would have been right between the <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansions, neither of which I particularly liked. I didn’t really jive with <em>DC Universe Online</em> either, but I played it because, of all things, a boy. My boyfriend at the time was super into the MMO, in which you cosplay as heroes who take over when Wonder Woman and Batman are indisposed. Both my subscription and the relationship lasted longer than they should have.</p><p>I remember the buzz surrounding <em>Rift</em>, a new-at-the-time MMO that was supposed to be the “<em>WoW</em> killer” — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft/483876/the-wow-killers-that-werent/">unaware that such claims had been made about many other MMOs at the time</a>. I remember very little about <em>Rift</em>, which is probably why my <em>WoW</em> subscription is more than 20 years old at this point.</p><p>The fact that <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is on this list at all is another mystery. Before it, I had never played any BioWare games nor any narrative PC games. I don’t remember who suggested it to me — maybe my boyfriend, maybe a friend at college. But the presence of this game on this list gives me an exact date for when my life changed as a gamer and a person: Saturday, March 19, 2011.</p><p><em>Origins</em> isn’t my favorite in the series. In fact, it’s the one <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-returning-to-dragon-1844909473">I dread the most trying to replay</a>. (I am mad as <em>hell</em> at the revelation from <em>Dragon Age</em> producer Mark Darrah that EA <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ea-reportedly-turned-down-pitch-for-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-tragic/">refused to fund a remaster of the series</a>.) But it’s the one that introduced me to narrative, choice-focused, and companion-romancing RPGs. It introduced me to my first BioWare romance Alistair Theirin, and as in all things regarding love, you never forget your first.</p><p>Knowing when I bought this game puts me back in a place that I haven’t thought of in literal decades. I played<em> Origins</em> on a tiny desktop computer tucked into the corner of my too-small living room. That was my first apartment with my boyfriend, and I felt grown for the first time, even though I was well into my early 20s. But even though I was cohabitating with a real man, I was obsessed with the pixelated one in my computer. So obsessed that I taught myself to mod just to add more, shall we say, “<em>narrative</em>” scenes between my Warden character and Alistair. There’s even a funny bit of environmental storytelling with this list. After <em>Origins</em>, I didn’t make another Steam purchase for more than a year. The game took over my life.</p><p>The rest is history. My introduction to the <em>Dragon Age</em> series brought me into the <em>Dragon Age</em> fandom. Through it, I would meet my best and longest friends, rediscover my love of writing, and with that instigating spark, start the journey that would lead me to becoming a game journalist — the second-best decision I’ve made in my life. (The first being finally letting go of that previous relationship.)</p><p>I really appreciate that Steam has kept such a thorough accounting of my early activities on the platform because it’s put a date on the origin of the person that I am today. Go look at yours and see how much you’ve changed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760049/steam-first-five-purchases-meme-dragon-age]]></content:encoded>
