            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/687759/nexus-mods-pc-new-owner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nexus Mods, a website known for hosting mods for thousands of PC games, has been handed over to new ownership, according to former owner Robin “Dark0ne” Scott.</p><p>“After months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task,” Scott says in a post <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed">published on Monday</a>.</p><p>Scott, who launched the project in 2001, says that the site “has been my entire adult life” and that “the strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created” had taken a toll. He realized he had been burning out and that he needed to bring in new leadership.</p><p>Scott didn’t specify who the new owner or owners are, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent to its support email address. However, users will be seeing more of two people, who Scott identifies as “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> (Victor)” and “<a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a> (Marinus),” as they have “come on board to lead this next chapter,” Scott says. “They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p><p>While the site has changed hands, Scott says that “this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal.” Instead, “this is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><p>Scott will also still be a presence. “I’ll still be annoying people on the Mod Author Discord, lurking on the forums, and sticking my nose into community matters when I can’t help myself,” he says. And he’ll work with the team to “help guide the overall direction of the site.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
