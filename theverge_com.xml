            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/678265/wholesome-direct-2025-best-games-play-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Wholesome Direct is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171620/wholesome-direct-2024-sgf-trailers-news">always full of cute and charming games to keep an eye on for the future</a>. But it’s also a great place to find things to play now — and that’s especially true this year. The 2025 edition of the livestream showcase included a number of games that released during the show itself.</p><p>So if you like what you see, there’s no wait at all.</p><p>Finally, a game that combines designing your own house with going on a road trip. <em>Camper Van: Make it Home</em> is exactly what it sounds like. On the design side, you’re able to customize a tiny home camper and make it appropriately cozy, but the developers say it will also take you on “a journey of self-discovery.”</p><div><p id="fireside-feelings"><h2><em>Fireside Feelings</em></h2></p></div><p>This game seems designed entirely around comfort. You play as a cute little animal and spend your time curled up around a fire, chatting with friends, and guiding the conversation as you get pulled into a bigger story.</p><p>Puzzle game meets scrapbooking. Here the goal is to organize a huge cache of family photos, and as you do, discover their history and story. “Inspired by the way elders pass down family history using pictures to support their storytelling,” the developers explain, “this game blends narrative, puzzle, and creativity.”</p><p>This game is almost worth checking out for the pun title alone. In it, you create all kinds of weird omelets on a conveyor belt to deliver to students with seemingly very weird taste buds. Also, the principal is a rooster.</p><p>From the same team behind the similarly gothic <em>A Mortician’s Tale</em>, this game has players exploring a chill cemetery that changes based on the time of day and season. It even has sound effects recorded from an IRL cemetery. And not only is out today, it’s a completely free download.</p><p>For those who wish Picross also had lots of adorable little mice. In addition to all of the number-based puzzle solving, <em>Squeakross</em> also has some collecting elements, where you can gather decorations and stickers to up the cozy factor.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Inlusio Interactive</cite></p></div><p>This hand-drawn adventure game looks absolutely stunning, like an animated movie come to life, and it stars a little guy who can change shape to explore the natural world in various contexts. While the whole experience isn’t available yet, you can play the game’s first episode now.</p><p>This game may give you a craving for Boss Coffee, but it also looks pretty laid-back. It’s described as a “charming idle simulation game,” and the goal is to build an empire of vending machines, where you’ll have to manage staff and handle decorations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
