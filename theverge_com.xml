            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is releasing a new GeForce Game Ready Driver today that expands support for Windows 10 devices, alongside some games and G-Sync displays. Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support will now be available for GeForce RTX GPUs until October 2026, a year beyond when Microsoft is planning to stop supporting the operating system <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533018/microsoft-windows-10-end-support-date">on October 14th, 2025</a>.</p><p>The expanded support from Nvidia will ensure that users will continue receiving the latest zero-day optimisations for new games and apps, giving them some wriggle room before updating to a new OS. Windows 10 is still a hugely popular OS in spite of now<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715039/microsoft-windows-10-birthday-10-years-old"> being a decade old</a>, and Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336586/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh-ces-2025">struggled to shift consumers</a> to Windows 11 ahead of its predecessor’s retirement date. The number of Windows 11 users only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699161/microsoft-windows-11-usage-milestone-windows-10">surpassed Windows 10 earlier this month</a>, now holding 52 percent of the Windows market, compared to 44.59 percent for Windows 10.</p><p>Older Nvidia GPUs are getting a lifeline, too. After a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, Nvidia says that Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta-based GeForce cards will receive quarterly security updates until October 2028, bringing lifetime support up to 11 years. It’s worth noting, however, that support updates for Nvidia’s CUDA architecture will be dropped for these cards in the next CUDA Toolkit update.</p><p>The latest Game Ready driver update will also expand support to include 62 new monitor displays that are compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync variable refresh rate tech, and improves performance in <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> when the latter is released on August 8th.
