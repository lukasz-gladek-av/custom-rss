            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Bethesda is making <em>The</em> <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> official just days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">the game leaked</a>. <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> is a remaster of the nearly 20-year-old game, developed by Virtuous. <em><a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en-US/oblivion-remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a></em> is shadow dropping today, and it’s available on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2623190%2FThe_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP1003-PPSA21203_00-ALTARDELUXEED000/">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered%2F9NQR437K7PQH%2F0010" rel="sponsored">Xbox Series X / S</a> right now for $49.99, or as part of Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>“<em>Oblivion </em>was a real defining moment in the series and for how we make games as a studio,” says Todd Howard, studio head of Bethesda. The remastered version of <em>Oblivion</em> has overhauled graphics for modern hardware, and includes the <em>Knights of the Nine</em> and <em>Shivering Isles</em> expansions.</p><p>While the naming suggests this is a remaster of the original game, developer Virtuous has actually fully remade the title in Unreal Engine 5. Virtuous has produced several comparisons between the game’s original 2006 release to <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, and the differences are huge. Every single asset in the game was remade and created from scratch, and the game has a lot more realistic shadows.</p><p>There’s even a big improvement to the lip sync parts of the game, thanks to the latest technologies in Unreal Engine 5. Gameplay has also been modernized, with audio, UI, and leveling systems all updated. The new leveling system is “the best of both worlds” of <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Oblivion</em>, and there have also been modifications to encumbrance, non-combat perks, and other mechanics.</p><p>Bethesda and Virtuous have even modernized and updated the third-person view in <em>Oblivion </em>and added sprinting to the game. There are improved UI for systems like Persuasion and Clairvoyance, as well as HUD, menu, and map reworks and improved enemy scaling. All characters have updated animations as a result of these big changes.</p><p>“We’ve modernized a lot, but it’s still the same incredible adventure and the same carefully crafted world,” says Tom Mustaine, Bethesda’s external projects and studio director, during a reveal stream.</p><p>Bethesda is also releasing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Deluxe Edition</em>, which includes bonus quests, unique armor, weapon, and horse armor sets, a digital artbook, and the official soundtrack.</p><p>Rumors of an <em>Oblivion </em>remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">originally appeared in 2023</a>, thanks to documents in the FTC’s case against Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition. An unannounced <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster and another game in the <em>Dishonored</em> franchise were also part of Microsoft’s documents.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
