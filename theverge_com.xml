            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Ghost</em> games aim to make you feel like you’re playing a classic samurai movie. To make the connection more obvious, <em><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></em> added a black-and-white mode made in collaboration with the estate of <em>Seven Samurai</em> director Akira Kurosawa. The sequel <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> builds on that by bringing back the Kurosawa mode and adding two more “cinematic modes” made in collaboration with famous filmmakers: one inspired by <em>13 Assassins</em> director Takashi Miike with a tighter camera during fights, and one inspired by <em>Samurai Champloo</em> director Shinichirō Watanabe that adds lo-fi beats.</p><p>With <em>Yōtei</em>, “we’re standing on the shoulders of a previously made game,” Jason Connell, co-creative director at developer Sucker Punch, tells <em>The Verge</em>. This time, the “quest” was to celebrate two other artists.</p><p>Kurosawa mode is the most striking mode. In addition to switching <em>Yōtei</em>’s colorful, saturated aesthetic into black and white, the audio is a bit more muffled, like it is in classic films — voices in particular sound tinny, which I think is a cool old-school touch — and there’s additional wind to add more motion to what you see on screen. “As soon as you take color out of the picture, it really changes your perspective and what you’re looking at,” Connell says, adding that depth has “different meaning” in black and white.</p><p>Miike mode is more subtle: during fights, the camera is much closer to <em>Yōtei</em>’s protagonist, Atsu, and you’ll see more blood and mud. The development team has “always wanted” a camera mode that is more pushed in so that “you can get a more visceral experience,” Connell says, and paying homage to Takashi Miike gave them a way to do it. The mode means that fights can be more difficult; <em>Yōtei</em> usually has a zoomed-back camera during battles that gives you a wide view of your opponents. But it also makes the already aggressive and violent fights feel more intense.</p><p>Watanabe mode, on the other hand, is much more chill, switching out the game’s usual soundtrack for a selection of lo-fi songs created under the direction of Watanabe that you’ll hear during exploration and some fights. I’ve loved turning on Watanabe mode when I don’t have a specific goal in mind, as the lo-fi music helps me settle into wandering instead of being laser-focused on the next objective. (You won’t hear the Watanabe beats in story missions because the game has specific orchestrations set up for those events, Connell says.)</p><p>Connell says that <em>Tsushima</em> players were already punching into the action in their photo mode shots or playing the game with lo-fi music. To me, they’re good for specific moments, but it’s often weird to play the game with them on for extended sessions. For example, Kurosawa mode makes many of the story cutscenes feel much more cinematic, but during an elaborate infiltration mission, the black-and-white visuals made seeing enemies and finding places to hide particularly tricky, so I turned it off.</p><p>Connell acknowledges that sometimes the modes and what you’re doing in the game can be anachronistic. But he says that since players have to opt in to the modes, “we feel it’s an okay area for people to customize the game to their own liking.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789026/ghost-of-yotei-cinematic-modes-kurosawa-miike-watanabe]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has brought two of the very best <em>Super Mario</em> games to the Switch and Switch 2. It’s no surprise that <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> and its sequel are excellent; these are critically acclaimed games, and two of the best-selling titles for the Wii, Nintendo’s top-selling console prior to the Switch era. So it’s great to have a pair of the most inventive platformers ever made easily accessible in 2025. At the same time, these releases are disappointing in just how simple they are. Nintendo has an enviable amount of history and talent, and re-releases like this would be the ideal place to share that with the world. Alas, we get straightforward ports instead.</p><p>The <em>Galaxy</em> games, which originally debuted in 2007 and 2010, represent a sort of evolutionary offshoot of the 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming line. The sci-fi premise — which, among other things, introduced Rosalina to the world — involves Mario traveling to small planets, many of which are bite-sized spheres that fit on a single screen. The goal, as always, is to collect shiny stars to open up more levels to explore. But what makes <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel unique is how tightly-focused every level is. Each usually has a single idea that it explores <em>just</em> long enough before moving on to the next thing.</p><p>That design-first focus means that these games have aged remarkably well. It feels weird at first to not have complete control over the camera, but I adjusted pretty quickly, helped along by the fact that the levels are almost all small and designed around those camera limitations. Like the best <em>Super Mario</em> games, these are an explosion of ideas; one second you’re fighting against gravity while side-scrolling inside of a giant pill, the next you’re using Yoshi’s tongue to flip across perilous gaps. Given the way the <em>Super Mario</em> series has evolved, going in very different directions with releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">the more open-ended <em>Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">the silly side-scrolling of <em>Wonder</em></a><em>,</em> there remains nothing like <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel.</p><p>I also love that playing with detached Joy-Con controllers is a pretty solid approximation of using an old Wii remote and nunchuk, a control scheme the original games were built around. (You’ll be doing a lot of pointing at the screen here.) Both <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel also still look great; the mix of classic, cartoony Mario style and glittery sci-fi locales work really well together.</p><p>Which is probably why Nintendo hasn’t done much for these ports — they don’t need a lot of work to begin with. The resolution is a little better, there are touchscreen controls for when you’re playing in portable mode, the storybook elements have been expanded somewhat, and there’s a very welcome new “assist” mode that makes things a little easier. Even still, considering these releases cost $40 each (or $70 as a physical bundle) the lack of frills is disappointing.</p><p>This is pretty much par for the course for Nintendo. The most recent re-release of the first <em>Galaxy</em> came in the form of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em></a>, a similarly barebones collection on the original Switch that was inexplicably only available for a limited time. So I’m conflicted here. Yes, this is a chance for a whole new audience to play two incredible games. But would it have killed Nintendo to show these games just a little more love? To treat them like more than promotional fodder for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">the next <em>Super Mario</em> movie</a>?</p><p>Maybe I’m spoiled by the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">Digital Eclipse</a> and the Criterion Collection, but it’s clear that Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">a company that has its own museum, for crying out loud</a> — could do a lot more to celebrate its most innovative and successful games. It’s a company with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16577860/super-mario-odyssey-travel-interview-kenta-motokura">creative</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">talent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki">that</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview">sticks</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">around</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18759918/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-takashi-tezuka-interview">for decades</a>, each of whom is full of insights into how these games get made. With all of the inventiveness on display in <em>Galaxy</em>, it’s prime material for such a celebration.</p><p>It doesn’t seem like that will happen any time soon, though. So in the meantime I’ll just repeat the obvious: <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> still rules.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
