EA will be releasing a free, standalone version of the character creator for all platforms the game is available on (PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC), and you’ll be able to bring the character you make in the free creator over to the full game if you decide to buy it.</p><p>If you have any interest at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, I really recommend checking out the free character creator when it’s available and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">seeing all of the options</a>. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware">Hair looks particularly good</a>.) And if you end up making a character, transfer them to the game, and want to make some tweaks, you’ll be able to do so early on in your adventure, so don’t sweat your decisions too much.</p><p>EA is also releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes">a fourth patch for the game</a>, which adds a mission that will reward you with in-game items themed around the <em>Dragon Age II</em> protagonist, Hawke. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
