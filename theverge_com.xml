According to the report, the developer is having discussions with <em>Fortnite, Roblox</em>, and <em>GTA</em> creators about making “custom experiences” inside what’s shaping up to be the biggest gaming release since the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game launched way (<em>way</em>) back in 2013.</p><p>That Rockstar has made user-generated content part of its strategy for <em>GTA VI</em> should come as no surprise. Despite the last <em>GTA</em> launching over ten years ago (same with <em>GTA Online</em>), interest in the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880410/twitch-gta-nopixel-role-play-best-grand-theft-auto-v">has stayed fresh with the help of mods</a> like FiveM that allow users to host and join their own multiplayer servers. </p><p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">initially banned some of the creators of FiveM</a> back in 2015, citing that their mod was “an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.” However, as the popularity of the kinds of games and role-playing enabled by FiveM and similar mods grew, Rockstar reversed course. In 2023, the company acquired Cfx.re, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the team that developed FiveM</a>.</p><p>Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em> remain at the top of US sales charts years after their release thanks to the popularity of user-generated content. Arranging deals with creators prior to its launch will help <em>GTA VI</em> hit the ground running in a crowded marketplace.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
