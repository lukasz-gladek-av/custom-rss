            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bengaluru, India-based developer <a title="Companies > Aeos Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/aeos-games">Aeos Games</a> have released a 12-minute early alpha gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Unleash the Avatar" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/unleash-the-avatar">Unleash the Avatar</a></em>, showcasing the Soulslike <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a>‘s combat systems, enemies, traversal, exploration, and more. <span id="more-999560"></span></p><p>“We’re big fans of Soulslikes thanks to their challenging combat and story-telling,” says Aeos Games CEO and co-founder Rohan Mayya in a press release. “And while it could be easy enough to reskin existing efforts and call it a day, our team has painstakingly built up everything from first principles. From our in-house, best-in-class photogrammetry to full-body mo-cap and even our bespoke enemy AI systems, every single bit of Unleash the Avatar has been lovingly hand-crafted.”</p><p>Mayya added, “Every wishlist counts because not only does it build our confidence that we’re making something you care about, but it signals to the world that Indian games have an audience. So if the trailer resonates with you and if you believe in a bold spin on the Soulslike genre from a scrappy team, please hit that wishlist button now.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Latest Informaton</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Independent game developer Aeos Games revealed a substantial amount of gameplay for its upcoming Indian Epics-inspired Soulslike, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. The events of the game are set in an alternate version of India where the player is up against the wayward forces of Naraka (hell) who manage to unseal the barrier between realms. Along with challenging enemy encounters and memorable boss fights, players will also uncover the events that led to hell on earth and fight back the darkness for good.</p><p>The trailer shows off the haunting vistas of Vishwapur. This once pristine coastal locale is now overrun by Nisthari Rakshas. Players are tasked with defeating them with an assortment of combat options at their disposal ranging from genre staples like dodge, parry, and stagger attacks along with some new innovations like a ranged chakra and a flashy feather prism form.</p><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p>First up, we’d like to thank each and every one of you for your support for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. It’s heartening to see so many people care. Our team is heads down and working to get the game out so that we can live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, before we start getting into how exactly <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is built in terms of tech, art, world, and story, here’s all the basic information about the game in one place. This should clear doubts you have about <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and what to expect.</p><p><strong>Who is Aeos Games?</strong></p><p>Aeos Games is the game development studio behind <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and is a part of the Aeos group of companies. Founders are brothers Varun and Rohan Mayya. The core development team is a mix of newcomers and industry veterans that have worked on games such as <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and movies like <em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;and <em>Flash</em>.</p><p><strong>What is Unleash the Avatar?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is an Indian Epic Soulslike set in an alternate timeline featuring flashy, intense combat against legendary foes.</p><p><strong>What’s <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story about? What’s my character called?</strong></p><p>While it’s a little too early for us to reveal all of <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story, what we can say is, the game takes place in an age where the barrier between Naraka (Hell) and Earth has eroded and both Asuras and Rakshasas—have found their way to Earth. Imbued with a sliver of Lord Vishnu’s power, it is up to you to restore balance to the universe by putting an end to the demons’ sinister plans.</p><p><strong>Why is there an alternate India setting in this trailer that’s more inline with high fantasy instead of the relatively modern setting of the first trailer?</strong></p><p>The first trailer was meant to be a test of our photogrammetry systems and a public showing of our intent to work on a title from India.</p><p>Following feedback from our fans we felt the alternate high fantasy, Indian Epics-inspired setting you see now is more in line with the story we want to tell—and what our fans want to see—from a game like ours.</p><p><strong>What can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on? Can I wishlist it now?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,525 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch. Stay tuned to our Steam page reveal and wishlist us to support what we do.</p><p><strong>Do I have to pay to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is a premium, one-time purchase. No battle passes. No loot boxes. No daily grind. No dark patterns.</p><p><strong>When will I be able to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>Remember that this is our first production title so we may not be super accurate with our launch dates as it is hard to tell right now. Internally however, we’re on course for a 2026 launch window. We’re currently in the production phase so we do have playtests every now and then. If you would like to be a part of these, keep an eye on our socials for playtest announcement dates.</p><p><strong>Can I make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>? Will you copyright strike my channel? Is there an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program?</strong></p><p>Yes you can make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and no we won’t copyright strike your channel. There are exceptions to this such as using <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> art, screenshots, videos, and gameplay to misrepresent the game or being in violation of our content creator guidelines. And yes, there is an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program. Stay tuned to our socials to know more.</p><p><strong>Is <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for PC via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.</p><p><strong>Can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on the Steam Deck / ROG Ally / Xbox ROG Ally X / Lenovo Legion Go 2?</strong></p><p>We’re big fans of handheld PCs and we’d love to bring <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> to Steam Deck and other devices as well. Right now though, our focus is solely on desktops and laptop-grade computers.</p><p><strong>Is AI used in making <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>If you’re referring to enemy AI systems that are a cornerstone of every soulslike, yes those exist. If you’re asking if we’re using generative AI tools to make Unleash the Avatar, the answer is no. The game is handcrafted with love by fans of the genre, using gen AI would be a disservice to soulslikes and their fans.</p><p><strong>Is there anything new that we get to see in <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> that isn’t in other games?</strong></p><p>Built from first principles, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> runs on several custom systems: a fragmented-chakra engine with its own physics, enemy AI that knows when to reset posture, when to press, and how hard to push (tuned centrally), and a rigorously engineered parry model. Add generous chances to aura farm, and you get a soulslike that feels familiar, yet unmistakably new. We’ve also manually scanned countless photogrammetry assets from old towns in India specifically for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>, so enjoy an authentic reconstruction of India in a video game!</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/indian-epics-inspired-soulslike-action-rpg-unleash-the-avatar-early-alpha-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
