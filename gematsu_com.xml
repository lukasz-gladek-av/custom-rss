    <p><span>Cyrene joins the fray in the Amphoreous saga's grand finale.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “As Tomorrow Became Yesterday,” will launch on November 5, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1002255"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga. As Trailblazers brace for their final challenge, Cyrene joins the ranks as a new playable character. Alongside her debut, powerful enemies and exciting limited-time events await, inviting players to embark on the adventure across a world brimming with danger and rewards.</p><p>Over the course of the Amphoreous saga, the Astral Express trio inherited the Titan Coreflames, gaining newfound strength and becoming inextricably bound to Amphoreous’s destiny. Now, the Astral Express crew stands shoulder to shoulder with the Chrysos Heirs, confronting “Irontomb”—the most formidable foe to time itself, in a battle whose weight surpasses anything Amphoreous has ever faced. Yet the conflict extends beyond the paths of Destruction and Erudition, as the forces of Remembrance stir in the dark. With the cosmos on the brink, no great power can afford to remain silent. Through the resolve of the Trailblazers and the wisdom of the geniuses, a Cosmic Alliance begins to rise. </p><p>The final battlefield lies within the “Ruins of Time”, a barren realm where gravel drifts through the air and the horizon fades into an endless wilderness. When Irontomb’s power once stirred prematurely, Phainon poured all his strength into sealing it away—the Trailblazer can see a giant sword piercing into the earth’s core, and a statue that resembles Phainon. He left behind three layers of seals, waiting for the day his companions would return to break them, and together, bring Irontomb to its end.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002323"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the final battle unfolds, Cyrene joins the roster of playable characters. From the very beginning of the Amphoreous journey, she has accompanied the Trailblazers in many different forms. In Version 3.7, Cyrene will finally open up to the Trailblazer she trusts the most, revealing her long-hidden past and the answers behind her mysteries. Cyrene is a 5-star Ice-Type character on the Path of the Remembrance. When she is on the team, the DMG dealt by all allies is increased. Cyrene’s Skill deploys a Zone. While it is active, any damage dealt by an ally to an enemy will trigger an additional instance of True DMG. Meanwhile, every action a teammate takes stacks “Recollection” for Cyrene. When “Recollection” is fully stacked, Cyrene can activate her Ultimate, reaching her most powerful state. When Cyrene uses her Ultimate for the first time, it will instantly activate the Ultimates of all teammates and make her Zone permanent. At this point, she also summons Cyrene in her memosprite form. This “memosprite Cyrene” can choose to enhance any teammate, and if the target is a Chrysos Heir character, they will be granted an exclusive special effect. Furthermore, when memosprite Cyrene takes action, it can either buff teammates or deal damage to all enemies, helping lead the team to victory.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the new version, a large-scale permanent gameplay mode, “Currency Wars,” will make its debut. Trailblazers can form teams of up to ten characters, divided into “on-field” and “off-field” areas that work together in combat. When characters of the same combat type or belonging to the same faction fight side by side, they will trigger special “Bond” effects, unleashing greater power as a team. At launch, “Currency Wars” will feature 61 participating characters, all of whom will be available for free trial. As a major permanent mode, in addition to challenge rewards, it also features a periodic reward system similar to “Divergent Universe,” and will introduce new challenges and growth experiences through updates.</p><p>There’s still plenty for Trailblazers to look forward to in this update. The new event, “Snack Dash,” is on its way, inviting Trailblazers to take part in a lighthearted competition full of creativity and fun. Madam Ruan Mei’s delightful creations will race across obstacle-filled tracks, striving for the finish line and higher rankings. Version 3.7 will also implement the “Trailblaze Fashion” system, giving players more fun cosmetic customization options, including the limited headwear “Deliverer’s Wreath” available for free after completing the version’s Main Missions. Finally, a new animated short, “Hello, World,” and the song  “Ripples of Past Reverie, ” among other new content, will be released to accompany players as they reflect on the journey across the past seven versions and witness the perfect conclusion to the Amphoreus saga.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,637 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.
