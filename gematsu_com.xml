His luck changes when he discovers Rapidium, a resource that, when paired with the Quantum Computer, lets him create Alters—alternate versions of himself based on changing the pivotal decisions from his past.</p><p>The Alters aren’t just workers—they’re individuals with their own skills, emotions, and motivations. While essential for keeping the base functional, crafting tools, and mining resources, their distinct personalities can spark tension. Despite their differences, they share a common goal: survive, escape, and rely only on themselves.</p><p>The game explores the timeless question: “What if I had chosen differently?” This core theme fuels a deeply personal and thought-provoking narrative as players navigate Jan’s struggle for survival.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
