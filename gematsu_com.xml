From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to fight fiercely and make choices to restore peace, shape history to their own experience, battle enormous enemy armies, whilst navigating the chaos of the Three Kingdoms era.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history to date. Enemy soldiers attacking <a title="Genres > Co-Op [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly are a formidable threat, and players will not only fight with their own skills but also charge forward with their allies into massive enemy armies, allowing for a sense of realism on the battlefield of unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers will collide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The protagonist of this title takes to the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies with swords, fists and various other weapons. Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy as players dive into the most aggressive 1 vs. 1,000 combat in series history!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
