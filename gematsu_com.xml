By smartly combining the colors and patterns of the scraps, the player can not only score points for the completed design but also sew on buttons and attract adorable cats, who have their own preferences for bedding patterns.</p><p><strong>Stepping Beyond Adaptation</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Quilts &amp; Cats of Calico</em>, based on the board game <a title="Games > Calico [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/calico">Calico</a>, you will be immersed in a warm, cozy world full of cuddly cats. Here the quilt bends under the weight of their paws and loud purring can be heard. It’s a world full of patterns and designs awaiting the master quilt maker.</p><p>We also have a few surprises for the Calico fans like variations of the rules and mechanics in the campaign play. In addition to the well-known gameplay scenarios, new ones await to be discovered.</p><p><strong>Quilt Solo, With Friends, or With Strangers</strong></p><p>Whether you want to quilt solo or prefer to compete with other players, <em>Quilts &amp; Cats of Calico</em> will provide you with the corresponding gameplay mode. You will have cross-platform <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [438 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> at your disposal, during which you can invite friends or play ranked matches against random players.

Don’t worry, you won’t be alone – along the way, you’ll meet friends and, most importantly, cats whose help can prove invaluable…</p><p><strong>Spend Quality Time With Your Cats</strong></p><p>In Quilts &amp; Cats of Calico, cats are active during your games. Sometimes minding their own business, and other times coming to you and your quilt. They will lazily observe the board, romp and run around, and sometimes fall into a blissful nap. They are cats, you never know. You can interact with them during the game, pet them, and shoo them away when they get in the way.</p><p><strong>Extended Customization Options</strong></p><p>The game is full of cats, but there could always be more! In <em>Quilts &amp; Cats of Calico</em>, you can create your own, making your game even more wholesome! You can give it a name, choose the color of its fur, and put on different outfits. If you wish, it will appear on the board during your gameplay. It will also be possible to choose a different player’s portrait and background for the game. Pick what you like best!</p><p><strong>Beautiful, Relaxing Music</strong></p><p>We asked Pawel Gorniak, the composer responsible for the soundtrack to the digital version of <em><a title="Games > Wingspan [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/wingspan">Wingspan</a></em>, to create the music for <em>Quilts &amp; Cats of Calico</em>.

It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-941729"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Breakout Beyond</em> is a vibrant new reimagining of the <em>Breakout</em> series that invites players to break on through to the other side. This new entry into <em>Breakout</em> lore will challenge players not just to break every brick, but to creatively breach the wall with score-building combos. <em>Breakout Beyond</em> features a whole new sideways perspective, 72 levels for players to blast through, and two-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, designed to share the high-octane brick-breaking with a friend.</p><p>In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 <a title="Genres > Arcade [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a>, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>Featuring 72 challenging levels, players’ brick-blasting skills will be pushed to the brink—but they won’t need to face the challenge alone. Block-breakers can forgo going solo and team up with a friend for local two-player cooperative play and tackle the mayhem together. Alternatively, a new focus mode slows down time, sacrificing a higher score for greater control.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard.</li><li>72 challenging levels that will put players’ brick-breaking skills to the test.</li><li>Two-player cooperative play to manage (or ramp up) the chaos with a friend.</li><li>Procedural audio and visual effects that increase in intensity with each combo.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
