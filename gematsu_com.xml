A full release is planned across both console and PC. <span id="more-926304"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Various Aspects of Life!</strong></p><p><em>inZOI</em> is a life simulation game where the player can alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences. Just like in the real world, you can find jobs to make a living while forming deep relationships through interactions. With a complete community simulation of every character acting on their free will, you can experience unexpected events to feel the various emotions life has to offer. With <em>inZOI</em>, we hope to share the message that “life itself is the true gift, and every journey has its own meaning.”</p><p><strong>Live the Life of Your Dreams!</strong></p><p><em>inZOI</em> provides a variety of creative tools, so that players can visualize the life they’ve always dreamed of. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game’s realistic graphics allows the players to let their imagination run free, with easy creation of different resources. Customize your character’s appearance and outfit and build your custom home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures. You can also adjust different parts of your property and surrounding roads as well as aspects of your residing city for a fully customizable experience.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here is a message from producer and director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim posted to the game’s official Discord server today:</p><blockquote><p>To <em>inZOI</em> fans around the world,</p><p>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our fans. Your immense love and unwavering support mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom. Seeing everyone create such unique Zois during our <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> demo period was truly inspiring.</p><p>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing “Canvas” to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an incredible amount of uploads. Seeing such engagement brought us so much happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with <em>inZOI</em>. Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</p><p>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release <em>inZOI</em> in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving <em>inZOI</em> the best possible start.</p><p>It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with <em>inZOI</em>—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving <em>inZOI</em> a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible.</p><p>Until the release date, we’ll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come. We’ll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you’ll continue to join us on this journey towards <em>inZOI</em>‘s Early Access and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>With love,<br>Kjun</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/inZOI-EA_11-07-24_Art.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t worry though—the initial Early Access launch will only contain about a quarter of the main storyline. While we will be adding more areas and quests in several content updates leading up to the full release, we plan to bring in more side-quests and world-building content rather than progressing the main story too far. We will primarily focus on adding more classes, abilities, companions, and gameplay mechanics and working with the feedback we receive to make the underlying mechanics as balanced and fun to play as possible—so that when the full launch comes next year, everyone will have a reason to pick the game up again and make their mark on the New World.”</p><p>Information about the Early Access launch content will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Dreamate:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The New World looms on the horizon, on its shore the shining city of progress, and the last beacon of hope in your search for a cure to your family’s fatal disease—New Arc. You arrive to this foreign land by steerage of a steamship, cramped with thousands of other immigrants, a stranger in a strange land, full of wonder. But you will soon discover that the city’s beauty runs only skin-deep and all you find is rot beneath the golden facade.</p><p>Dark smoke from the factories chokes the skies, segregation, inequality, and corruption run rampant. You will have to rise from the very bottom, make tough decisions, and get your hands dirty if you are to succeed—and you must, no matter the cost!</p><p>Craft technopunk gear or master the arcane arts, fight, steal or smooth-talk your way to the top and become the hero or villain you want to be. You will not have to face the trials of this world alone, however; find your companions and gather your party, make foes and allies, fall in love, get involved in a massive conspiracy, and change the course of history forever.</p><p>Will you rise to the occasion?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become the Hero or the Villain You Want to Be</strong> – Create your own character as a Human, Elf, Dwarf or Giant, choose your gender, background and appearance.

Meet and recruit a diverse cast of characters, learn their stories, face their demons together and help them grow, or use them for your own gain and discard them as fits your schemes. Who knows, maybe you will even find your true love!</li><li><strong>Master Technology or Magic</strong> – Evolve your character as you see fit using a detailed progression system with 6 character classes and 12 subclasses. Will you master the secrets of Magic to incinerate enemies as a Hellfire occultist, curse them with mystical Voodoo abilities, or assist your allies as a Celestial sage? Or will you rather cast aside the obsolete ways and become a Steampunk mechanic, Dieselpunk engineer or Teslapunk scientist, and turn your character into a walking steam-powered fortress?</li><li><strong>Fight for Your Right</strong> – Command your party in turn-based tactical battles. Fight head-on and brute-force your way through encounters or observe and analyze each situation and come up with cunning strategies to conquer even seemingly overwhelming odds. There’s a plethora of skills, spells, <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> recipes and consumables at your disposal to turn the tide of battle in your favor.</li><li><strong>Manifest Your Destiny</strong> – Make a name for yourself, influence countless lives for better or worse, and watch the consequences of your choices unfold. You may start out as only a poor immigrant, but soon your exploits will fill the front pages of newspapers and the events you set in motion will change the fate of the New World forever.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
