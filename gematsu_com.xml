        <p>Take back the city of Tertium from hordes of bloodthirsty foes in this intense and brutal <a title="Genres > Action [2,289 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,922 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>. <em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em> is the new cooperative focused experience from the award-winning team behind the <em>Vermintide</em> series.</p><p>In the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos.</p><p>As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High Octane Hybrid Combat</strong> – Built on the legacy of <em>Warhammer 40,000: Vermintide II</em>‘s best-in-class melee combat, <em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em> introduces intense <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>&nbsp;gunplay to the mix. Master the balance between ranged and melee combat as you fight through a slew of enemies. Feel the impact of each swipe, swing, and slice of a chainsword, or fry some flesh with a lasgun.</li><li><strong>Die Alone or Suffer Together</strong> – Darktide is a <a title="Genres > Co-Op [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>. Wandering too far, risks punishment by foes looking to immobilize or capture stray Rejects, such as the slavering Chaos Hound or the Moebian Trapper. Once you fall prey to such foes, only your teammates can save you! More than that, your innate toughness—your determination to press on through the pain—only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team.</li><li><strong>Your Character. Your Playstyle</strong>&nbsp;– Create your own, unique character and customize their physical appearance, voice, and origin. Choose your class to determine which unique traits and skill sets they will make use of in battle. Will you be a seasoned veteran of the Imperial army, a snarky outsider, or a fiery zealot? The choice is yours.</li><li><strong>Tertium: A Hive City on the Brink of Collapse</strong> – Step into the violent, dystopian world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall—Tertium Hive is a hard and unforgiving place even at the best of times. Your role is to serve the zealous Inquisition by embarking on missions to exterminate the threats lurking in the depths of the hive city, or die trying.</li><li><strong>Chaos Never Sleeps</strong> – Adapt to the erratic whims of Chaos with conditions- mutators that add a spontaneous challenge to your mission. Your team must learn to adjust, adopt new tactics and change up their loadouts to face these ruthless challenges.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This has been a huge undertaking, and is one of most requested features.</p><p>Being able to jump seamlessly between platforms is really transformative. Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy <a title="Platforms > PC [21,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> rig, and view it in incredibly immersive <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,415 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> and PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,616 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a> and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,285 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, Steam Deck, <a title="Platforms > PS VR [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr">PlayStation VR</a> and <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, and PC VR.</p><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p><p>It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!</p><p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all <em>No Man’s Sky</em> players can connect their different platform accounts together <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></p><p><iframe title="No Man's Sky PlayStation 5 Pro Footage (8k)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ff9hZavmEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro releases today and is an incredible feat of engineering. We were so excited to get our hands on it from early days of development. We couldn’t wait to see what was possible in <em>No Man’s Sky</em> with so much power at our disposal!</p><p>We’re excited to be able to share an enhanced version of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> for PlayStation 5 Pro with players at launch. Bringing even more detail and higher image quality than ever possible on console before.</p><p><a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) allows for incredible upscaling to provide crisp 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> will also be an early supporter of 8K resolution, with the universe looking incredible in 8K at 30fps.</p><p>As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PlayStation 5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board. Players on PlayStation 5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has to offer, for the first time on console.</p><p>Not only this, but all of these improvements also come to PlayStation VR2! With our most stunning virtual reality imagery offering an even more immersive experience for Travellers amongst the stars.</p><p>The small team at Hello Games like nothing more than to play around with new technology. From supporting our players on first generation hardware, right back to Switch and PlayStation 4, to the highest end PCs, next generation consoles, and now support for cutting edge PlayStation 5 Pro is available at launch as another free update.</p><p><strong>The Normandy Returns</strong></p><p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Mass Effect Normandy Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9tWSdd1hD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Everyone here at Hello Games is a huge sci-fi nerd. One of our absolute favorite series is the incredible <em>Mass Effect</em> games. To join in <em>Mass Effect</em>‘s annual N7 celebrations, we are pleased to welcome the legendary SSV Normandy SR1 back into <em>No Man’s Sky</em>!</p><p>It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran. The limited-time expedition starts today, runs for two weeks and culminates in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet.</p><p>In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection.</p><p><em>Mass Effect</em> fans know that this legendary frigate only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p><p>Huge thanks to our friends at <a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,756 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a title="Companies > BioWare [369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/bioware">BioWare</a> for helping make this happen.</p><p>It has been a momentous year for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> in a number of ways. We’re so grateful to be able to continue this journey with you.</p><p><strong>5.25 Patch Notes</strong></p><ul><li>Cross-Save is now enabled for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, allowing players to transfer save games between all platforms.
