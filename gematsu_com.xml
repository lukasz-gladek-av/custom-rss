            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Zero Hour</em> developer <a title="Companies > AttritoM7 Productions" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/attritom7-productions">AttritoM7 Productions</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > BLACKWOOD" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/blackwood">BLACKWOOD</a></em>, a third-person <a title="Genres > Action [3,109 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> thriller set in 2012 New York, coming to <a title="Platforms > PC [24,464 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639070/BLACKWOOD/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q3 2026. <span id="more-998361"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via AttritoM7 Productions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Step into the world of <em>BLACKWOOD</em>, a gritty third-person action thriller that blends smooth, responsive combat with cinematic storytelling.</p><p>By day, Anton Blackwood runs a small DVD store in Brooklyn, a place of quiet routines and fleeting moments of normalcy. Among the customers and shelves of old films, there is someone who sees a side of Anton that few others do: a woman who works in the store and notices the gentler side of him, the part he rarely shows to the world. Hang out in your apartment, manage the store, and experience the life of a man trying to maintain balance in a city that doesn’t forgive weakness.</p><p>But when the shutters roll down and the streets go quiet, Anton heads to the basement, a private space where there’s more than movies to rent. By night, he moves through the city as a deadly assassin, guided by the choreography of his favorite <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e thrillers. Execute devastating melee takedowns, stage environmental kills, and survive high-octane on-foot and driving chases.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Anton thinks he’s the protagonist in his story, but someone is always watching, directing from the shadows. In <em>BLACKWOOD</em>, style and brutality intertwine, and the story bends to both choice and consequence, where every fight is a reckoning, and every decision matters.</p><p><em>BLACKWOOD</em> blends tight, close-quarters combat with slow-burn storytelling. From the basement of a quiet Brooklyn DVD store to the neon-lit streets of 2012 New York’s underworld, every encounter is choreographed, every fight feels cinematic, and every choice has consequences. The quiet moments with the woman in the store remind Anton, and the player, that even in a world of darkness, glimpses of his humanity endure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_998351"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight Your Way Through the City</strong> – Gunplay is fast, stylish, and unforgiving — with fluid movement options like dives, rolls, and slides to keep the action relentless. Every encounter feels cinematic yet responsive, giving you the freedom to create your own moments of chaos.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Brutal Takedowns</strong> – <em>BLACKWOOD</em>‘s signature mechanic: countless contextual takedowns. From one-on-one hand-to-hand executions to using the environment around you, every fight is an opportunity to end your enemies with precision and style. <a title="Games > Grounded [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a>, weighty, and satisfying to master.</li><li><strong>A Double Life to Balance</strong> – Your store is more than just a front — it’s where you live, decorate, and roleplay a “normal” existence. Buy and sell DVDs, change outfits, interact with your apartment, and explore small <a title="Genres > RPG [17,689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> elements that make your dual identity feel tangible. The contrast between day and night defines the world and the choices you make.</li><li><strong>Cinematic Storytelling</strong> – With Marvel-style narrative flair, <em>BLACKWOOD</em> introduces a cast of flawed, human characters navigating a violent city full of secrets. Every ad, tattoo, and poster tells a story. Every mission pulls you deeper into a web of conspiracies and consequences.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
