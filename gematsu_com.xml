However, what awaits is a constantly changing world. The true story behind <em>Million Depth</em> differs between timelines, and Moma’s fate too changes with the world around her.</p><p>Moma’s past decisions have consequences that ripple into the future and even other timelines in unimaginable ways.

Barter with the shopkeepers while keeping a keen eye on the value of your offer and the shopkeepers’ mood to get the best deal possible. If it goes well, they might offer you valuable items at bargain prices, but if you get too greedy, you risk upsetting the shopkeeper, who might hike the prices in response.</p><p>What’s more, the underground world is also home to a strange resource called stockinum, the value of which fluctuates constantly…</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/million-depth-launches-november-12]]></content:encoded>
