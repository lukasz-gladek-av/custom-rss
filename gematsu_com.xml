Joined by her plushie Gabe-chan, Rem must once again dive deep into her subconscious and fight literal sleep demons to enjoy peace once more. But now, the nightmares keep changing.</p><p>Flying about procedurally-generated arenas, blasting away twisted versions of youthful fears like terrifying dentist tools, broccoli monsters, and aggressive chihuahua ghouls in 360-degree combat. At the start of each run, combine three weapons and three accessories to optimize Rem’s attacks to collect souls to progress and unlock upgrades. Use Gabe-chan’s special abilities to help turn the tide against the apparitions.</p><p>Fight through 50 procedurally-generated stages in randomized order, swapping out weapons and abilities as needed. Play through new series of levels each time, or use a simple code to replay a favorite seed of levels. Fight dangerous new bosses, navigate new hazards, in an experience that combines quick pick-up-and-play action while giving NeverAwake veterans new challenges in a familiar environment.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
