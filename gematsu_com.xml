The legend tells that, at the center of the village, there was an ancient temple, now disappeared, the scene of a tragedy that has cursed all its inhabitants.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p><ul><li>Sinister manifestations suggest ancient forces keeping watch over the village.</li><li><a title="Genres > Survival [443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> requires players to hide from enemies instead of confronting them directly.</li><li>Discovering diaries and letters provides historical and emotional context.</li><li>Lost stories are unveiled as players navigate through the village’s winding paths.</li></ul><p><strong>Village Themes</strong></p><p>Kirisame Mura is designed to be an enigma in itself, a labyrinth with no exit that symbolizes the cycle of wrong decisions and broken destinies of the protagonist. The game’s structure emphasizes this aspect with an environment that subtly repeats and changes, challenging players to find a way to break the cycle as they delve into the story. Themes of envy, ambition, and failure will be explored.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="BrokenLore: LOW - Official Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hoRx3gr4Hi4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/brokenlore-low-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-on-september-15]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Q&amp;A</strong></p><p><strong>Is Swords of Legends a canonical sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> franchise, or more of a spin-off?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is the official sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> single-player series developed by Shanghai Aurogon Studio. Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, it will further expand the series’ universe and lore.</p><p><strong>Is it a premium single-player title or a <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> live-service project? Which platforms will it launch on? Will there be a mobile version?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is a premium single-player title planned for release on PC and consoles, with no mobile version. It is not a free-to-play title.</p><p><strong>What’s the game genre? Is it Soulslike? Is it open world?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is an action RPG with a strong, well-paced main story and rich cinematic storytelling, complemented by side quests and deep exploration. Neither a Soulslike nor a fully <a title="Genres > Open-World [696 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a>, the gameplay structure is closer to a “wide linear” experience, allowing players to approach the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,470 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> at their own pace within the guided progression.</p><p><strong>We noticed a clear shift in art direction and atmosphere compared to earlier entries. What kind of story are you telling this time?</strong></p><p>As always, the game is set in an original fantasy world inspired by Chinese mythology and mystical folklore. This time, we’re expanding the <em>Gujian</em> universe by placing players in the role of an “Underworld Enforcer”—a unique figure who traverses between the realms of the living and the dead. You may have spotted familiar figures like the Ox-Head and Horse-Face guardians in the trailer; they will act as companions on your journey.</p><p>However, this is not a mere retelling of classic myths—players will personally guide lost souls, helping them resolve lingering regrets. Each soul has a deeply personal backstory. For example, in the trailer, you saw a woman dancing before a set of bronze bells, unable to let go of her attachment to the mortal world, willing to pay any price to remain.</p><p><strong>How challenging is the combat?</strong></p><p>We are not aiming for punishing difficulty or purely skill-gated combat. For example, “soul capturing” is both a narrative mechanic to the story and a core combat build. Players can capture the souls of certain monsters and summon them to assist in battle, with some offering <a title="Genres > Co-Op [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> combo attacks—such as the special drop attack triggered in the trailer when fighting alongside the Ox-Head and Horse-Face. Exploration will also yield a variety of utility items to aid in combat, and flexible weapon-skill loadouts will allow players to adapt to different enemy types. Our goal is to ensure players of all skill levels can have fun—and, as in any good <a title="Genres > RPG [17,506 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, enjoy the satisfying journey of growing stronger.</p><p><strong>I’ve never played any game of <em>Gujian</em> franchise before. Will I need to catch up on the previous titles to enjoy this one?</strong></p><p>No. Each entry in the <em>Gujian</em> franchise tells a standalone, complete story, and this installment is no exception—it introduces new characters and a self-contained narrative.</p><p><strong>What’s the current development status? Will the game be ready soon?</strong></p><p>Back in 2021, we were still in the early stages of initiating the project and conducting preliminary research. We set very high-quality expectations for the new title, and after exploring various technical approaches, we decided to develop it using Unreal Engine 5. This choice came with a significant budget requirement, which was a major challenge at the time.</p><p>While learning the engine, we also carried out early-stage research and planning. In early 2024, we secured investment, allowing the Swords of Legends team to gradually expand. As a result, the game has been in full development for about two years.</p><p>We have now entered the mass production stage, and with the release of the first trailer, we aim to showcase our progress so far and attract more exceptional talent to join our team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/single-player-chinese-action-rpg-swords-of-legends-formerly-gujian-4-revealed-for-consoles-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
