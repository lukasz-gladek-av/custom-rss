A release date has yet to be announced. <span id="more-959489"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is Freeflow Gun Fu?</strong></p><p>Today’s trailer showcases <em>SPINE</em>‘s Freeflow Gun Fu combat in which the protagonist, Redline, moves from enemy to enemy, parrying and disarming them, and turning their own weapons against them in seamless combos. Players can creatively use the physical environment against Redline’s opponents – crushing enemies against surfaces, throwing them from ledges, and fighting back with makeshift melee weapons for truly cinematic combat sequences that are different every time.</p><p>“Freeflow Gun Fu combat means constant tactical awareness—both of your enemies and of the surroundings in which you fight,” said <em>SPINE</em> director Dmitry Pimenov. “For us, everything comes back to that cinematic experience, while always giving players complete control. We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action.”</p><p><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer also includes the first tease of <em>SPINE</em>‘s Hardcore mode. <em>SPINE</em>‘s cinematic twist on “no-hit” gameplay sees Redline wear sunglasses which will only remain intact if the player makes it through the game untouched by enemy attacks.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the new trailer below.

During <a title="Genres > Rhythm [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>play, you only need two buttons: a button for up and a button for down.

        <p>All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here.

There’s modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!) and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as “beat a song on easy mode” to, one may presume, something as complicated as “solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.” That’s not a real example.</p></blockquote><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Demo Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: GAMEPLAY TRAILER 2.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwKFOZeJukA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
