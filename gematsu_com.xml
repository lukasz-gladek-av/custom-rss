Developed by the Brazilian studio Ilex Games, players take control of the Solar Champion, a long-dead Plutonian resurrected by the primordial light of the Sun. Tasked with reactivating a mysterious interdimensional fortress, the Champion must restore balance to the multiverse.</p><p>As players battle through a series of diverse, interconnected biomes and confront brutal mutant bosses, they will unlock new abilities and enhancements—each revealing deeper layers of the game’s enigmatic, cosmic narrative. The game lives in the spiritual landscape of the original <em>Adventure</em>, brimming with its core elements of exploration, curiosity, and hidden secrets. Not a remake or sequel, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> instead asks players to search for subtle references to the very first adventure game as they journey through a remarkably deep world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.</li><li><strong>Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes a timeless feel while offering something entirely new.</li><li><strong>Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.</li><li><strong>Easter Eggs</strong> – Discover nods to the original Adventure, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.</li><li><strong>Collectible Items</strong> – Find hidden items, cached away in hard-to-reach corners, to improve your stats and load augments to enhance your abilities and skills.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Adventure of Samsara - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeF5P4h3WHc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/adventure-of-samsara-launches-september-4]]></content:encoded>

The game introduced players to a colorful cast of characters who embarked on an adventure to uncover the secrets of their island. The DX version of the title will introduce new playable characters including Agatha, Kilo and Romy. Players will also be able to discover events happening in parallel with the main storyline, such as the encounter of Kilo and Bos in the Underworld, and other events that took place between <em>Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout DX</em> and <em>Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy DX</em>.</p><p>Released in 2021, the second title in the <em>Secret</em> series takes place three years after the events of the first title. The game follows Ryza and her friends as they are confronted with a major decision and new secrets to uncover while searching for gates to the Underworld. In <em>Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy DX</em>, players will be able to play as Empel and Lila, while discovering a new episode in which the two companions meet Ryza at the capital to help her in her journey as she explores a new map.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_982122"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key DX</em> completes the <em>Secret</em> series and takes players one year after the events depicted in <em>Atelier Ryza 2</em>. Players will follow Ryza and her friends on their final summer adventure as they attempt to save their island and discover the secret of the “Code of the Universe.” In addition to reuniting with beloved characters from previous episodes and meeting new companions, players will also be able to play as new characters from <em>Atelier Ryza</em> and <em>Atelier Ryza 2</em>, such as Clifford, Serri, and Kilo. The DX version will introduce a new side story following Clifford and Serri after their separation from Ryza. The two will team up and embark on a journey to help each other achieve their own goals. Fans will also discover a new event that delves deeper into the relationship between Kilo and Bos, as well as explore a new island and its mysterious ruins.</p><p>Lastly, all games will include quality-of-life improvements and new features to enrich players’ experience, such as the addition of a “Custom Combat” mode in which they will be able to choose the level and combination of monsters they want to face. In <em>Atelier Ryza 2</em>, Fi will follow and support Ryza as she explores ruins, helping her find clues, or restoring a small amount of the party members’ health in battles. <em>Atelier Ryza 3</em> will introduce a new mount, the “Wind Beast,” which automatically gathers ingredients during exploration.
