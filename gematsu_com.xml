Stomp enemies, blast through barrels, and ride rockets, minecarts, and even Rambi the Rhino in 80 levels across nine worlds, including the additional levels from the <a title="Platforms > 3DS [3,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/3ds">Nintendo 3DS</a> version. You can even join up with a buddy for two-player local <a title="Genres > Co-Op [230 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play!</p><p><strong>Stomp, Blast, and Roll Across Donkey Kong Island</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Platform your way across DK Island’s vibrant and obstacle-filled levels. You’ll be stomping and rolling through environments ranging from jungle to volcano.</p><ul><li><strong>Swing Into <a title="Genres > Action [2,463 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> as Donkey Kong</strong> – Some levels will have you swinging on vines, blasting through barrels,  or riding things like mine carts, rockets, and Rambi the Rhino.</li><li><strong>Deal With Obstacles and Enemies the DK Way</strong> – Execute moves like Ground Pound, Roll, Blow, and Grab and Cling.</li></ul><p><strong>Work Together to Find Those Bananas!</strong></p><p>Team up with a friend and take on the Tiki Tak Tribe together as DK and Diddy in two-player local cooperative play. Pelt foes with Diddy’s Peanut Popgun and hover using his Barrel Jet. If you’re playing solo, break open a DK barrel to find Diddy Kong—he’ll take damage instead of DK!</p><p><strong>Meet the Top Bananas</strong></p><p>Play as Donkey Kong or join the fun as Diddy Kong in two-player local co-op to take down the evil Tiki Tak tribe. You’ll meet some wild characters along the way!</p><ul><li><strong>Donkey Kong</strong> (playable) – This powerful Kong goes absolutely bananas when it comes to jumping and pounding. He wears a fancy tie, but he still likes to crash through branches and boxes in the jungle.</li><li><strong>Diddy Kong</strong> (playable) – He might look harmless to jungle baddies, but this small Kong is a peanut-popping powerhouse! He can ride on Donkey Kong’s back and blast his buddy to new heights with his Rocket Barrel.</li><li><strong>Cranky Kong</strong> – Stooped in stature but sizeable in spirit, the curmudgeonly Cranky Kong runs a shop which supplies Donkey Kong with the items needed to rid the jungle of banana-nabbing baddies.</li><li><strong>Rambi</strong> – Donkey Kong can smash his way through a box or two, but he needs this rambunctious rhino to power through stone blocks (and the occasional enemy).</li><li><strong>Tiki Tak Tribe</strong> – This troublesome tribe can’t mask their thieving nature. With a bit of hocus pocus, these musical hypnotists can turn the gentle beasts of the jungle into fearsome foes.</li><li><strong>Squawks</strong> – A brightly colored bird which can be purchased with in-game coins in Cranky Kong’s shop. Squawks will let you know when puzzle pieces are nearby.</li><li><strong>Professor Chops</strong> – This helpful porcine offers tips as you make your way through each level. He will indicate the halfway point where your progress is saved.</li></ul><p><strong>Explore, Collect, and Unlock</strong></p><p>Search every inch of the jungle to uncover special items and unlock extras.</p><ul><li><strong>K-O-N-G Letters</strong> – Letters spelling K-O-N-G are spaced throughout each level. Collect all the letters in all the stages of a world to unlock that world’s temple, where a <a title="Companies > Rare [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios/rare">Rare</a> Orb can be found.</li><li><strong>Puzzle Pieces</strong> – Puzzle pieces are hidden in out-of-the-way places. Get all the puzzle pieces in a level to unlock something in the gallery.</li></ul><p><strong>Two Ways to Play</strong></p><p>Play the game as it was first designed for the Wii system or reduce the difficulty for extra hearts and other goodies to make your journey a little easier.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
