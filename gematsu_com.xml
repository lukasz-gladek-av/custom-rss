It is a curse of death that consumes the continent. A Warlock who coveted Death, devoured people and animals and enveloped the world in despair. For thousands of years the line of kings has sealed the Abyss. But now, the king has vanished, and the world is being consumed by death, moment by moment. Resistance itself is meaningless. There is naught but to perish.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><em>Wizardry Variants Daphne</em> is a 3D dungeon RPG, a completely new addition to the <em>Wizardry</em> series. The game system follows the play cycle of the traditional 3D dungeon RPGs, with players progressing deeper into dungeons called Abyss, by repeatedly getting stronger, resupplying in towns, and battling and collecting items in dungeons. Battles with enemies proceed in a command battle system, and a formation of up to six characters, including the player, can enjoy highly strategic battles that make full use of spells and skills.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
