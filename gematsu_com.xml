Each dream world is governed by a set of Key Rules, or Keys. By deciphering these rules, you can grasp the logic of that world, making it easier to choose <a title="Genres > Action [2,754 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s that lead to the truth. At first, the Keys appear blank, but as you progress, the sentences explaining them gradually fill in. In the early stages, experimentation and trial-and-error are essential for discovering the rules. Later, it becomes crucial to act in accordance with the completed Key Rules.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Sleep-For-Kaname-Date-From-AI-The-Somnium-Files_2025_06-02-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Nintendo Switch 2 Physical Version</strong></p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 physical version will be released as a game-key card.
