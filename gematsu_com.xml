      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Team17 [209 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team17">Team17</a> and developer <a title="Companies > BULKHEAD" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bulkhead">BULKHEAD</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > WARDOGS" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/wardogs">WARDOGS</a></em>, a “tactical all-out warfare <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,859 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a>” that promises to be a new take on large-scale <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,384 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>s. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026. <span id="more-1024418"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>WARDOGS</em> is an all-out warfare first-person shooter that combines tactical gunplay and combined arms combat with building and destruction mechanics in a large-scale, up to 100-player militaristic sandbox.</p><p>The game mode—inspired by “King of the Hill”—has three teams fight for control of a randomized 2x2km “Control Zone” within a 256km² map. The team with the most players within the Control Zone earns points—the first team to reach 100 points wins the match. The variables in zone location and individual player tactics mean no match ever plays out the same.</p><p><strong>Persistent Cash <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>game</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>WARDOGS</em>—Every. Decision. Matters.</p><p>Every player starts their journey with $10,000. Each life, you purchase a custom loadout from a wide selection of weapons, gear, utility, and vehicles to help your team win the match.</p><p>Every teamplay action you perform rewards cash. From reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective. We don’t just encourage teamplay; we reward it. It’s the player’s choice how they want to play, earn and spend their profits.</p><p>Cash persists from match to match, so spending big on better gear, equipment, or a vehicle at the right time has the potential to turn the tide of battle and could yield massive returns.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1024429"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play Your Way</strong></p><p>You choose how you want to play and profit.</p><p>There’s no one way to play, earn and progress. Instead, <em>WARDOGS</em> gives players the freedom to take on the Control Zone in any number of ways. Whether you’re a lone wolf helping out your team or part of a dedicated squad, how you approach the battlefield is entirely up to you.</p><p>You could chase the “Hot Zone” to earn double the cash, purchase a ghillie suit and snipe from a distance, or ferry supplies to teammates by helicopter. Additionally, you could choose to fortify a strategic chokepoint by building your own forward operating base, or if you’re feeling destructive… man an artillery tank and rain down destruction on the enemy.</p><p>There are no set rules of engagement. It’s ultimately your choice how you want to approach the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Destruction and Base Building</strong></p><p>Bring the chaos to tactical warfare.</p><p>Destroy apartment blocks with rocket launchers or tear your way through towns in heavily armored tanks. The world around you reacts to your presence. Conversely, strategize with your teammates to build upon and fortify key locations within the map for a tactical advantage.</p><p><strong>100 Percent Player-Driven Sandbox</strong></p><p>Every Moment in <em>WARDOGS</em> is 100 percent player driven and tied together with local voice chat to either talk tactics with teammates or troll enemy players. This is not another “<a title="Genres > Battle Royale [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">battle royale</a>.” This is not another “extraction shooter.” <em>WARDOGS</em> is a new Tactical take on the all-out warfare first-person shooter genre that rewards decision making, communication and teamwork—and allows you to play how you want within a modern militaristic setting.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
