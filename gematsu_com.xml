The “hardest boss to date” will lie in wait at the end.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Card-en-Ciel_New-Dungeons_11-06-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Card-en-Ciel_New-Dungeons_11-06-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Additionally, Inti Creates has released the <em>Card-en-Ciel</em> soundtrack on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3306340/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $24.99, or 10 percent off in a bundle with the full game.
