You can take to the clouds on your own or team up with friends, and every decision opens a new story. That spirit of discovery is what drives us.”</p><p>The Early Access version of the game features its core systems and mechanics, allowing players to explore one large region of the world, made up of procedurally generated islands. Within this area, players can progress through <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> and combat to unlock Tier 2 weapons, tools, and airship components, culminating in a boss encounter.
