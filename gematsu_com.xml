      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Sony Group Corporation [1,296 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation">Sony Group Corporation</a> has signed a strategic capital and business alliance agreement with <a title="Companies > Kadokawa Corporation [587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kadokawa-corporation">Kadokawa Corporation</a> to conduct a third-party allotment on January 7, 2025 to acquire 12,054,100 new shares of Kadokawa Corporation for approximately 50 billion yen (approx. $320 million USD), the company <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a>. With this acquisition of shares, Sony Group Corporation will become Kadokawa Corporation’s largest shareholder, holding approximately 10 percent of it shares, including the shares it <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/02/kadokawa-corporation-forms-capital-alliance-with-cyberagent-and-sony-to-strengthen-game-and-animation-businesses">previously acquired</a> in February 2021. Sony Group Corporation currently does not plan to acquire additional Kadokawa Corporation shares after the execution of the acquisition. <span id="more-928885"></span></p><p>Kadokawa Corporation is the parent company of numerous subsidiaries across publishing, film and visuals, and cross media.

In the future, the two companies plan to discuss specific initiatives for collaboration, such as initiatives to adapt Kadokawa’s [intellectual property] into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa’s anime works through the Sony Group, further expand publishing of Kadokawa’s games, and develop human resources to promote and expand virtual production.</p></blockquote><p>“We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony,” said Kadokawa Corporation chief executive officer Takeshi Natsuno in a press release. “This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our [intellectual property] creation capabilities, but also increase our [intellectual property] media mix options with Sony’s support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our [intellectual property] to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our [intellectual property] and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market.”</p><p>Sony Group Corporation president, chief operating officer, and chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki added, “Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of [intellectual property], including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive [intellectual property] and [intellectual property] creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its [intellectual property], and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.'”</p><!-- AD: content -->

In addition, the Company has been continuously evaluating capital and business alliances and other partnerships that contribute to discontinuous growth as one measure in response to a global business environment in which IP is rapidly growing in importance.<br>In February 2021, the Company made a new share issuance through a third-party allotment to Sony, with the aim of strengthening the long-term relationship between the two companies. Through this third-party allotment, the Company has worked to enhance its IP “global media mix” by combining global development capabilities of Sony and its affiliates (hereinafter “Sony Group”) in animation and consumer gaming with the Company’s own content, while leveraging the strengths of both companies in terms of business and know-how. As a result of discussions with Sony, it was determined that further strengthening the capital alliance would reinforce and accelerate the “global media mix” strategy with a view to the global market including the construction of a business foundation that will create a more diverse range of IP, further strengthening of development, production and distribution of animation, video games and film, and acceleration of the Company’s ability to expand into merchandising products and music IP, and has entered into the Capital and Business Alliance Agreement with Sony.</li><li data-list-text="2.">Outline of the Capital and Business Alliance<ol><li data-list-text="(1)">Details of the Capital Alliance<br>The Company will issue new shares through a third-party allotment (12,054,100 shares of common stock; percentage of the total number of issued shares after the Third-Party Allotment: 7.83%), and Sony will subscribe for those shares.<br>In addition, Sony has agreed not to transfer the common stock of the Company to any third party for a period of one year from the date the Third-Party Allotment is implemented without the Company’s prior written consent.

The Company’s basic strategy, set out in the medium-term management plan, is “Global Media Mix with<br>Technology,” and it is working to achieve “maximization of IP LTV” by enhancing IP creation, media mix, overseas development, and licensing development, as well as working to achieve continuous business growth through expanding the Education/EdTech business and improving fan community management. In addition, with its corporate mission of “A platform for Creativity” that discovers talent and brings their content to a global audience, and under the keywords of creativity, motivation, and technology, the Company is working to create innovation by developing internal infrastructure that allows every employee to maximize their creativity. The Company believes that an appropriate and stable financial base is essential in order to achieve sustainable growth through this “Global Media Mix with Technology.”<br>In deliberating the Third-Party Allotment, the Company considered multiple methods of financing that would enhance corporate value, including bank loans, corporate bonds, and other debt financing, and determined that the<br>optimal method would be a combination of the share issuance through the Third-Party Allotment and the cancellation of a portion of its treasury shares, as this would enable the Company to strengthen its relationship with Sony Group. Through the Third-Party Allotment, the Company aims to achieve sustainable enhancement of its corporate value by expanding its equity capital and reinforcing its financial base and by promoting collaborations with the strategic<br>partners such as Sony.<br>For details of the Capital and Business Alliance and the cancellation of treasury shares, please see “I.

In addition to planning and development of large-scale animated series and films, live-action films, drama series, and video games for the global market, and discovery of new creators through expansion of user-generated content (UGC) platforms, the Company also envisages acquiring the content holders including publishers, anime production companies, and game companies in Japan and overseas. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of engaging in collaborations with Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of creating an enriched and unique IPs comprising a diversified portfolio of books, films, anime, games and UGC platforms, and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 20 billion yen for the creation, development and acquisition of new IP.

In addition to this, the Company will work to build a foundation to expand the scope of video game publishing. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of using platforms owned by Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of multimedia deployment since the 1970s originating from its book- to-film adaptations and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 29.7 billion yen to enhance global distribution of its IP.

The price was determined after discussions with Sony as well as comprehensive consideration of factors such as the dilution that would occur as a result of the Third-Party Allotment, and the fact that the medium- to long-term corporate value and shareholder value are expected to increase as a result of the Third-Party Allotment and the Capital and Business Alliance.<br>Moreover, the price represents (i) 94.92% (a discount of 5.08%) of the simple average closing price of 4,368 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the one- month period (from November 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date,<br>(ii) 114.50% (a premium of 14.50%) of the simple average closing price of 3,621 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) for the three-month period (from September 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date, and (iii) 128.84% (a premium of 28.84%) of the simple average closing price of 3,218 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) for the six-month period (from June 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date, and has been determined not to constitute favorable discounted pricing.<br>In addition, the Company’s Audit Committee (comprised of three outside directors) expressed the opinion that the issuance price is based on the market price, which objectively represents the value of the Company’s common stock, and complies with the “Rules Concerning Handling of Allotment of New Shares to Third Party, Etc.” issued by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and does not constitute favorable discounted pricing.</li><li data-list-text="(2)">Rationale for Issuance Quantity and Dilution</li></ol><p>The number of shares of the Company to be issued through the Third-Party Allotment is 12,054,100 shares (number of voting rights: 120,541), which is equivalent to 8.50% of the total 141,784,120 issued shares of common stock of the Company as of September 30, 2024 (8.91% of the total 1,352,559 voting rights; rounded off to two decimal places), which will result in a certain degree of dilution.<br>However, based on the expected increase in growth and profitability through the appropriation of the capital procured through the Third-Party Allotment as described in “(2) Specific Use of Procured Capital” in “3.
