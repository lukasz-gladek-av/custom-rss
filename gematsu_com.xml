It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-969775"></span></p><p>Here are the first details, via <a title="Companies > XD [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xd">XD</a>EV senior producer Reed Baird on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p><a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,712 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios, Arc System Works, and Marvel Games have joined forces to realize the latest in tag team fighters, <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>! <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Marvel Universe like never before with reimagined characters and stages, a heart-pounding soundtrack, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and jaw-dropping visuals that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Whether this is your first fighting game or you are a veteran of the genre, Arc System Works has incorporated gameplay controls and mechanics that are easy to pick up and play, and yet still offer the depth and versatility for high level competition.</p><p>“From the beginning, we aimed to make <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> a title that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players,” explains game director and lead battle designer, Kazuto Sekine.</p><p>“Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, you only need to master one character in order to play the game. We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of <a title="Genres > Action [2,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together—creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience.”</p><p>“Since day one, our long-time and trusted collaborators at PlayStation and the team at Arc System Works have poured incredible amounts of talent and passion into reimagining the Marvel Universe in a way that only they can,” said Michael Francisco, Senior Product Development <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, Marvel Games. “<em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> demonstrates that they are absolute masters of their craft and are true Marvel fans at heart. Players are in for a wild ride.”</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_969850"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><p>Enter the fray with iconic Marvel heroes and villains such as Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)—each with Arc System Works’ unique twist on their character designs and gameplay styles.</p><p>Arc System Works Producer, Takeshi Yamanaka, states, “There are so many amazing Marvel characters that it was quite a struggle to choose our roster, but we did have some criteria for the selection process. First and foremost, we wanted to include characters who we feel to be the ‘face’ of Marvel. At the same time, we also needed to select characters that would give us a balance of battle types and styles. Lastly, we wanted to sprinkle in a few surprises and leave room for characters who have never been playable in a fighting game before.”</p><p>Yamanaka-san continues, “Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style, but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more [Arc System Works]-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style [Arc System Works] is known for.”</p><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p><p>From short-ranged jabs to the cinematic Ultimate Skills, each character features a bespoke set of Normal, Special, and Unique attacks inspired by their abilities and powers in Marvel lore. Arc System Works has gone to great lengths to ensure that gameplay style, movement, and feel of these legendary characters is fresh, new, and wholly unique to <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>.</p><p>But it’s not just the individual gameplay of the characters that has been enhanced; significant dedication has gone into reimagining and redefining what it means to be a tag team fighter.</p><p>“Team VS fighting games have a long tradition of two-versus-two or three-versus-three team formats, so this is something we discussed in-depth within the development team. We went back and forth many times, from thinking we might be better off making a one-versus-one game or sticking to the established three-versus-three format.”</p><p>Sekine-san continues, “At its core, we felt that the appeal of team VS fighting games is the intensity of battles with multiple characters on screen at once. Additionally, one of the appeals of Marvel comics is seeing the vast cast of characters coming together to create all kinds of unique team-ups.”</p><p>“With these two ideas in mind, we concluded that creating a four-versus-four team VS system would be the best way to not only create those over-the-top moments, but to further evolve the tag fighting genre.”</p><p><strong>Stages</strong></p><p>The stages come to life in <em>MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, filled with easter eggs for eagle-eyed fans to find. Most stages also feature multiple areas. These transitions between areas are not just action-packed and stunning to witness, but they also play a strategic role. Check out the screenshots from Marvel’s New York City to see what you can find.</p><p><strong>More to Come</strong></p><p>Today’s announcement is just the beginning of our journey. From characters and stages to gameplay modes and the online experience. There’s so much more we can’t wait to share with you!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a developer diary below.
