        <p><strong>A Letter from the Developers</strong></p><p>To everyone who has been waiting for this game, we are truly sorry.</p><p>The release date has been moved to “2026.” We apologize for keeping you waiting yet again. The support we’ve received, from the excitement voiced across various communities to the feedback from players who tried the demo at events, has been a tremendous source of encouragement for our team. We are deeply grateful.</p><p>This project involves implementing an unusual system into the game. We believe this system will make the experience truly one-of-a-kind, but such an ambitious approach also presents significant challenges.</p><p>There were moments when we wondered if perhaps creating a game like this was too early for us—or even for humanity—but after much trial and error, the final vision is gradually taking shape. Because we want to present the game at its best, we kindly ask for a little more time.</p><p>Additionally, because of how the game plays, the user interface, and story all change based on the player’s actions. Which means even sharing small bits of information becomes potential spoilers. This has made it difficult to communicate ongoing progress through social media, even though development is continuing steadily each day under director EIKI.</p><p>We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we can share this game with all of you, and we hope you will look forward to it as well. Your patience would mean the world to us.</p><p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <em>EDEN.schemata();</em>.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/eden-schemata-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing—spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Second Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!
