        <p><em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>‘s free-to-play destination also includes Gauntlet, a new mode which pushes squad competition to a new level of intensity. In this fast-paced elimination mode, eight teams of four-player squads compete in a series of dynamic round-based missions in a tournament-style format. Each round consists of 5-minute windows for squads to complete their mission objectives. Prepare for the unexpected as each round, location, and mission will be unique variables.</p><p>Players can also go beyond the lines in <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> and change the rules of engagement with <em>Battlefield Portal</em>. With this toolset, players can create or discover their own <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> experiences on the diverse and ever evolving Fort Lyndon playspace. Create a grueling battle environment with sledgehammers only, fight against the best of the best in a headshot contest or create something truly unexpected, with these powerful scripting and customization tools, all available within the Fort Lyndon sandbox for free.</p><p><strong>Season 1</strong></p><p>Starting today across all platforms, Season 1 will offer three distinct phases of content up through the holiday season. Season 1’s first phase called “Rogue Operations” launches today and features three new weapons, a new map, a new close quarters and high intensity <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [628 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode called Strikepoint, and much more. The new map Blackwell Fields is the latest large-scale all-out-war experience, set in the arid shrublands of Southern California, while the new mode Strikepoint brings <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>‘s high stakes gameplay into multiplayer with its squad-focus, one-life experience in four-versus-four combat. The mode pits small teams against each other in fast rounds, battling over a single capture point.</p><p>Season 1 also sees the release of “Rogue Operations” themed Battle Pass with 100 tiers, six total paths and 10 prestige tiers. A premium BF Pro tier and premium store content is also available today.</p><p>Two more Season 1 content releases follow this year, with California Resistance launching on November 18 and Winter Offensive launching on December 9. California Resistance includes a new map set in the suburbs of Southern California and a new mode called Sabotage where players must destroy as many sites as possible before the round ends. While Winter Offensive includes special seasonal themed content.</p><p>Seasonal content will be released on a consistent basis, adding maps, modes, weapons, and more. All gameplay-impacting features will be free or earnable as part of our commitment to fair play and access for all players. As done with <em>Battlefield Labs</em>, Battlefield Studios will continue to build both <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> with players, taking their invaluable feedback into account as these games grow and the <em>Battlefield</em> universe expands.</p></div><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/battlefield-redsec-now-available-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
