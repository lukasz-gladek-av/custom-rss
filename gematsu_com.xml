I’m truly delighted that what we’ve created together as a team can cross borders and reach people all over the world.</p><p>“Also, by facing this project together with such talented cast members from various fields, I feel the game has gained depth and even sparked a kind of chemistry. It’s an unknown challenge, but as I imagine people around the world picking up and enjoying this game, I know I’ll want to grab a controller myself.”</p><p><strong>◆ Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura)<br>Maid</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid cafe in Akihabara.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident.</p><p>While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Sayuri Matsumura, and I play the maid in <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>“I’m thrilled that my long-time dream of becoming a ‘resident of the 2D world’ in the anime and game universe I love has finally come true. From Akihabara, we’re bringing the culture that Japan is proud of to the world.</p><p>“We did a lot of shooting. A LOT.</p><p>“The unique filming method used for games was completely new to me, and it revealed connections and hidden hints in the story that you can’t fully grasp from the script alone. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone enjoy discovering them while playing.</p><p>“Each cast member has a carefully crafted story, which is truly impressive.</p><p>“I hope everyone dives deep into the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>!”</p><p><strong>◆ Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe)<br>Game Streamer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games.</p><p>A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers.</p><p>His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“It was such an honor to play a character in a game for the first time! In dramas and films, audiences usually enjoy witnessing our characters’ lives, but in this game, becoming the protagonist and ‘choosing’ the story yourself is such a fresh experience.</p><p>“There are cinematic scenes, but many are depicted in still images, so for me—someone used to acting in full-motion video—the challenge was to convey a real, lifelike sense of presence so players can truly enjoy the game.</p><p>“In life, we make many ‘choices’—big decisions as well as small, everyday ones. I hope players enjoy the world they encounter when they experience these choices through the story.”</p><p><strong>◆ Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)<br>Gourmet Writer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food.</p><p>Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafes and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I grew up playing games like <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em>Zelda</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> without even realizing it, and I take pride in everything I’ve learned from them. That’s why it’s such an honor to actually be part of a game myself.</p><p>“My character, Moe Kurosu, is outwardly a playful, big-eating older sister, but she is also a tough, strong-willed adult woman. Portraying this duality was a challenge on set.</p><p>“While I was initially unsure about the unique filming style used for games, I had so much fun collaborating with the staff to bring the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to life. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Kokone Nagato</strong> (portayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48)<br>Underground Idol</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched.
