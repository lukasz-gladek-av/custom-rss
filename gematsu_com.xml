Closed Beta sign-ups are now open.</p><p>In <em>Petit Planet</em>, players are entrusted to nurture a planet of their own and gradually form a galaxy by connecting with different planets scattered across the starry sky. The journey begins on each player’s planet, where <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y Neighbors can connect their home planets. As bonds deepen and planets flourish, Luca, the planet’s vitality, will shape each unique planet with different landscapes, brimming with life and energy.</p><p>As a life sim, <em>Petit Planet</em> unfolds everyday life with various joyful yet relaxing activities—planting, fishing, beachcombing, mining, <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and <a title="Genres > Crafting [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>.

These fuzzy companions can be invited to settle, and friendships can grow through heartfelt conversations, thoughtful gift exchanges, and unique interactions that make every bond distinct. As the planet prospers, so do the friendships upon it. <em>Petit Planet</em> weaves relationship building into daily activities to unlock deeper connections, turning ordinary encounters into cosmic wonders.</p><p>Even so, connections built in <em>Petit Planet</em> are never confined to your own planet. Players may board their trusty vehicle with helpful Neighbors to take a Starsea Voyage, venturing into unknown <a title="Games > Islets [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/islets">Islets</a>, discovering rare creatures, uncovering hidden recipes, and forging unexpected friendships across the galaxy. Beyond exploration lies the Galactic Bazaar, an ever-bustling social hub where conversations spark over coffee, festival events bring joy to the sky, and friendships are formed with other players, turning a fleeting moment into a lasting connection.</p><p>Featuring 3D cartoony and stylized art, <em>Petit Planet</em> marks <a title="Companies > HoYoverse [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo/hoyoverse">HoYoverse</a>‘s first step into the life simulation genre.

That shared love and passion for the quintessential slasher is one of the many reasons why our team is so honored and excited to collaborate with Malek Akkad, Ryan Freimann, and Gun Interactive to bring the world of Haddonfield and the iconic masked murderer Michael Myers to players in the first major <em>Halloween</em> video game. We’re even more excited to partner with <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> to share our first look at gameplay and the official release date for <em>Halloween</em>.</p><p>From its earliest iterations, <em>Halloween</em> has been crafted to deliver an immersive horror sandbox experience that can be enjoyed through a standalone singleplayer story or dynamic asymmetrical multiplayer matches. We wanted to empower players to create their very own horror movie moments, whether they’re stepping behind the mask of Michael Myers or taking the role of one of the heroic residents of Haddonfield. Our team is working diligently to ensure this quiet suburban town is brimming with 70s-era charm and effectively serves as a virtual playground filled with innocent townsfolk that players can either save or slaughter.</p><p>As Michael, your goal is to find, stalk, and kill the residents of Haddonfield before Halloween night ends. While the aptly named “Boogeyman” lurks in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, the townsfolk NPCs are innocently living their lives, engaged in everyday household activities. In an effort to properly embody the personification of evil, players have the freedom to leverage the terrifying power of Michael Myers to creatively murder anyone unfortunate enough to cross Michael’s path. We’re offering a shocking amount of gruesome executions that are guaranteed to put huge smiles on the faces of horror enthusiasts like ourselves. We hope players have some fun with our interpretation of Michael’s inexplicable tendency to suddenly appear in completely unexpected places and catch victims off-guard with Michael’s “Shape Jump” ability as well.</p><p>Thankfully for the families of Haddonfield, our brave playable hero characters have a chance to thwart Michael’s murderous intentions and rescue their neighbors. As a Hero of Haddonfield, it’s your duty to warn those around you of Michael’s presence, convince the townsfolk NPCs to alert the authorities, and gather weapons and items that can be used to fight back against The Shape. With the right gear and some smooth-talking, you can even instruct the townsfolk to follow you to various points on the map, including a police-provided escape. For those looking to brawl with evil, it’s worth noting that while you can knock Michael down to buy precious time, he can’t be killed. However, with enough police presence, Michael can be detained.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When players dive into <em>Halloween</em> for the first time, we want Haddonfield to feel like a living, breathing game world. Our team aims to elevate the unpredictability and tension of each match through a series of dynamic map features, believable NPCs, robust gameplay options, haunting visuals, striking audio, and much more. We’ve developed several asymmetrical multiplayer horror titles and fully understand the desires and expectations of our players, and have been hard at work constructing something genuinely worthy of the intellectual property with <em>Halloween</em>. We’re also thrilled to offer a standalone single-player component to this package that allows players to witness key narrative events of “The Night He Came Home” through the eyes of Michael Myers.</p><p>It’s an amazing moment to present gameplay to the public for the first time, and we appreciate you all sharing it with us! While we’ve given players some pieces to chew on, it’s only a taste of what we believe is shaping up to be a truly special and murderous sandbox horror experience, and we’re looking forward to sharing more in the coming months.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Halloween Gameplay + Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bua7X-ClkgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/halloween-game-launches-september-8-2026]]></content:encoded>
