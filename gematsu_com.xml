We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team—dat’s da good stuff.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests. It’s critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come. </p><p>“Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe. We can’t wait to reveal more.</p><p>“‘Til then, we’ll do our best!
