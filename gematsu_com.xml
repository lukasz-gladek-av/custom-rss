Each day you’ll need to tidy up your store, attend to anyone who needs help, then throw a bunch of stuff on sale and see if you can make a tasty profit. Being a good Samaritan is great and all, but this fox needs to put food on the table!</p><p>Customize your shop with different colors and materials, grow plants and mix paint, spruce up the items that pass through the store, bake cookies for your neighbors, and listen to the latest gossip. There’s plenty to do in the world of Piece by Piece, and plenty of cute critters to share your story with.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
