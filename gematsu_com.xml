Its beacon, once a trusted guiding light, now threatens to unleash untold horrors upon the world. Your mission is clear: identify the ever-seeping anomalies in a bid to shut it down. But the restless entities within will fight back, their desperate whispers echoing through the halls, yearning for their dark truths to be heard. Can you silence the light before its madness consumes all?</p><p><strong>The Lighthouse Beckons</strong></p><p>Prepare for an anomaly-hunting experience unlike anything you’ve faced before. Delve into a peculiar lighthouse where secrets cling to every lavish surface, and each room dares you to uncover its truth. Here, light and shadow are more than just visual tools; they’re the game’s pulse, striking moments of awe and dread in equal measure.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Echoes in the Dark</strong></p><p>Prepare for a curated spectrum of anomalies, each one hellbent on leaving its mark. From subtle distortions that question your memory, to scenes you’ll wish you could unsee, every moment lingers… some with a shiver, some with a smirk. Balancing has been fine-tuned to keep each run fresh, compelling, and the correct amount of unhinged.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988514"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong><a title="Companies > Sile" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sile">Sile</a>nt Killer</strong></p><p>When the music stops, so should you. The ‘Red Light, Green Light’ mechanic dials up the tension, so once the music cuts out, any movement might be your last. Freeze, listen, and pray it doesn’t find you</p><p><strong>Stairway to Madness</strong></p><p>Unlockable difficulty modes turn familiarity into fear. Think you know the layout? ‘Nightmare’ mode begs to differ. Only those who’ve studied every creak and corridor survive the lighthouse at its worst.</p><p><strong>Whispers of the Past</strong></p><p>This storied lighthouse holds a past that desperately seeps its way into reality. Beyond its beautiful architecture, something is profoundly wrong here… but what?</p><p>Scattered throughout are floppy disks, each revealing a flicker into the minds of those who once lived, and perhaps died, within these walls. Their memories offer a crucial peak into the horrors you’re facing. Seek them out before they seek you! There’s no turning away from what lies within…</p><p>Immortalize your quickest times on the leaderboards in normal, hard, and nightmare modes, or test your endurance in the endless mode to see how many floors you can complete, all without getting caught!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
