Specific platform(s) will be announced at a later date. <span id="more-937198"></span></p><p>Here is the full message from the development team:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Shine Post: Be Your Idol!</em> Platform Change Announcement</strong></p><p>Thank you for your continued support despite the long wait for <em>Shine Post: Be Your Idol!</em> The reason for the delay is that we were considering how to best deliver <em>Shine Post</em>‘s game content. After carefully considering every option and repeated discussions, we have decided to change the supported platform.</p><p>The fragmented updates we have provided up until now will reset, and rather than a game design centered around mobile operations, we will rebuild the game with goal-oriented gameplay characteristic of console games.</p><p><em>Shine Post</em> is a story about idols who, while sometimes lost or discouraged, run with all their might toward their dreams. After thinking about how to properly depict these idols’ pursuit of their dreams, we came to the conclusion that offering the game on a platform other than mobile would be the best approach.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the original story, a talented manager works behind the scenes to help the idols’ dreams come true, but in this game, players will take on the role of someone who works both behind the scenes and in the spotlight to help the idols achieve their dreams. Whether their dreams come true or not will depend entirely on the player’s thoughts and decisions. We are putting all our efforts into creating something that everyone will enjoy.</p><p>That said, in order to avoid sharing uncertain information and letting everyone down, we will announce the specific platform(s) and game content, along with the release timing, at a later date. You will have to wait a little longer, but we hope to provide as many details as possible when we are able to share more. We would appreciate it if you could bear with us just a little longer.</p><p>—The <em>Shine Post: Be Your Idol!</em> Development Team</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
