        <p>IzanagiGames—known for creating cinematic game experiences such as <em><a title="Games > Death Come True [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-come-true">Death Come True</a></em>—now teams up with Nippon TV and AX-ON, leaders in Japanese drama production, to take on the challenge of a feature-length live-action game. Starring Hiromitsu Kitayama.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>13 years ago, six girls mysteriously vanished in Akihabara—an unsolved case known as “Akiba’s Spirited Away.”</p><p>At the annual Game Show, Daiki Shinjo (played by Hiromitsu Kitayama), once hailed as a “genius creator,” boldly announces the development of a new game inspired by this very incident: AKIBA LOST. But the moment he does, strange disappearances begin again.</p><p>The cast of the game includes his sister Aoi Shinjo, who works at a maid cafe, underground idol Kokone Nagato, food writer Moe Kurosu, shrine maiden Chihiro Jimbo, cosplayer Wakana Yusa, and game streamer Yukimi Kurahashi—each a colorful icon of Akihabara’s vibrant subculture.</p><p>Yet, the story they were supposed to perform soon begins to bleed into reality.</p><p>It all begins with a threatening phone call—and the sudden disappearance of Aoi.</p><p>“Cancel the game’s development—or the tragedy will repeat itself.”</p><p>Can Shinjo finish developing the game? Can he protect his friends? Who is behind it all? And what really happened thirteen years ago?</p><p>The choice that determines the ending of this story is now in your hands.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Daiki Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama) – Game creator.</li><li>More characters will be revealed in the coming months.</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Producer Comments</strong></p><p><strong>Shinsuke Umeda, IzanagiGames</strong> (Games: <em>Death Come True</em>, <em><a title="Games > Yurukill: The Calumniation Games [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/yurukill-the-calumniation-games">Yurukill: The Calumniation Games</a></em>):</p><p>In June 2020, we released Death Come True under the concept of a “cinematic live-action game.” Our next ambition was to create a feature-length ensemble live-action game. Over the course of five years, we built the foundation for this project, holding countless long meetings from the very beginning together with Nippon TV and AX-ON. This collaboration has led to the creation of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Veteran staff from the worlds of drama and film came together, filming day after day. Development continued after the shoot, and today, we are finally able to announce the project to the world.</p><p>In the story, the protagonist Shinjo strives to complete <em>AKIBA LOST</em> as a game creator. Similarly, Hiromitsu Kitayama, who plays Shinjo, led the team on set and helped bring this real-world version of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to completion.</p><p>With the combined efforts of IzanagiGames, Nippon TV, AX-ON, the cast, and our dedicated staff, we proudly present the feature-length multi-angle suspense drama <em>AKIBA LOST</em>. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Hiroki Shibata, AX-ON</strong> (Dramas: <em>Brush Up Life</em>, <em>What Day Were You Born On?</em>)</p><p>As someone whose career has been in drama production, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to work on a live-action game.</p><p>Every day, we face countless “choices.” We select one option in front of us, then move to the next… and this infinite accumulation of decisions sometimes makes us realize, “There’s no going back now.”</p><p>At the same time, in modern society there is a prevailing sense that “speed is key—make choices quickly, act, and learn through trial and error.” There is certainly some truth to this. However, even a single wrong button press can lead to irreversible consequences. That is why I wanted to craft a story themed around the choices we make in life.</p><p>In this game, you, the player, experience the lives of seven characters, face the choices that appear one after another, make decisions, and advance the story.</p><p>The protagonist is portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama, who is active across acting, music, and other entertainment fields. Although this was his first experience in the game world, his flexibility and passionate dedication to the project inspired us greatly.</p><p>The setting is Akihabara, Tokyo, a city renowned worldwide for its subculture. What kind of endings await based on the choices made by the game creator protagonist (you)? We hope you will experience it firsthand.</p><p>We, the team behind <em>AKIBA LOST</em>, are fully committed to creating a game that can become one of your life’s choices.</p><p><strong>Hirokazu Umezawa, Nippon TV</strong> (Content <a title="Genres > Strategy [282 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a> Headquarters, Business Bureau, Music &amp; Artist Center)</p><p>When I first heard about a live-action game, my immediate reaction was: “This sounds amazing!”</p><p>Although I was completely new to the world of games, I realized that this was an opportunity to leverage television’s strengths in visual direction and story structuring.</p><p>In taking on this challenge, the expertise of IzanagiGames in game production was invaluable. The result of combining television and gaming is <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Filming posed unique challenges inherent to games, but Hiromitsu Kitayama performed with remarkable skill and fully immersed himself in the role, bringing authenticity to every scene. His presence has become the “core” of this work.</p><p><em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a project that could only be created because of television, and could only be completed thanks to IzanagiGames. We hope you will experience the story through your own choices!</p><p><strong>Yushi Ito, AX-ON</strong> (Films: <em>A Place in the Kinki Region</em>, <em>Your World Ends with You</em>)</p><p>For many years, I have been creating dramas and films, portraying countless tears, smiles, and human lives. Now, I am channeling that experience into the world of games. The characters on the screen are not just characters—they have thoughts, struggles, and their futures change based on your choices. Moments will arise that shake your heart or tighten your chest.</p><p>This live-action game, crafted by specialists in drama and film production, is not confined to a scripted story. Every choice creates new scenes, weaving a story that is uniquely yours.</p><p>Hiromitsu Kitayama, who played the central role in this project, not only possesses exceptional acting skills but is also widely supported as an artist across various entertainment fields. His presence and expressiveness enrich the world of the game, making him essential to the live-action experience.</p><p>The completed <em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a game, yet it is also a story that allows you to experience a chapter of life. The more your emotions are engaged, the more vividly the story comes alive. We hope you will play your own drama in this world.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/izanagigames-nippon-tv-and-ax-on-announce-full-scale-live-action-game-akiba-lost-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
