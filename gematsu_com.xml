As the forefront of cybernetic robotic technology, the M-Tech Corporation converted the derelict prison into a massive robotic research facility. Now a hotbed of experimental nanotechnology and human robot replica research pushed beyond ethical limits.</p><p>You awaken as M-07 a machine prototype with an unexplained anomaly at its core after a disastrous event awakens you. The entire complex is in lockdown and the automated defense systems have been activated. Search the facility, defeat the defense systems in place, recover your memories, and unravel the origin of your creation and the M-Tech Corporation.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s cold and sterile. Power is running low. Everything is a blur of fragmented commands and half-remembered routines.

The truth lingers just out of reach but something compels you to move forward and find out who, and what you are.</p><p><strong>Puzzles and Mechanics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Classic Controls</strong> – Navigate using fixed-camera angles and tank-style controls, evoking the feel of retro survival horror classics.</li><li><strong>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> – Begin defenseless with a limited power source.

Every upgrade is a double-edged sword, enhancing your capabilities while depleting your finite energy reserves.</li></ul><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Options</strong> – While the default experience celebrates retro visuals, customizable options let you dial back the nostalgia for a slightly modernized presentation.</li><li><strong>Inspirational Homage</strong> – Drawing artistic inspiration from the haunting ambiance of <em>Galerians</em>, the mysterious vibe of <em>BioForge</em>, the melancholic isolation of Amiga classics like <em>Citadel</em>, and the eerie aesthetics of the <em>Alien</em> films and <em>Alien Breed: Tower Assault</em>, every pixel and shadow is crafted to immerse you in an unsettling blend of futuristic decay and retro horror.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Ghost Sector - Trailer (Coming 2026)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0QXFl0NS8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Developed by Mighty Yell and 13AM Games. Due out in 2025.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Atari [181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a> and developers <a title="Companies > Mighty Yell [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mighty-yell">Mighty Yell</a> and <a title="Companies > 13AM Games [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/13am-games">13AM Games</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Missile Command Delta [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/missile-command-delta">Missile Command Delta</a></em>, a reimagining of Atari’s 1980s missile defense <a title="Genres > Arcade [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> classic as a turn-based tactical game, for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,056 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-950335"></span></p><p>“While <em>Missile Command Delta</em> approaches gameplay in a completely new way, it retains all the tension and suspense of the arcade original,” said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a press release. “You have to think strategically about every move you make because even one poor choice can have grave consequences.”</p><p>Stearns continued, “<em>Missile Command Delta</em> has a little something for every kind of player—whether you love strategy tactics games, are a mystery fan, a secret hunting completionist, or you just love to explore and solve puzzles. We can’t wait for players to get their hands on the game later this year.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><em>Missile Command Delta</em> reimagines Atari’s 1980s missile defense arcade classic as a turn-based tactical game set against a mysterious narrative that leaves you questioning whether you’re trapped in a simulation or truly defending cities from attack.</p><p>As players explore an abandoned half-century old facility they will encounter locked doors, dishevelled work rooms, massive super computers and newly awakened missile command terminals. Players must defend against waves of missiles from an unknown enemy using a battery of missiles, each with its own unique type, range, and explosion size. Only by managing their arsenal carefully will they have enough firepower to clear the skies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As enemy attacks increase and pressure mounts, relationships will be put to the test, blurring the lines between what is real and who they can trust. If they succeed, they may even learn the truth behind this Cold War defense program.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Missile Command Delta - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qj11h_CjmTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
