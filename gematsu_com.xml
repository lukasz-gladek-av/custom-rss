Development has been steadily progressing but an unforeseen circumstance outside our control arose, preventing us from continuing work and forced us to reassess our release schedule and make the necessary adjustments.</p><p>While our original target was a summer release, after careful consideration, we have decided to delay the game by a few months. This will give us the time needed to ensure that every aspect of the game, from the gameplay to the presentation, meets the quality we strive for and that fans deserve.</p><p>We understand it is disappointing to wait longer than expected, but we are confident this decision will lead to a stronger, more polished experience at launch. In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more details, new screenshots, additional information!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Please stay tuned for the upcoming release date trailer! Thank you again for your continued support and enthusiasm!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ys-vs-trails-in-the-sky-alternative-saga-delayed-by-a-few-months-in-the-west]]></content:encoded>
