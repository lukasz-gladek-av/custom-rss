It features one out of the three routes in the full game in its entirety. <span id="more-992711"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Genres > Roguelike [369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">Roguelike</a> x unknown discovery in the depths of a million underground floors.</p><p>“Embark on a roguelike journey into the depths of Earth, explore a million underground floors, and uncover the unknown.”</p><p>After Earth’s downfall, the protagonist “Moma” aims to explore the depths of a million underground layers. Being attacked by unique creatures and androids from the underground, Moma fights back using weapons she crafts along the way. Sometimes, the stunning views of the underground world steal her heart as she uncovers the mystery behind the downfall of underground humanity and the truth about “YOU.” Her quest for answers drives her to continue exploring the depths.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> and Battle</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Crafting System Where Your Drawings Transform into Weapons</strong> – To survive the harsh underground environment, you must craft weapons and armor depending on the circumstances. You can create your own weapons and armor by combining various parts. It’s up to you to decide whether to make them more powerful for attacking, easier to defend against enemy assaults, enhance mobility for quick movement, or go for a stylish look – it’s all up to your imagination!</li><li><strong>Combat System Where the World Stops When You Stop</strong> – By using the “Biotope Jammer” brought from space, Moma can freeze all movement around her while she remains still. It is essential to think carefully and adapt according to the situation.</li><li><strong>Unique Battles</strong> – In these battles, you can see the enemy’s attack power, and you can reduce their power by hitting them with your crafted weapons. However, when your crafted weapon hits the enemy, it starts to crumble. Once it surpasses a certain threshold, it enters an automatic recovery mode and becomes temporarily unusable. This leads to strategic battles where you have to figure out how to preserve your own weapons while dealing damage to the enemy.</li></ul><p><strong>Unique Storytelling Through Parallel Worlds</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Story that Changes with Every Replay</strong> – This game employs a “multi-ending” structure, branching based on encountered levels and specific conditions. Moreover, these endings can influence the next player’s gameplay (the past “Moma” in parallel worlds). With each playthrough, you’ll notice changes in the same NPCs (the androids) as well. With various parallel worlds, you can repeatedly enjoy the evolving story. Discover the ending that Moma desires the most!</li><li><strong>Discovery of the Unknown</strong> – In the underground, you’ll find numerous floors that make you wonder, “Why would something like this be underground?!” While enjoying short stories from those floors and learning about past humanity, players gradually piece together the puzzle of what befell past mankind. However, is that understanding truly accurate? Delve into the joy of unraveling a complex story woven across multiple parallel worlds!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Million Depth</em> is due out for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on November 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/million-depth-demo-now-available]]></content:encoded>
