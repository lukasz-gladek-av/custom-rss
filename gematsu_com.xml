    <p><span>More secrets of Sacrifice and the hidden history of New Eridu's military factions.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Among the Forgotten Ruins,” will launch on March 12, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-947453"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Commissioned by the Mayor of New Eridu, Proxies will vie against several factions including the phantom thief syndicate Mockingbird in an exclusive auction to seize a coveted artifact entwined with the Sacrifice’s secrets. Meanwhile, Anby’s true identity gradually emerges, and Trigger, the teammate of Solider 11, will reveal more about the history of New Eridu’s military factions. With new foes including Geppetto in Hollow Zero and varied in-game events, Proxies can expect an enriched and exciting adventure.</p><p>In this new chapter of the main story, Proxies are determined to secure an artifact related to Sacrifice in an auction that has ignited tensions among different factions. Amidst the intrigue, Hugo and Vivian appear to be deliberately drawing close to the Proxies, blurring the line between ally and adversary. Beyond the main narrative, players will also uncover Anby’s past before her involvement with the Cunning Hares and gain deeper insights into New Eridu’s military force.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_947454"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Anby Demara used to be known as Soldier 0 – Anby, the former leader of the Silver Squad. She is an S-Rank Electric Attack Agent, wielding dual swords to rapidly deal Electric damage. Her attack triggers Aftershock as well as amplifying the CRIT DMG of allies targeting the same enemy. Alongside Soldier 0 – Anby, the new S-Rank character Trigger, an Electric Stun Agent and ace sniper of the Obol Squad, will make her debut. When entering Sniper Mode, Trigger can swiftly evade enemy attacks, striking at the opportune moment while calling in teammates for a Quick Assist. Her attack accumulates Purge, enhancing Aftershock damage and increasing damage dealt by allies on the same target. In addition, our familiar friend Pulchra Fellini is making her return in Version 1.6 as an A-Rank Physical Stun Agent under the banner of the Sons of Calydon. In the meantime, S-Rank Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and S-Rank Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan will also make their return in the rerun banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In Version 1.6, players will get to confront the new boss Geppetto in Hollow Zero and unlock the newly introduced Difficulty VI in Battlefront Purge. Furthermore, players can experience the new Hollow Zero gameplay Shadow Operation, featuring unique effects in every battle stage, such as increasing damage based on accumulated coins. In Trigger’s TV Schedule, a new third-person shooter gameplay will be introduced, allowing players to take on sniper missions. Additionally, Proxies can complete challenges as a Bangboo drone in the March On, Tiny Titan! event or aid a Bangboo in completing 10 different trials in the Little Knight’s Big Charge event to obtain exclusive rewards, including the playable agent Pulchra.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,963 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,492 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.6 trailer and special program below.
