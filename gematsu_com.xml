      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,970 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> has established <a title="Companies > Dark Outlaw Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/dark-outlaw-games">Dark Outlaw Games</a>, a new studio led by Jason Blundell, the producer on <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, Campaign design director for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>, game director for the Campaign and Zombies modes of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>, and director and producer for the Career and Zombies modes in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII</em>. <span id="more-950562"></span></p><p>Blundell revealed the new studio’s establishment on the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank">Jeff Gerstmann’s Bonus Podcast</a>.</p><p>“I’ve had the amazing opportunity to create a new studio within <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,155 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios for Sony,” Blundell said. “The studio is called Dark Outlaw. And so Dark Outlaw Games have been working away in the shadows for a while, and when we’ve got something to talk about, we’ll step out into the light. But you know the story for me is about the game, not about the studio, so the reason why we’re not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, ‘let’s get something,’ right?”</p><p>Blundell continued, “And it’s such a privilege to be able to do it with with Sony as a new first-party studio. You know, Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. So to have to have that privilege is humbling—it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</p><p>As for how far along the studio’s first game is, Blundell remained tight-lipped.</p><p>“[We’re currently] staffing up, keeping it kind of lowkey—been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we’re doing exactly, but it’s like we talked about—getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right, let’s test those—you know, I’m a programmer at heart—so let’s test those assumptions, and you know, ‘is it working?'”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>He went on, “It’s very exciting and I love the fact still, at this point in my career, I’m given these opportunities. And it’s always that desire to want to put that one extra disc on the wall, if you will, and can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs or [something] exciting or dangerous. That makes me jump out of bed every morning.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Outwit the automated defenses, search for answers to your origin uncovering secrets, solving puzzles, and upgrade your abilities while preserving your finite energy.</p><p>Step into the research complex on planet RX-712, once maximum security prison has now transformed into an advanced research station when a discovery of valuable minerals is unearthed. As the forefront of cybernetic robotic technology, the M-Tech Corporation converted the derelict prison into a massive robotic research facility. Now a hotbed of experimental nanotechnology and human robot replica research pushed beyond ethical limits.</p><p>You awaken as M-07 a machine prototype with an unexplained anomaly at its core after a disastrous event awakens you. The entire complex is in lockdown and the automated defense systems have been activated. Search the facility, defeat the defense systems in place, recover your memories, and unravel the origin of your creation and the M-Tech Corporation.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s cold and sterile. Power is running low. Everything is a blur of fragmented commands and half-remembered routines. Something went wrong, the facility is on lock down. Break from confinement and search the complex for answers. The truth lingers just out of reach but something compels you to move forward and find out who, and what you are.</p><p><strong>Puzzles and Mechanics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Classic Controls</strong> – Navigate using fixed-camera angles and tank-style controls, evoking the feel of retro survival horror classics.</li><li><strong>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> – Begin defenseless with a limited power source. Scavenge for modules that upgrade your abilities—from a stronger power core and cybernetic shield to eventually arming you for combat.</li><li><strong>Strategic Encounters</strong> – Use your wits to solve intricate environmental puzzles while avoiding or outsmarting hostile defenses and lurking enemies. Every upgrade is a double-edged sword, enhancing your capabilities while depleting your finite energy reserves.</li></ul><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Options</strong> – While the default experience celebrates retro visuals, customizable options let you dial back the nostalgia for a slightly modernized presentation.</li><li><strong>Inspirational Homage</strong> – Drawing artistic inspiration from the haunting ambiance of <em>Galerians</em>, the mysterious vibe of <em>BioForge</em>, the melancholic isolation of Amiga classics like <em>Citadel</em>, and the eerie aesthetics of the <em>Alien</em> films and <em>Alien Breed: Tower Assault</em>, every pixel and shadow is crafted to immerse you in an unsettling blend of futuristic decay and retro horror.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Ghost Sector - Trailer (Coming 2026)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0QXFl0NS8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
