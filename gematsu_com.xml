What a ride it’s been.</p><p>With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, <em>Rock Band 4</em> will be removed from the PlayStation and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes—you’ll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to downloadable content: songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you’ve purchased will remain in your library.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We’re so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it’s been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep downloadable content library and a best in class band sim. If you’ve been meaning to grab a few last songs, now’s the time. Thanks again,</p><p>—The <em>Rock Band</em> Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/rock-band-4-to-be-delisted-on-october-5]]></content:encoded>
