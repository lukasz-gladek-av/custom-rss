The game is nearly complete, but a few parts of the adventure still need polishing. That’s why we’re inviting players to get an early taste of the journey through Early Access.</p><p>From day one, you’ll be able to dive into three biomes, each with unique enemies, and return with over  120 relics to sell in your shop. Set prices, serve customers, customize your space, and experience most of the story—all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
