        <p>A wide variety of newly added playable characters!</p><p>Supports online rankings and various achievements!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Control the character with an 8-way lever and two buttons (shot, bomb).</p><p><strong>Character Selection</strong></p><p>Players select one of several characters with different normal attacks, shikigami attacks, special attacks, and movement speeds.</p><p>You can also choose between the first and second types of attack, which have different performance for each character, allowing for a variety of attack methods.</p><p>You can also play with two players. (Supports remote play together! Challenge with shikigami users from around the world!)</p><p>Each character has their own backstory, and a story demo is inserted immediately after starting play and before and after the start of the stage.</p><p>In addition, when playing with two players, the story and scenario change depending on the combination of characters selected.</p><p><strong>Various Attacks</strong></p><p>There are three types of attacks: normal attacks, shikigami attacks, and special attacks.</p><ul><li><strong>Normal Attacks</strong> (Shots)<ul><li>A rapid-firing attack. Since it can attack a relatively wide area, you can ensure your own safety by focusing on this in battle.</li><li>Also, when the Tension Bonus System is at its maximum, it becomes a high tension attack, and the firing speed and power increase.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Shikigami Attack</strong><ul><li>In exchange for a slower movement speed during the attack, this attack automatically collects the coins that appear.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Special Attack</strong><ul><li>A so-called bomb.

The points you get with a normal attack increase, and the number of coins that appear increases even more with a Shikigami attack.</p><p><strong>High Tension MAX System</strong></p><p>Equipped with a new function that satisfies your insatiable passion for shooting games!</p><p>A system that consumes one special attack to activate. There is a short period of invincibility when activated. A red gauge will be displayed at the top edge of the screen for a certain period of time, and until it runs out, “T.B.S. judgment will always be 8 times (≒ always in a high-tension shot state)” and “the amount of coins appearing will be 1.5 times.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Steam Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam &quot;Castle of Shikigami 3&quot; Promotional Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEMzQQ8jE0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam『式神の城Ⅲ』プロモーションビデオ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWQEGhsXoPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
