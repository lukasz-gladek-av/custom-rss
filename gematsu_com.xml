    <p><span>From Ether One and The Occupation developer White Paper Games.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>Ether One</em>, <em>The Occupation</em>, and <em>Dahlia View</em> developer <a title="Companies > White Paper Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/white-paper-games">White Paper Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > I AM RIPPER" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/i-am-ripper">I AM RIPPER</a></em>, a British thriller set in the brutality and economic decline of the 1980s. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218100/I_AM_RIPPER/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/i-am-ripper-031b47" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-962952"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via White Paper Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Step into the world of Ripper.</p><p>It’s 1988, a small north-western dock town in Britain has witnessed multiple victims by a single killer who have been confirmed through forensic analysis.</p><p>Throughout the game, you will be faced with critical decisions which will change the outcome of your investigation.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You must confront a series of gut-wrenching challenges placing the fates of others in your hands.</p><p>Find the forensics, reveal the secrets and pursue the person responsible.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Branching narratives Players will be forced to confront choices that’ll ripple through their timelines and change story outcomes in distinct ways.</li><li>Tactile gameplay We love to create gameplay mechanics with high interactivity and this game will be no different. You can see an example of our tactility taken to a new level with the stitch-cutting sequence on our announce trailer.</li><li>Award winning storytelling <em>I AM RIPPER</em> is a fast paced thriller told from multiple perspectives. White Paper Games is known for its performances, storytelling and world building and this game will build upon these traits.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_962958"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Message from White Paper Games</strong></p><p>Each White Paper game we design is a reaction to our past work. To know this game, it’s useful to know how <em>Ether One</em>, <em>The Occupation</em>, and <em>Dahlia View</em> were brought to life.</p><p><em>Ether One</em> (2014) was an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> through the brain exploring what it’s like to live with dementia and the fragility of our core memories. The experience was deeply meaningful to us and taught us that we don’t need to be explicit with story. Instead, respect player input and they’ll place the pieces in order. In <em>The Occupation</em> (2019), the emergence of headlines, and not knowing what was true, whilst also being constrained by the ticking clock, forced the player to make choices about paths they were uncertain about. <em>Dahlia View</em> (2021) brought us a tragedy of how a missing child can impact a community of people and how to weave incredible characters into a thrilling experience. </p><p>The Ripper will create horrific circumstances forcing you to choose a path. The path will have consequences for someone, you just don’t know who. You have to figure out where your moral judgments lay. Power is all around us and how power is used relates to the scenario you’re placed in. </p><p>The thriller genre is underserved. We have media on TV, in movies, documentaries and podcasts, but we have few game examples. We want <em>I AM RIPPER</em> to cater to all those people who love gritty thrillers, but don’t have an interactive way of exploring the themes, situations and challenges in a non-linear way. </p><p><em>I AM RIPPER</em> builds upon everything we’ve learnt about story delivery, tactile gameplay and meaningful consequence. It’s not a puzzle game, or a horror game, or a detective game, but it has all the key components of those genres to create something that feels rewarding, explorative of core themes and characters that feel real and grounded in their world.</p><p>We hope you resonate with our work and we’d love to chat to you more about our game if you have questions.</p><p>Thank you for your time,<br>White Paper Games</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
