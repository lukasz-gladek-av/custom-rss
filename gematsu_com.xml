It bills itself as a unique stealth-lite meets action platformer experience, with a hint of brutal combat and deep levels of exploration.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Originally conceived based on a comic book from the development studio and then Kickstarted soon after, <em>SteamDolls</em> has been a passion project of its director. The game features a beautiful comic book inspired 2D-meets-3D aesthetic, with a spattering of unique, fully voiced cinematic cutscenes. It boasts a large world to explore split across unique zones, such as a beautiful yet far overgrown chapel, a hellish underbelly seemingly made of flesh, an electrified industrial bunker, a city overrun by an insect-like infection, and more! Put the treasure found during your explorations to good usage back in your home base by upgrading The Whisper and his skills to better suit your gameplay style, unlocking unique lore and cutscenes, and putting your finest trophies on display.</p><p>Of course, the title has more to offer than just its AAA voice work and beautiful art. In-game, you’ll find yourself entrenched in the utter brutality of a labyrinthine city gone mad. Sleuth through the shadows of the world and lose yourself in every nook and cranny of this city—and the blood of its inhabitants. Taking the role of The Whisper (David Hayter), you’ll have to balance stealth and brutality to make your goals into reality.
