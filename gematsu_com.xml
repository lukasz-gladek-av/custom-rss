In this charming fusion of fantasy adventure, not all heroes wield swords… Some prefer the spoon. And, sometimes to save the world you’ve got to start with a really good meal.</p><p>Palo Pori is a beautiful and peaceful village of artisans and tastemakers. Beyond the village’s protective wall, darkness has begun to stir. Ravenous monsters have claimed the land and threaten to sink their teeth into this final morsel of hope and happiness.</p><p>Play as Panko, a young, talented chef, helping to run the local eatery. When Panko’s teacher goes missing, a mysterious visitor arrives with warnings of the dangers beyond the wall. It’s up to Panko to step up and take over the restaurant and tend to the ingredients and patrons. But that’s not all, Panko also finds himself serving the Caretakers, brave adventurers, sent to save the world. In this adventure, preserving peace starts in the kitchen!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>From Town to Table</strong></p><p>In Palo Pori, fresh is best! Gather ingredients and resources, care for animals and grow your own fruit and veg to build up your very own cozy town to table restaurant. Forage for wild herbs and unlock new seeds to grow to expand your meals.</p><p><strong>Serving Your Community</strong></p><p>Chop, flip, and sizzle your way through mouthwatering mini-games as you whip up delightful dishes for the townsfolk. Good food is always better with company, so work hard to improve your <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> and experiment with ingredients, to keep your patrons happy.</p><p>Tailor your restaurant to the tastes of your community, develop new meals, progress your know how through a skill tree and adjust the decor to increase your restaurant’s appeal.</p><p><strong>Feed the Caretakers</strong></p><p>You’ll also need to feed the hungry Caretakers; these brave denizens of the land will venture out into the wilds to fight the ravenous monsters threatening the peace of Palo Pori. Each Caretaker hails from their own flavour region, affecting their own tastes and preferences: some like it bitter, some like it sweet and some are just looking to fulfil their craving of the day! Craft thoughtful meals and balance the flavour profiles to boost their spirits, sharpen their skills, and unlock new abilities. Because let’s face it… Who can save the world on an empty stomach?</p><p><strong>Delicious Deck Building</strong></p><p>Now it’s time to put your meal to the test! This is where taste meets tactics. The dishes you serve will build your Caretaker’s deck – each ingredient unlocking a card. And once they’ve eaten, they’ll venture into the wilds to fight the monsters. Upon their return, they’ll recount their journey and play out their battles through a charming puppet theatre sequence. They might even bring you back some MONSTEROUS ingredients from their ventures. Fight the monsters in turn-based deck building combat, inspired by traditional trick-taking card games. Outplay the monsters, by matching their flavour magic or neutralising it with a balancing card. Add an enhancing card to power up your moves! Your magic can turn the tables!</p><p>Utilize the unique effects of your ingredients to put your enemies to sleep, blow away their cards, and more, but watch out, you’re not the only one with special abilities. If you’re not paying attention, you might get burned.</p><p>In this food-based fantasy adventure, it’s time to give peas a chance! – Are you ready to get cooking?</p><p>Unlock the magic in food.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/culinary-fantasy-adventure-game-beastro-announced-for-xbox-series-pc]]></content:encoded>

As the most benevolent leader of your island nation, guide your loyal citizens (and your Swiss Bank Account) through the ages toward untold prosperity. Remember: Control isn’t tyranny, it’s efficiency – and more control means more efficiency (except when Penultimo is involved, but that’s another story).</p><p>Exert your control and shape the landscape you are building on to fit your vision. Plan and construct complex city layouts, fulfil the multifaceted needs of your subjects, give precise directions to your army, and look down on your opponents in the council, all while revelling in your own splendor. See how it all leads to ever greater efficiency? This could be an aspiring dictator’s dream come true indeed… however, sometimes life gives you lemons. Or obstacles in the shape of a very clever and very annoying opponent: Victoria Guerra! You will need all your skills, cunning and presidential ‘grandeur’ to end this latest chapter with a simple truth: ¡Victoria no es la revolucion!</p><!-- AD: content -->
