            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > SEGA [2,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">SEGA</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Two Point Studios [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega/two-point-studios">Two Point Studios</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Two Point Museum [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a></em> downloadable content “Fantasy Finds.” It will launch on July 17. <span id="more-976285"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the content, via SEGA:</p><blockquote><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> will venture deep into the world of medieval fantasy with “Fantasy Finds,” its first downloadable content release.</p><p>“Fantasy Finds” offers museum curators a new exclusive fantasy expedition map to explore with an enormous treasure trove of 40 exhibits to discover, such as the Teanie Kettle, Novel Wardrobe and Flying Carpet. These magical artefacts aren’t just for show either, as they will provide positive blessings for guests when well maintained… but watch out, those who don’t look after these intriguing curios will find they curse guests instead!</p><p>To discover these new magical exhibits on your expeditions, you’ll need to hire Fantasy Experts from Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue or Bard classes, each of whom possess their own stats. Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack? Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut. Whatever the obstacle, “Fantasy Finds” will challenge you to hire a varied party of fantasy experts with their own strengths and talents to ensure you successfully return home from expeditions with new magical exhibits.</p><p>That’s not all, as “Fantasy Finds” will also weave its fantasy magic throughout your museum with three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors and you’ll even see your expedition helicopter joining in the fun, thanks to a fresh paint job ensuring it fits the medieval fantasy mood. You can even buff your museum staff with Mythical Gear exhibits which can be equipped or put on display, providing bonuses such as protection on nearby exhibits or even job security to fend off being fired.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
