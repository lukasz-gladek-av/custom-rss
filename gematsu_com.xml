Death provides no escape, as his jailors will keep reviving him until he serves every last second. But one way out does exist: win on Cable Galactica’s hottest game show, “The Last Ticket.”</p><p>Starting off with just melee attacks, brutalize waves of foes with kicks and punches, eventually earning ranged weapons like simple pistols up to assault rifles and futuristic firearms that can pack a punch from a distance. Roll to dodge attacks, or use carefully-timed blocks to deflect enemy attacks, just don’t run out of energy.</p><p>The Last Ticket’s grotesque host Volkov may be a monster, but he likes entertainment, so Morgan has access to cybernetic implants that increase the strength of his melee attacks, enable literally bone-crushing combos, and enable the usage of giant sledgehammers. What’s a cybernetic upgrade without the ability to unleash special powers like rocket-propelled dash punches and electric shockwaves?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Reviving Morgan after each run will prove to be Volkov’s gravest mistake, as the currency earned each run can go toward permanent unlocks, giving Morgan more and more advantages as he seeks freedom, no matter what it may cost him along the way.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="KIBORG - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yk-nwn4YLYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The title features grand, beautiful visual depictions made possible by the RE ENGINE, Capcom’s proprietary game development engine, and crossplay, allowing players to enjoy the game together regardless of their game platform.</p><p>The title provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation®5 system, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and PC. Additionally, the introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems have provided an even more immersive gaming experience, while the fusion of numerous new elements with <em>Monster Hunter</em>‘s appeal has generated significant excitement, all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10 million units sold. Additionally, the first free Title Update is scheduled for April 4th, which will add a fan-favorite monster as well as the Grand Hub, a new in-game settlement where players can gather and communicate with each other. Going forward, Capcom plans to continue to release updates that will delight players, such as the second Title Update which is scheduled for release in the summer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
