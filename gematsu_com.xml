As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</p><p>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</p><p>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we’re taking on the path ahead.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/microsoft-gaming-closes-the-initiative-cancels-perfect-dark-amid-mass-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

Battle through tainted creatures, meet charismatic musicians and uncover the truth behind the curse that robbed the land of all color.</p><p>Many have tried to venture inside the twisted depths of Talos, a dormant fortress where several civilizations have settle over centuries. And, after losing everything she held dear, Europa has nothing holding her back from attempting what others could not achieve. As a noble fighter who refuses to be bound by the curse, she must enter the castle, find the source of corruption, and return the color once and for all.</p><p>This <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> is not for Europa to face alone. Inside the giant, she befriends Apino, a cute floating bear who seems to possess magical abilities that can restore color and replenish the health of his allies. He is also able to shield his companions from the multiple dangers that roam Talos’ hallways.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>While exploring the castle, Apino can cleanse the corruption around Talos and shoot a variety of projectiles that can destroy dark crystals and inflict damage:</p><ul><li>A fist that punches upwards when conjured.</li><li>A blast that travels along a surface until collision.</li><li>A cyclone that returns to Apino like a boomerang.</li></ul><p>Use the elements to your advantage to travel the map dynamically. <a title="Companies > ACQUIRE [344 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kadokawa-corporation/acquire">Acquire</a> the elemental armors that were once treasures to ancient civilizations and change on the fly and unlock special abilities to traverse your way: from swimming against waterfalls to traveling underground tunnels or gliding through warm air currents.</p><p>Harness the power of lightning, water, earth, and fire. Surprise bosses while you switch armors, perform strong halberd combos, and exploit your foes’ weaknesses to pave your way through the heart of the shadows.</p><p>Music is all but the soul of the game. <a title="Games > Revita [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/revita">Revita</a>lize the world while you listen to a moving soundtrack composed by Miguel Hasson, as well as soothing pieces scored in 432hz by celebrated composers Michiru Yamane (<em>Castlevania</em> series) and Norihiko Hibino (<em><a title="Platforms > Meta [147 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l Gear Solid</em> series).
