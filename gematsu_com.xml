The game itself is part of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sixmorevodka/orken" target="_blank">larger fictional universe</a> created by Marko Djurdjevic, but the game is being designed as a standalone experience.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4146090/Orken/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The final dream is upon us all.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After his best friend goes missing, the young Khar warrior Coltec must assemble a pack of allies and venture into unknown territory in pursuit of the kidnappers. Along the way, they begin to unravel the terrible fate that will soon befall their homeland, Edom. With his warhammer, Vikari’s Bite, in hand, and the support of his Totem to lend him powerful abilities in combat, Coltec has no choice but to fight for his friend, and his <a title="Genres > Survival [501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Orken</em> is an <a title="Genres > Action [3,323 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,812 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> in the vein of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma</em>, blending stunning visuals drawn directly from the artwork of SIXMOREVODKA with tight, stamina-based combat.</p><p>Fight the unknown foes using tightly-focused, Soulslike combat, based around the use of special, cooldown-limited abilities to augment basic strikes. Avoid enemy attacks using quick dodges, and manage your stamina-bar, in order to line up your own counterattacks. A poise meter builds up with each hit on an enemy, eventually leaving them staggered and vulnerable, before allowing an execution at low health!</p><p><strong>Choose Your Path</strong></p><p>Gain experience through combat and exploration and level-up to unlock new tiers on Coltec’s “Atman,” a Totem pole representing his soul’s attunement to the Spirit World. By rotating each tier, new abilities can activated or deactivated, revealing special combinations when abilities are aligned with each other, amplifying some effects and nullifying others.</p><p>Guide Coltec’s journey through dialogue choices and pivotal story moments, directing his fate towards its inevitable conclusion. Characters react to your actions, allowing Coltec to gain and lose favor with others, influencing the options available to you in future moments. Pick your allies carefully, and watch your enemies closely.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ORKEN: ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pev0l5OJopA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/orcs-vs-humans-action-rpg-orken-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
