Once, it was the pride of the town and one of the most respected and desired schools in the region. Until the day Sachiko Shinozaki died, cursing the grounds forever more. Now Heavenly Host Elementary exists in a plane beyond the mortal realm, and where once it was a place of optimism and joy, now there is nothing but tragedy, ruin, and horror.</p><p>From its origins retold in <em>Corpse Party</em> (2021), where a friendship ritual gone wrong springs terror on a new generation of students, to a deeper exploration of the pain and suffering of generations of students in <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, with a special detour to an invite-only birthday party from hell in <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em>, and the chilling conclusion of the saga in <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em>, you’ll uncover every last truth held within the walls of Heavenly Host Elementary… if you survive.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fifteen years after reintroducing fans on consoles to Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragically cursed school haunted by the pain of the past, the <em>Corpse Party</em> series returns with a brand-new collection of the iconic saga that made its bloody mark on fans around the world. Available exclusively on <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,578 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, the <em>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</em> bundles four nightmarish narratives united by this keystone of creepiness. Go back to where this haunting adventure began in the modernized original <em>Corpse Party</em> (2021) and its twisted sequel <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, then experience the devilishly fun <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em>, never-before-released on consoles in the west. If you manage to survive all that, the stunning conclusion of the “Heavenly Host” arc awaits in <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em>!</p><p>Whether you’re new to the <em>Corpse Party</em> franchise, or a seasoned veteran of Sachiko’s blood-curdling frights, this collection is a celebration of what makes this series so memorable and shouldn’t be missed.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four Terrifying Tales, One Complete Package</strong> – Play through the entirety of the “Heavenly Host” saga and experience four terrifying tales of intertwined fates in one convenient package.</li><li><strong>Extreme Japanese <a title="Genres > Horror [695 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a></strong> – Explore the halls of Heavenly Host Elementary in a riveting mystery full of vengeful spirits, psychological horrors, and shocking secrets. The <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> storytelling unfolds in the original Japanese voiceover with English subtitles.</li><li><strong>New for Nintendo Switch</strong> – <em>Book of Shadows</em> and <em>Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em> will both be available on Nintendo Switch for the first time!</li><li><strong>High-Definition Scares</strong> – Each title has been optimized for high-definition audio and video, making this collection great for first-time players, and a startling new way to play for longtime fans.</li></ul><p><strong>Included Games</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>Corpse Party</em></strong> (2021) – A friendship ritual gone awry transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality version of a tragedy-stricken institution that stood on the site of their own school long ago. As the vengeful spirits of elementary school students threaten their lives and their sanity, their only hope of <a title="Genres > Survival [451 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>–much less escape–is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em></strong> – An anthology series that serves as a <em>Corpse Party</em> sequel, prequel, midquel, and alternate universe tale all in one. <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em> builds upon the events of the first game, exploring or re-exploring past incidents, characters, and points of view, and allowing the player to escape many of the deaths that occurred previously, thus steering them toward all-new (albeit not necessarily better) outcomes.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em></strong> – A (surprisingly) canonical “midquel” to <em>Corpse Party</em> and <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, taking place sometime during the course of those games, <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em> recounts the bizarre events of vengeful ghost girl Sachiko Shinozaki’s one-of-a-kind birthday party held in the otherworldly school where so many lives have been lost in previous games: Heavenly Host Elementary. Surviving to the end will require thinking like Sachiko and making the choices that will please her the most…but with the fewest casualties.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em></strong> – Set two months after <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em> is the definitive conclusion to the long-running Heavenly Host story arc. Featuring dynamic lighting, detailed environments, and new gameplay systems, this is a Japanese horror experience not to be missed!</li></ul></blockquote><p>View a set of screenshots and box art <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/corpse-party-tetralogy-pack/august-25-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_987759"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/corpse-party-tetralogy-pack-coming-west-in-2025]]></content:encoded>
