        </p>Game Creator<figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Founder of “Shirosawa Games.” His debut title was a major hit, earning him the reputation of a “genius creator,” but his later works failed to replicate that success.</p><p>He has two younger sisters; the youngest, Ruri, was one of the six girls who vanished in Akihabara 13 years ago in an unsolved case known as the “Akiba Disappearance.”</p><p>Struggling with stagnation in his daily life, he declares that he will make a comeback by creating a game based on the very incident that took his sister away. Its title: <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“Not only am I becoming a character in a game this time, but working alongside IzanagiGames and professionals from the gaming industry itself has been a real challenge for me. I’m truly delighted that what we’ve created together as a team can cross borders and reach people all over the world.</p><p>“Also, by facing this project together with such talented cast members from various fields, I feel the game has gained depth and even sparked a kind of chemistry. It’s an unknown challenge, but as I imagine people around the world picking up and enjoying this game, I know I’ll want to grab a controller myself.”</p><p><strong>◆ Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura)<br>Maid</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid cafe in Akihabara.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident.</p><p>While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Sayuri Matsumura, and I play the maid in <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>“I’m thrilled that my long-time dream of becoming a ‘resident of the 2D world’ in the anime and game universe I love has finally come true. From Akihabara, we’re bringing the culture that Japan is proud of to the world.</p><p>“We did a lot of shooting. A LOT.</p><p>“The unique filming method used for games was completely new to me, and it revealed connections and hidden hints in the story that you can’t fully grasp from the script alone. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone enjoy discovering them while playing.</p><p>“Each cast member has a carefully crafted story, which is truly impressive.</p><p>“I hope everyone dives deep into the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>!”</p><p><strong>◆ Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe)<br>Game Streamer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games.</p><p>A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers.</p><p>His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“It was such an honor to play a character in a game for the first time! In dramas and films, audiences usually enjoy witnessing our characters’ lives, but in this game, becoming the protagonist and ‘choosing’ the story yourself is such a fresh experience.</p><p>“There are cinematic scenes, but many are depicted in still images, so for me—someone used to acting in full-motion video—the challenge was to convey a real, lifelike sense of presence so players can truly enjoy the game.</p><p>“In life, we make many ‘choices’—big decisions as well as small, everyday ones. I hope players enjoy the world they encounter when they experience these choices through the story.”</p><p><strong>◆ Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)<br>Gourmet Writer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food.</p><p>Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafes and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I grew up playing games like <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em>Zelda</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> without even realizing it, and I take pride in everything I’ve learned from them. That’s why it’s such an honor to actually be part of a game myself.</p><p>“My character, Moe Kurosu, is outwardly a playful, big-eating older sister, but she is also a tough, strong-willed adult woman. Portraying this duality was a challenge on set.</p><p>“While I was initially unsure about the unique filming style used for games, I had so much fun collaborating with the staff to bring the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to life. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Kokone Nagato</strong> (portayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48)<br>Underground Idol</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched. She switches clearly between on- and off-stage life, often wearing high-end brand clothes and accessories outside of performances.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m truly honored to be part of this project, which crosses the boundaries of games and television!</p><p>“<a title="Series > Persona [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I’ve always felt the importance of embracing new challenges as the times change, so I’m excited and thrilled to be able to explore a new area of entertainment as a performer.</p><p>“With that in mind, the cast and staff worked together wholeheartedly during filming.</p><p>“I hope everyone can experience this fresh, unique form of entertainment through the game.”</p><p><strong>◆ Chihiro Jimbo</strong> (portrayed by Azusa Ohara)<br>Shrine Maiden</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A shrine maiden working part-time at Kanda Myojin, the guardian deity of Akihabara.</p><p>After an event in her childhood, she came to believe in the existence of gods and developed a deep gratitude for the city of Akihabara. She is also an avid gamer and easily clears even difficult <a title="Genres > Action [3,043 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. Calm and gentle, her catchphrase is “Kami desu…” (“It’s divine…”).</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Azusa Ohara, playing Chihiro Jimbo.</p><p>“As someone who has always loved watching game streams, I was genuinely thrilled when I was offered this role.</p><p>“I never imagined that I, who had always been a viewer, would become part of the game myself. It was a new challenge for both me and the staff, and I remember spending many days experimenting on set.</p><p>“I feel truly honored to be part of this project and I’m excited to see how it will reach everyone. I hope many people will enjoy it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Wakana Yusa</strong> (portrayed by MINA of East Of Eden)<br>Cosplayer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_026.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A cosplayer based in Akihabara. She has dedicated over ten years to cosplaying Ririka from the legendary game Magical <a title="Companies > Elementa [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>ry Student Ririka, fully embodying her love for the character. As a returnee from overseas, she is fluent in English and interacts easily with foreign tourists. Her cheerful personality and excellent communication skills keep her going full speed along the “Ririka cosplay path.”</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m so happy to be part of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>, which is full of new ideas and challenges!</p><p>“I usually perform as a bassist or in a band, so this was my first time appearing in a game—a completely new challenge.</p><p>“Everything was new to me: acting, reading the schedule, and even the terminology. I learned every day from the cast and staff.</p><p>“But the filming was incredibly fun, and I’m glad I jumped in.</p><p>“As a bassist, I never imagined I’d have such a wonderful opportunity to take on a new challenge—what a surprise! I’m truly grateful!!!”</p><p><strong>■ Seven Main Cast Members to Gather on Stage at Tokyo Game Show Business Day—Live Streaming on YouTube</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_030.jpg"></a></figure><p>On September 25 from 13:00 to 14:00 JST, seven main cast members—Hiromitsu Kitayama, Sayuri Matsumura, Momoko Tanabe, Misato Ugaki, Yui Oguri (AKB48), Azusa Ohara, and MINA (East Of Eden)—will appear on the Main Stage at the Tokyo Game Show Business Day, held at Makuhari Messe.</p><p>Please note that this is a business day event, so general admission is not available.
