He posthumously left behind over a hundred journals detailing his adventures.</p><p>It is said that at age 17, he departed Esteria, the site of his first adventure, to journey to Celceta. However, The Normans’ Paradise Lost, one of the volumes found in his birth home, reveals that he made a stop in Obelia Gulf with his companion, the ex-thief Dogi, along the way.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Karja Balta</strong> (voiced by Lynn)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 17 years old</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_006.png"></a></figure><p>The only daughter of the Balta Seaforce’s jarl, Grimson.</p><p>She unabashedly leads a crew of marauders to carry out the Seaforce’s piratical activities. The sight of such acts strikes fear into the residents of Carnac, who refer to her as the Pirate Princess.</p><p>While she may look refined at a glance, she fights as ruthlessly and brutally as any Norman, axe and shield in hand.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Canute Gamley</strong> (voiced by Daiki Hamano)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 20 years old</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_009.png"></a></figure><p>A Norman native to the Kingdom of Danmorc, dauntless in appearance, but always languid and hard to pin down.</p><p>He is a first-class warrior known as “Canute the <a title="Games > Bloodshed [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>der.” The son of <a title="Companies > Sven" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sven">Sven</a>—the ruler of Danmorc who led the assault on the seven kingdoms of Britai—he once fought alongside his cousin Karja during the Britai Expedition.</p><p>A capable tactician as well, he has saved the outnumbered Norman forces from dire straits using strategies of his own design. For some reason, though, Karja feels uneasy around him.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Astrid Zayren</strong> (voiced by Coco Hayashi)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 20 years old</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_012.png"></a></figure><p>A Norman woman who serves as Canute’s “Shield Sister” and adjutant.</p><p>She cannot use mana, but she is quick on her feet and excels at logistical support on the battlefield.</p><p>With a bright, easygoing personality, she converses freely with Adol and Karja, but tends to be curt with Canute, perhaps because she is often bothered by his behavior.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Keywords</strong></p><p><strong>Aland Island</strong></p><p>A large island located in the northern part of Obelia Gulf, but not one easy to make landfall on due to the steep cliffs surrounding it.</p><p>Because it is an unexplored location, it is home to many nesting areas for migratory birds and other creatures, and is the site where one of the arks from the final days of the Norgard Duchy washed ashore.</p><p>Grimson, leader of the Balta Seaforce, once surveyed the island as a potential home base, but detailed information about the island remains unknown even today.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kingdom of Danmorc</strong></p><p>A kingdom of Normans in the northern part of the Eresia continent, facing the Northern Sea. It is the largest stronghold of the Norman people, and maintains hostile relations with the Romun Empire and Britai.</p><p>The Balta Seaforce is a branch of the Kingdom of Danmorc, bound to it by a mutual non-aggression pact. In the event that the Balta Seaforce is unable to govern the Obelia Gulf, control will be relinquished to the Kingdom of Danmorc.</p><p><strong>■ New Elements</strong></p><p><strong>A New Story Set on Danmorc Island</strong></p><p>Adol and Karja continue their exploration of Obelia Gulf aboard the sailing vessel Sandras in order to subjugate the undying creatures known as Griegr.</p><p>During their journey, they set out to explore Aland Island, the largest in Obelia Gulf, where they encounter the “Shield Siblings,” Canute and Astrid, from the Kingdom of Danmorc.</p><p>Why have the Normans—who are supposedly bound by a non-aggression pact with the Balta Seaforce—appeared in Obelia Gulf now? And what lies hidden on this island, once surveyed by Balta Seaforce leader Grimson?</p><p>The story of the Normans, and their pursuit of the origin of the mysterious power known as “mana,” unfolds through two pairs of Shield Siblings.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Mana Action: Mana Hold</strong></p><p>A special action that uses the power of mana to lift certain objects, or to launch them at a targeted location. It is a key element in dungeon exploration, whether it is using mechanic-based objects in combat or creating footholds to open up new paths.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Mana Ride Races</strong></p><p>Using Mana Ride—a mana action that lets you glide across land and water—you can take on traversal challenges across Aland Island’s natural terrain. Defeat your rivals, and you might even earn some special items…</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Bergen Arena</strong></p><p>At Bergen Arena on Aland Island, you can take on Norman-style training. (Solo play with either Adol or Karja is also available.) The opponents you will face are all formidable, but victory may yield luxurious rewards.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_023.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Muspelheim Shrine</strong></p><p>By meeting certain conditions, you will be able to take on the large dungeon known as Muspelheim Shrine. With limited time to act, various mechanics, and formidable foes awaiting, it is an extremely difficult dungeon, but by using rare items called “Deepcrystals,” you can lift some of the shrine’s restrictions (such as extending action time, altering enemy abilities, and more).</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_024.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_025.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Golden Symbols / Sea Breezes</strong></p><p>While exploring aboard the sailing vessel Sandras, a “Golden Symbol” may sometimes appear at sea. Entering one will trigger a naval battle, and achieving victory will unlock a new “Sea Breeze.” (Riding a Sea Breeze greatly increases the Sandras’ sailing speed.)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_026.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ys-X-Proud-Nordics_2025_04-14-25_027.jpg"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
