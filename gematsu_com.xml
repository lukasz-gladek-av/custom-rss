Now, 27 years later, history repeats itself with <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em>. With its tight level design, three selectable ships, powerful Delta Attacks, and the brilliant Force mechanic, this new edition proves that gaming classics of this caliber are truly timeless. If you played <em>R-Type Delta</em> back in the day, this is the perfect opportunity to return to its dark science fiction <a title="Genres > Action [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>. If you’ve never experienced this essential piece of gaming history before, now is the time.</p><p><strong>Sharper Than Ever</strong></p><p><em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> masterpiece until they’re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven’t experienced <em>R-Type Delta</em> until you’ve played it in high definition! Of course, the game also comes equipped with modern quality-of-life improvements.</p><p><strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong></p><p>What has always made <em>R-Type Delta</em> so fantastic is its dark, eerie atmosphere. Shoot-’em-ups are not typically known for storytelling, but <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> excels with its simple, minimalist environmental storytelling, characteristic of the late ’90s. It’s a narrative that is as fascinating as it is unsettling, as adrenaline-pumping as it is deeply disturbing. And all this without a single word being spoken.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Delta</strong></p><p>The name “Delta” carries several meanings. Firstly, the Greek letter delta resembles a triangle, which coincidentally has as many sides as there are playable ships in the game. It is also the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, and <em>R-Type Delta</em> is the fourth game in the <em>R-Type</em> series. Additionally, the delta triangle is the simplest type of polygon, which is fitting since <em>R-Type Delta</em> was the first game in the series to use three-dimensional polygon graphics instead of two-dimensional <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is <em>R-Type Delta</em>!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
