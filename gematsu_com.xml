Are you really… you?</p><p>A few years after the events in the first Urban Legend Hunters, the disappearance of a popular internet show host and influencer Chris became a hot topic on the internet. You, an outsider clueless about the incident, meet Rain, Shou, and Tangtang, who claim to be members of Chris’ channel, on a messaging app. They suspect that Chris’ disappearance has to do with the urban legend of the “double”, as well as the Urban Legend Hunters community. They ask you to join in their search for Chris, and the more you investigate and the more clues you gather, the closer you get to seeing the full picture of what really happened…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Cutscenes with real actors paired with virtual landscapes combine the real and unreal to transport you to a mysterious and unsettling alternate dimension.</li><li>Text messages and voice calls that create an immersive game experience.</li><li>Unique exploration mechanics that make you feel you’re really there in the alternate dimensions.</li><li>A rich story filled with suspense and intrigue.</li><li>A wide variety of puzzles waiting to be solved.</li><li>Builds on the series tradition of Urban Legend Hunters and expands on the “modern culture-bound syndrome” phenomenon.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Urban Legend Hunters 2: Double - New Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ScgmBA8x5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="分身: 都市伝説チャンネル奇話 | 新PV公開！ 今冬発売予定で鋭意開発進行中！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaNkvh8UoFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="都市傳說冒險團2：分身 | 新PV現已公布！計劃於今冬發售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QBdOZntUFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="都市传说冒险团2 ：分身 | 新PV现已公布！计划于今冬发售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DonTS8NJkjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing – spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!

        <p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>The game takes place in the near future, where warped monsters and ghouls have appeared from nowhere, swarming cities and forcing humans to battle against these creatures they’ve termed “demons” in an all-out Demon War. After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>In this exploration-heavy 2D action game, you will use your demon blade to interfere with the past, create new platforms, and shield yourself from danger to explore a desolate world.</p><p>Other than the Lumina Sword, you will also have access to other weapons such as swift daggers and long-range guns. Find the perfect weapons to suit your fighting style.</p><p>Upon leveling up, you will receive points that can be spent on unlocking skills that will aid you on your journey.</p><p>The whole game is depicted in Team Ladybug’s critically acclaimed gorgeously animated pixel art, in which each and every frame is painstakingly detailed.

It is a two-player game played on two devices. Although it is a <a title="Genres > Co-Op [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>, what you see on the screens of both players is completely different.</p><p>For example, although they should be looking at the same person, to one it looks like a storybook animal character, while to the other it looks like a robot. (The difference in perception causes the objects on the field to work differently in each world.) Players share what only they can see with their partner through conversation. They continue their journey by cooperating to solve riddles and puzzles. Players can also play online while talking to each other at a distance.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The basic game system is a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> puzzle adventure with a two-player cooperative element. During the course of the story, players are faced with a number of critical choices. Depending on the choices made, the story will unfold in several different ways.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Two boys who ran away from home discover a “dead deer” on their journey.</p><p>Seeing it, they faint and everything they see in each other’s eyes becomes different.</p><p>One is the world of animals, the other is the world of machines. The boys must unravel the mystery that happened to them.</p><p>Can they return to their original world?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>The main difference between this game and other games is that you need a partner to play with.</li><li>You cannot play this game alone or against the computer (CPU).</li><li>Two players are always required.</li><li>In other words, this game starts by deciding “Who will you play with?” The game starts with the decision of “who to play with.”</li><li>The total playing time is about three to four hours. During that time, the two players discuss with each other and reconcile their perceptions, solve problems, and make critical decisions</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;BOKURA&quot; PS5/PS4 Release Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/853b-HiuusU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『違う冬のぼくら』PS5/PS4 リリース告知トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh29qagYthU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《不同的冬天》PS5/PS4 版本发布公告" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn9u55DULcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game design and gradually UI change in reflection of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s.</p><p>The steampunk-style artwork and the character animations were all handled by a single animator.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>“Nice to meet you… again?”</em></p><p>An android named “Eve” speaks to “you,” before a headless corpse apparently known as “The Professor.”</p><p>Completely devoid of any sort of memory, “you,”　together with “Eve”—an android, and the Professor’s apparent killer—must uncover the truth of what really happened here.</p><p>Use your powers of deduction to unravel the mystery of this sealed laboratory, one revelation after another.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this all-new type of mystery – the kind that’s only possible with video games.</p><p><strong>Characters Depicted in Beautiful Hand-Drawn Animation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Main Character</strong> – Has no idea who they are due to total amnesia. Somewhat unreliable.</li><li><strong>Eve</strong> – An android. As the main character regains consciousness, Eve is standing before the corpse of “the Professor”. The heroine, and also the prime suspect.</li><li><strong>The Professor</strong> – Eve’s creator. Found as a headless corpse upon the main character’s awakening.</li><li><strong>Kel</strong> – An integrated discipline interface. Something like an AI that punishes people for their <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es, but which for some reason speaks like a little girl and can be quite agitating.</li></ul><p><strong>User Interface and Game Design that Change Along with Game Progress</strong></p><p>The user interface and game design in general change in accordance with your game progress.</p><p>The story and UI come together, and the general game design gradually transforms, providing an all-new, almost magic trick-like game experience.</p><p><strong>Main Staff and Comments</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scenario: Van Madoy</strong> (known for <em>Revoir</em> series, “Murder at Kogetsukan” in <em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>) – At the beginning of the project, I thought, “Is there even anything left for me to do in the world of mystery games that my predecessors haven’t already done themselves?” However, as development progressed, I reconsidered and thought, “Maybe I can realize the ideal mystery via the medium of video games.” The concept of this game is “a mystery that can be solved over and over again.” I hope you enjoy the experience of solving the kind of mystery that is only possible with video games—one that’s sort of different from other “multi-ending” games.</li><li><strong>Direction / Development: EIKI’</strong> (known for <em>GENSOU Skydrift</em>, <em>Living in the Ending World</em>) – I consider the adventure genre to actually be a no-rules, cross-species battle. We bring you an all-new breakthrough adventure worthy of its striking visuals and writing.</li><li><strong>Character Design / Animation: Yutaro</strong> (known for <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm7905073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Tegaki</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm27209687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Youyoumu: The Maximum Moving About</em></a>) – What’s the point of using hand-drawn animation to express characters in games, especially in adventure-style stand-up fashion? Well, I’d like to give any answer other than “This is the only way I can!,” so let’s say it’s that I’m striving to depict my art in a way that shows the pleasure and rawness of animation in an adventurelayout.</li><li><strong>Sound: RD-Sounds (Diao Ye Zong)</strong> (known for “Sacrament (Vatican Miracle Examiner ED),” “Absolute One-way Street ~Unreachable Message~ (<em>Touhou Project</em> Arrangement Track)”) – A story is, after all, a combination of pictures, sounds, and stories. Game scenes, controls, background music, sound effects, story, visuals… I want to find out just what I can do using sound to fuse all of these elements together in order to tell a “story” in a game.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Short Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); Short Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBvUUvyRV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); （エデン・スキマータ）Short PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7J5t311GPkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
