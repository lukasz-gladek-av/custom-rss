    <p><span>Embark on the second half of the Amphorean story alongside Hysilens and Cerydra.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [41 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Before Their Deaths,” will launch on August 13, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-981945"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update officially kicks off the second half of the Amphoreus story. Trailblazers will encounter new companions, confront fresh enemies and events, and witness old friends in entirely new forms. Hysilens and Cerydra will also make their long-awaited debut as playable characters, joining players in the next leg of the Amphorean trailblazing expedition.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Trailblazer made a promise to Phainon and took up the mantle of the Deliverer. In return, Phainon unleashed their blazing wrath upon Nanook, once again forcing Irontomb’s advance to a halt. Yet the journey is far from over, rescuing Amphoreus remains an unavoidable challenge. In the new Trailblaze Mission, the Trailblazer will accompany Cyrene into another cycle of Eternal Recurrence, traveling back a thousand years to the ancient Okhema. This was the age when Imperator Cerydra, the holder of the Law Coreflame, ruler of Okhema, Aglaea’s predecessor, still sat upon the throne of Okhema.</p><p>Version 3.5 introduces two powerful new characters to the team of Trailblazers. The first is Hysilens, commander of the holy city’s knights and a 5-star Physical-Type character following the Path of Nihility. Hysilens excels when paired with characters who specialize in DoT. Upon using her Ultimate, Hysilens creates a Zone. While the Zone is active, each instance of DoT inflicted on enemies will trigger an additional DoT from her. At the same time, all enemies will suffer reduced ATK and DEF. Moreover, her Basic ATK, Skill, and Ultimate each have a chance to apply a random type of DoT. Her Skill also increases the DMG enemies take, boosting the team’s overall DMG output.</p><p>The other 5-star Wind-Type character following the Path of Harmony, Imperator Cerydra, is the holder of the Law Coreflame and the initiator of the first Flame-Chase Journey. A master strategist raised on the principles of chess, she excels at long-term planning and command. In combat, her Skill grants an ally a special upgradable buff known as “Military Merit,” increasing the ally’s ATK and dealing additional DMG. As the battle progresses, Military Merit levels up. The affected ally will gain increased CRIT DMG and All-Type RES PEN when using Skills and can even replicate their Skill effects, boosting the team’s overall DMG output. Her Ultimate deals DMG to all enemies and obtains Charge for herself, providing sustained support for the team.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Stellaron Hunter Kafka and Silver Wolf will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.5 warp event. Their formidable support makes them invaluable allies for our Trailblazers’ future journeys.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_981947"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a brand-new map, offering Trailblazers a fresh glimpse into Styxia, the City of Infinite Revelry. The story will reach a turning point as Trailblazers face off directly against Lygus, an enemy who constantly shifts between two distinct forms. As the battle intensifies, his true identity and hidden motives may slowly be revealed.</p><p>Version 3.5 brings not only new characters and stories, but also a variety of fun-filled events for Trailblazers to enjoy. In the “Chrysos Maze Grand Restaurant” event, Trailblazers will work alongside the Chrysos Heirs to manage a restaurant in Aedes Elysiae. As a “Restaurant Manager,” you’ll serve delicious food to the fairies of the Membrance Maze and renovate the run-down venue by managing it wisely to win their praise and support. Meanwhile, in the “Old Brews &amp; New Friends” event, Trailblazers will once again step behind the counter as a guest drinksmith at the “Dreamjolt Hostelry,” mixing drinks and reuniting with familiar faces to share heartwarming moments.</p><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a voice toggle feature for collaboration characters. Trailblazers will be able to switch their interaction, combat, and idle voice lines between the in-game dub and the original licensed voice actors, offering a more immersive experience. Additionally, Honkai: Star Rail will be attending this year’s gamescom. Trailblazers are invited to stop by the event booth to check in and pick up some giveaways.
