On April 24, pre-orders and lottery sales for Switch 2 will also open nationwide at other Japanese retailers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Choose your path—build an economy based on farming or profit from monster-slaying (either way, don’t forget to collect taxes). Recruit adventurers and send them on quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. After all, everyone knows the only thing adventurers love more than glory… is gold.</p><p>With no army and no budget, you’ll have to throw gold at every problem and hope your hired heroes survive long enough to gear up, grow stronger, and maybe evolve into something more. If they don’t? Feed them to the pet god-beast you found snacking on your supplies. It’s growing faster than expected—so raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary, discipline it. Treat it well, and it just might become a trusted companion on your journey. Run the town, fund the chaos, and hope your gold lasts longer than your heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free. Their loyalty lies with GOLD! You’ll have to recruit them with promises of gold or glory, and give them quests! Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,225 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world. Humans, beastmen, mothmen, undead, and more may join your cause. Pick them all, or only your favorites!</li><li><strong>Build a City</strong> – Build a thriving city around a monster-filled dungeon. Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,683 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
