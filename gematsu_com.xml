A demo is available now. <span id="more-1023434"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>MANIFESTO</em> is a new management sim about burnout, layoffs, and making shitloads of money.</p><p>You’ve climbed the ranks, left countless competitors in your wake, and proven you have what it takes to survive in this cut-throat business. With this latest venture, you’ll have to put any human feelings you’ve ever experienced aside, and attempt to satisfy shareholders who can never truly be satisfied.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Make extremely ethical decisions to keep the sales flowing.</li><li>Hire employees, then burn them out for profit.</li><li><a title="Games > Reach [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reach">Reach</a> entirely unrealistic sale targets in a small amount of time.</li><li>Unlock power-ups and stack effects to juice those numbers.</li><li>Expand and level up your company, but try not to crumble under the pressure.</li></ul><p><strong>Is This Some Kind of Commentary on the Current State of the Video Game Industry?</strong></p><p>Oh god no, we wouldn’t dream of it. There’s zero chance we would use the medium of video games to comment on the fact that one-third of developers were laid off in the last two years. Or that CEOs and upper management take huge bonuses, while employees take all the brunt of their crappy choices. <em>MANIFESTO</em> is just a video game, stop reading into things that aren’t there, okay?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="MANIFESTO Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3thUUXveYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/management-simulation-game-manifesto-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
