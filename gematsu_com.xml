They delivered the end of the world.”</p><p>Hello Sunshine is a mystery survival RPG set in the sun-scorched ruins of a corporate empire. You play the final employee. Your mission: reach the tower at the end of the road, and help decide the fate of what remains of this world.</p><p>To survive the blistering heat and deadly sun, you’ll walk in the shadow of a towering war machine, scavenging for supplies and searching for pieces to the puzzle.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When the sun sets and the robot stops to charge, you’ll make camp, craft new gear, and repair your mechanical guardian. But the wasteland is freezing cold at night. Stay close to the robot to keep warm.</p><p>The journey to the tower is long. You won’t make it on your own. As the sun rises, the robot starts walking. Follow—and stay alive until the end of the road.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_949803"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Walk in the Shadow of a Giant Robot</strong> – The sun is your enemy. The robot’s shadow provides protection from the heat and radiation. Stay in the shade or risk exposure—but the further into the wasteland you venture, the greater the rewards.</li><li><strong>Survive the Freezing Nights</strong> – The wasteland turns bitterly cold after sundown. After the robot stops to recharge at a Sunshine Service Station, you must stay close to keep warm. Make camp, cook food, craft new gear, upgrade your equipment—and keep an eye out for visiting strangers, for appearances can deceive.</li><li><strong>Repair, Customize, and Upgrade Your <a title="Platforms > Mobile [2,746 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/mobile">Mobile</a> Base</strong> – The wandering robot is more than a companion—it’s your lifeline. <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a> it with improved sensors, defensive systems, and mechanical upgrades. Add decals and personal touches, even a fresh coat of paint.</li><li><strong>Build a Lasting Relationship With the Robot</strong> – At first, the colossus barely acknowledges you. Over time, your bond strengthens. Assist the robot with repairs, install upgrades, and unlock new ways to interact. In return, the metal giant will aid you on your journey—locating secrets hidden in the desert, lifting you past obstacles, shielding you from threats, fighting back against hostile war machines.</li><li><strong>Scavenge, Craft, Progress</strong> – Salvage resources from supply drops and storage units, scavenge downed war machines, military stations and abandoned settlements. At night, use a Sunshine Recycler to break loot into base components, and craft gear, tools and weapons to improve your odds of survival.</li><li><strong>Deploy your Little Guys</strong> – Assemble and program helper bots to automate and assist in common tasks like gathering resources, mapping terrain, hunting prey, and defending against drone attacks.</li><li><strong>Piece Together the Mystery of a Broken World</strong> – Sunshine sold humanity a brighter future. Instead, the corporation left behind a wasteland of automated systems still waging war long after their creators vanished. Who is the Final Employee? What is the giant white tower at the end of the road? And what happens when the last machine remembers your name?</li><li><strong>Rise in the Corporate Hierarchy</strong> – Complete menial tasks to gain employee levels and earn bonus points, unlocking vending machines, rest areas and self-care rooms, and other workplace perks from Sunshine’s automated service stations. After all, a dependable employee gets the best benefits!</li><li><strong>Play Solo or Cooperatively</strong> – Team up with a friend (or workmate) to experience the journey from different perspectives. Coordinate scavenging runs, trade resources, and explore how your peculiar partnership shapes the unfolding narrative.</li></ul><p>The sun is rising. The robot is moving. Keep walking.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.
