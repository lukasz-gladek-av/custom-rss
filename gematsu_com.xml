We are using our own proprietary Intellectual Camera System—designed to find the most cinematic angles for the action on screen without interrupting gameplay—as well as embracing bold camera choices, including the use of pre-set cameras in certain scenes. Many of these decisions are inspired by iconic moments from classic action films. Players may spot some homages to scenes from <em>John Wick Chapter 4</em> and <em>Old Boy</em> in today’s teaser.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nekki:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>SPINE</em> is a single-player, story-rich action game where the player takes on the role of rebellious street artist Redline, accompanied by her sentient combat implant, Spine. Players join them as they challenge the autocratic AI regime of Tensor Corporation while learning to trust each other.</p><p><em>SPINE</em> features camerawork and combat choreography by action movie stunt specialists and is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and Nekki’s original animation engine, Cascadeur, making players the star of their own action movie where no two fights are the same.</p><!-- AD: content -->

It’s not just a game; it’s an artistic canvas for your own style of destruction.</li><li><strong>Unrivaled Atmosphere</strong> – Dive into an action-packed narrative set against the backdrop of a captivating cyberpunk world. Explore the contrast between the gleaming, utopian facades and the gritty, decaying alleyways, as each location becomes a stage for adrenaline-fueled gunfights.</li><li><strong>Gripping Narrative</strong> – Embark on a gritty journey into the near-future with Redline, a rebellious street artist, and her AI companion, Spine—a combat implant with a mind of its own.

My hope is that Alta’s story can help players reflect on their own paths, and find some glimmer of hope and rest that everyone needs more of in their lives.”</p><div id="carousel_931679"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is a narrative-centric cozy game about change and tea. Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.</p><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is a tea shop <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> ritual. Grow and harvest the ingredients needed for tea, and then mix them together in an unusual tea-making contraption. Along the way, speak with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learn their stories and make tea that’s just right for them.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.</p><p>And that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it… she can’t…</p><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is a game from the team at Ivy Road, including Davey Wreden (creator of <em>The Stanley Parable</em> and <em>The Beginner’s Guide</em>), Karla Zimonja (co-creator of <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Tacoma</em>) and Daniel “C418” Rosenfeld (the music of Minecraft).</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
