Something hopeful, but not cozy. <em>KinForge</em> builds on pieces from our favorite games, combining the mastery-driven intensity of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> with the emotional depth of creature collectors, all wrapped in the social DNA that made games like <em>EverQuest</em> timeless. At its heart, it’s a story about redemption.”</p><div id="carousel_1005911"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Seeker Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>KinForge</em> is a cooperative, creature-collector action RPG where every fusion of powers creates new experiences, wild combos, and the strength to fight against spreading Corruption. Forge bonds with <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> <a title="Companies > Elementa [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>ls, beings of the <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ic Realm, and restore a world on the brink of collapse.</p><p><strong>Nature Has Had Enough</strong></p><p>In a world much like ours, Elementals are the invisible hand of nature itself. They breathe life into the wind, guide the tides, and spark the fires that sustain the world. Humanity discovered how to enslave them, harnessing their power to fuel modern technology and industry. But forced servitude drove them mad. Corrupted and broken, they turned against the natural order, and the balance of the world began to collapse. Storms now rage unchecked, forests rot, and the planet itself rebels.</p><p>You are one of the rare few chosen by the Ancient Elementals to help restore what has been lost. Bond with these living powers, wield their abilities, and lead the fight to heal a planet on the brink of destruction.</p><p><strong>Bond With Living Powers</strong></p><p>Elementals are not tools. They are living forces with purpose, emotion, and will. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>nse corrupted spirits and form lasting bonds with the ones you save. Each Ancient Elemental you befriend grants a new ability to wield in battle, from searing bolts of flame to barriers of living stone. Lesser spirits, known as Sprites, can then be woven into those abilities, twisting and amplifying their effects. Create an experience that feels entirely your own by finding the perfect pairing between Sprites and Ancients.</p><p>Every fusion changes how you fight. The right pairing might turn a fire blast into a homing inferno or cause a simple strike to erupt in a storm of lightning and ash. With billions of potential combinations, the line between chaos and mastery blurs and the most chaotic combinations often become the most brilliant.</p><p><strong>Fight Alone or Together</strong></p><p>Play solo or with up to three others. Venture into corrupted regions, rescue lost spirits, and confront the human Overseers who twisted nature for profit. Every Elemental you save adds new possibilities, empowering you to push further against the spreading Corruption.</p><p><strong>Your <a title="Games > Preserve [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/preserve">Preserve</a>, Your Sanctuary</strong></p><p>Between missions, return to your Preserve, a living refuge where you and your allies regroup and rebuild. Reincarnate fallen Elementals, craft new ability kits, and construct upgrades that strengthen your campaign.</p><p><strong>Worlds Reforged</strong></p><p>Every campaign begins fresh, shaped by an Overseer whose power defines the challenges ahead. Each new journey is procedurally generated and seeded with the Elementals, enemies, and upgrades you’ve already unlocked, allowing new discoveries to emerge from what came before. Over time, your growing collection transforms not just how you play, but the worlds themselves.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>10-Hour Campaigns</strong> – Each campaign centers on a powerful Overseer whose influence defines enemies, environments, and challenges.</li><li><strong>Enduring Progression</strong> – Every campaign begins fresh but carries forward everything you have unlocked previously. New Elementals, bosses, and relics await discovery.</li><li><strong>Mission-Based <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,696 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>s</strong> – Short, focused missions keep every session meaningful while feeding into the larger restoration effort.</li><li><strong>Grow Between Missions</strong> – Strengthen bonds, craft upgrades, and prepare for what comes next.</li><li><strong>Procedural Replayability</strong> – Maps, enemies, and the Overseer’s tactics shift each run, ensuring every campaign feels distinct.</li></ul><p><em>KinForge</em> is a standalone, cooperative action RPG about connection, courage, and renewal. Built around 100+ hours of handcrafted and procedural content, it offers deep replayability without live-service grind.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
