What chaos ensues when Grandma gets stuck babysitting her grandkid out of the blue?</p><p><em>Grandma, No!</em> is a physics-based, laugh-out-loud adventure where the player steps into the worn-out slippers of a grandma who’s in way over her head. She is trying to survive her day without burning the house down—or maybe she’ll embrace the mayhem.</p><p>The gameplay takes a turn when “simple” tasks go off the rails. Taking out the trash may lead to somewhere unexpected, while cooking dinner could end up with more fire than flavor. Each challenge is designed to be wilder than the last, and new outfits for Grandma can be unlocked along the way, so she can tackle the mayhem in style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
