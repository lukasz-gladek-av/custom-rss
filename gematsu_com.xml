These battles may be more challenging than in other modes and have special gameplay experiences unique to this mode, so we definitely encourage you to give it a try.</li><li><strong>Hero’s Diary</strong> – Unlocked after clearing Team Mission. In this mode, you can watch never-before-seen character moments with each other with voice acting that depict the unknown daily lives of the U.A.
