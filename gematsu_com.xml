Cygnus Cross showed me that not only is <em>Emberville</em> an incredibly cool idea, but they also have that detail and nuance in overflowing abundance. Their care and commitment to creating something with legacy and quality for their players is what truly makes me excited about <em>Emberville</em>. Oh, and I lied to Doug [Cockle] about him getting sausages to help get the deal across the line… don’t tell him.”</p><p>Previously revealed cast member Doug Cockle added, “The passion, skill, and experience going into the development of this game is phenomenal. I’m always attracted to projects where the team has a clear goal in mind, and the drive and knowledge to reach for it, especially when that goal pushes boundaries. That’s exciting to be part of. Plus, they told me there would be small sausages. I like small sausages.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
