Are you really… you?</p><p>A few years after the events in the first Urban Legend Hunters, the disappearance of a popular internet show host and influencer Chris became a hot topic on the internet. You, an outsider clueless about the incident, meet Rain, Shou, and Tangtang, who claim to be members of Chris’ channel, on a messaging app. They suspect that Chris’ disappearance has to do with the urban legend of the “double”, as well as the Urban Legend Hunters community. They ask you to join in their search for Chris, and the more you investigate and the more clues you gather, the closer you get to seeing the full picture of what really happened…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Cutscenes with real actors paired with virtual landscapes combine the real and unreal to transport you to a mysterious and unsettling alternate dimension.</li><li>Text messages and voice calls that create an immersive game experience.</li><li>Unique exploration mechanics that make you feel you’re really there in the alternate dimensions.</li><li>A rich story filled with suspense and intrigue.</li><li>A wide variety of puzzles waiting to be solved.</li><li>Builds on the series tradition of Urban Legend Hunters and expands on the “modern culture-bound syndrome” phenomenon.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Urban Legend Hunters 2: Double - New Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ScgmBA8x5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="分身: 都市伝説チャンネル奇話 | 新PV公開！ 今冬発売予定で鋭意開発進行中！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaNkvh8UoFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="都市傳說冒險團2：分身 | 新PV現已公布！計劃於今冬發售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QBdOZntUFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="都市传说冒险团2 ：分身 | 新PV现已公布！计划于今冬发售！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DonTS8NJkjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing – spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!
