We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p><p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p><p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for fiscal year 26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead.</p><p>Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p><p>Best,<br>Hermen Hulst<br>CEO, Studio Business Group</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-shut-down-bluepoint-games]]></content:encoded>

Chat to quirky customers with unique tastes, explore a handcrafted record collection, fall in love with bands (and their drama!), or just slack off with your colleagues—whatever gets everyone’s groove back!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Immersive Cozy-punk Life Sim</strong> – Lose yourself in an emotional, uplifting narrative about community, musical mysteries and underdog spirit. Help endearing and indecisive customers find their perfect records while debating all things music with your loveable colleagues. It’s your job to help Repeater Records find its rhythm again!</li><li><strong>Original Killer Soundtrack</strong> – Drop the needle on a stacked soundtrack featuring dozens of original tracks spanning across many genres, bands, and eras. Every song is crafted to feel like a nostalgic gem. From grimy basement bangers to dreamy indie deep cuts. It’s a playlist built to loop in your head long after you clock out.</li><li><strong>Handcrafted Record Collection</strong> – Dig through crates packed with 80+ hand‑drawn albums, lovingly imagined bands, and liner note lore that rewards curiosity. Each record has its own personality, history, and fanbase. Did Scandinavian metal band Jarhead really murder their singer and put his head in a jar? Is it true big shot rapper RXXX used to be a kid’s TV presenter? Has anyone ever seen Mimi?</li><li><strong>Motley Crew of Loveable Oddballs</strong> – Repeater Records is staffed and frequented by a rotating cast of eccentrics, music nerds, and chaotic regulars. Every character is bursting with personality, quirks, and questionable opinions about what “real music” is. Get to know them and enjoy their banter. They’re the soul of the shop after all!</li><li><strong>Crates of Puzzles to Dig Through</strong> – From customer requests to store shenanigans, you’ll dive into a variety of cozy puzzles. Decode clues and hunt for the perfect music recommendation by browsing records, scrolling social media, and poring over local music zines. You might even find yourself running the lights for local bands, designing gig posters and packing orders!</li><li><strong>Creators of Wax Heads</strong> – Patattie Games is the two-person indie punk duo made up of developers; creative doodler Murray Somerwolff (<em>Welcome to Elk</em>, <em>Spitkiss</em>, <em>Dead Pets Unleashed</em>) and creative programmer Rothio Tome (former UNITY developer support engineer and top Spanish GameDev streamer).</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
