It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,963 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,808 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,721 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,492 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/" target="_blank">Steam</a> this summer. <span id="more-947433"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coatsink:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> recreates the relaxing atmosphere and streamlined strategy that made the original such a hit, and builds on those foundations with new mechanics, modes, and features.</p><p><em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> invites you back to a world of tranquil creativity that welcomes longtime fans and newcomers to explore, build, and strategize like never before. In <em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em>, you are presented with a series of beautiful islands to build on, starting each level with an inventory of buildings to choose from. Carefully consider where to place them to get the most points over the course of the stage as you unlock more structures as part of an experience that reigns in the overwhelming complexity of the sprawling city-builder to deliver minimalist shots of short yet cerebral strategy.</p><p>Let’s unroll the blueprints and take a look at the new features <em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> is bringing too! One key new feature is the introduction of “boons.” Boons are one-time power ups unlocked on each stage as you collect points, offering a helping hand that will become vital as you take on the game’s tricker levels. Boons can allow you to duplicate buildings in your inventory and replace buildings you’ve already built. There’s more for you to discover yourself in the full game, with each boon offering an intriguing new twist on how you go about building your city.</p><!-- AD: content -->
