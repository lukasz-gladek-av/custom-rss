Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal. Sin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy’s wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world.</p><!-- AD: content -->

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-939335"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via perelesoq:</p><blockquote><p><em>Snow Town Geek Store</em> is a simulator where you work as a salesman in a 2000s-style geek store.</p><p>Play as a high school dropout trying to save up for a vacation for his mom and a better life for himself. Sell CDs, merch, and snacks: <em>Half-Life</em>, <em>The Sims 2</em>, and <em>Shrek</em> discs, Cheetos, beer, and Hubba Bubba. Build collections of rare merch and pogs, customize your desk, and play retro mini-games. Cheat customers (if your conscience allows) and chat with them to solve their problems or guess their preferences. By stocking the right products, you can turn your humble little shop into the ultimate geek destination—or a shady spot black market goods.</p><p>Maybe then the emo girl will take you seriously? The game blends colorful pixel art in third-person view with first-person <a title="Platforms > PS1 [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps1">PlayStation 1</a>-inspired 3D graphics.</p><p>The sound effects are inspired by 8-bit games and <em>The Sims</em> series.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
