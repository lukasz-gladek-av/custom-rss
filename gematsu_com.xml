An average teen, she passes the time with nothing particularly special about her life.</p><p>Until, that is, a deep fog descends on Ebisugaoka, and everything Hinako knows crumbles as she finds her once-familiar home infested with spreading danger, the town empty except for the <a title="Genres > Horror [571 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s teeming in the fog.</p><p>Now, as she navigates the twisting paths of Ebisugaoka, Hinako must solve puzzles and fight for her life in her struggle to survive.</p><p>Her struggle to reach the inevitable decision that must be made.

A teenage girl struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. Cheerful and energetic as a child, she’s grown to become much more restrained, and now hardly smiles.</li></ul><p><strong>Staff Comments</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scriptwriter <a href="https://twitter.com/07th_official" target="_blank">Ryukishi07</a></strong> – “To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the suffocating and oppressive atmosphere of <em>Silent Hill</em>. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It’s an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I’ve poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don’t think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote. To me, the <em>Silent Hill</em> series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind. It’s my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. And to all of our overseas friends, I hope you’ll enjoy a look at what <em>Silent Hill</em> might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.”</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a> and Character Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/kera_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kera</a></strong> – “I love the <em>Silent Hill</em> series, and it’s been a big influence on me. In particular, I am constantly remembering <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to <em>Silent Hill f</em>, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that’s come in <em>Silent Hill</em> before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be <em>Silent Hill</em>. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy our vision and the world we’ve created.”</li><li><strong>Composer <a href="https://twitter.com/ken_inage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kensuke Inage</a></strong> – “The first time I played <em>Silent Hill</em> was about 20 years back. I’m extremely honored to have been offered such a great opportunity for a series with a rich history. I was in charge of composing the music for the Otherworld, known in this game as the ‘Dark Shrine.’ I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes. I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protagonist’s agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions. I hope you get to experience it for yourself in the game.”</li></ul><p>*Other composers include <a href="https://twitter.com/akirayamaoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akira Yamaoka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/higu_dai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dai</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/xaki_k_sakita" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xaki</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>This game contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence.</p><p>This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time.
