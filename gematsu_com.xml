        <p><em>Serpent’s Gaze</em> features handcrafted levels, with no procedural generation, best enjoyed in up to four-player cooperative play, though the game can also be played in single-player.

Choose wisely and explore endless builds and strategies.</li><li><strong>Get Cursed by the Gods, and Adapt to New Challenges</strong> – The Curse system introduces random variables every run—everything from minibosses hunting you, to environmental hazards that keep new runs fresh and challenging. The Awareness system brings even more challenges, making each successful run progressively harder.</li><li><strong>Explore an <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> Desert and Its <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>eries</strong> – Battle through imposing environments inhabited by different factions.
