Players can create and customize their own personal chaos gremlin, who are sent underground by the titular <em>Mother Machine</em> to battle alien enemies, discover rare technology, and uncover the mysterious planet’s darkest secrets.</p><p>In <em>Mother Machine</em>, players can:</p><ul><li>Create and control their own unique chaos gremlin, capable of seamlessly running, climbing and leaping through intricate procedurally-generated alien caves</li><li>Customize the abilities of their gremlins with a range of mutations, altering gameplay to suit their preferred playstyle</li><li>Share the experience with friends of all skill levels, as the game’s balanced cooperative mechanics allow expert cave-runners to join together with novices</li><li><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> unique moments created by emergent gameplay, idiosyncratic level design and the singular brand of chaos that comes from you and your best gaming buddies</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Set thousands of years in the future, <em>Mother Machine</em> takes place on a distant planet once colonized by humans but since abandoned. Left behind by her creators, an Artificial Intelligence faced a problem: without a purpose, she needed to find a way to protect her digital mind from breaking under the burden of being forever alone. Her solution was to create creatures she could care for.</p><p>True rascals, with an affinity for mischief and chaos, these little gremlins were bioengineered by their mother to withstand and survive a harsh alien environment. 3D-printed from organic filament by their godlike <em>Mother Machine</em>, these creatures are tasked to collect and explore a vast cave network of a mysterious alien planet, brimming with biodiversity and peculiar life-forms—but the further the gremlins venture, the more they find out about the dark secrets of the planet’s history, and the true ambitions of their mechanical mother.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Obtain valuable gear, and store it in a safe zone. Or build your own fortress in the wild, securing it with turrets, making it cozy while boosting your stats, and use it to store your vehicles and loot. Traverse the world by foot, car, motorcycle, boat, or a Quick Travel metro system. Make friends or enemies. Join Player-Versus-Player or Player-Versus-Environment servers. Explore the vast open world filled with challenging events, and raid your enemies.</p><p><strong>Player-Versus-Player, Player-Versus-Environment, Raiding</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We have three types of servers in <em>Deadside</em> 1.0: Player-Versus-Player, Player-Versus-Environment, and Player-Versus-Player No Raids.</p><p>Note on all three types of servers your player disappears when offline with all loot on your body</p><ul><li>Player-Versus-Player servers provide an intense hardcore experience where players can engage in fights, and can raid each other’s bases with no limits.</li><li>Player-Versus-Environment servers are a more chill experience where you can interact with other players, and can’t fight each other or raid/steal each other’s bases. We recommend this mode to learn the game’s mechanics.</li><li>Player-Versus-Player No Raids are a blend of both, where you can fight each other while being unable to raid bases.</li></ul><p><strong>Vehicles and Fast Travel</strong></p><p>Nobody likes running forever in open world <a title="Genres > Survival [377 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>. <em>Deadside</em> has boats, motorcycles, cars, and a Fast Travel System to easily get around the map. Secure your vehicles with codelocks and use them for storage.</p><p><strong>Base Building and Comfort System</strong></p><p>Build a secluded shack or a secured fortress. We made it easy to build with an intuitive tool, and added plenty of comfort items which are useful for gameplay boosts. Secure your base with passive defenses such as turrets and traps. Store your vehicles, and keep your hard earned loot safe from raiders.</p><p><strong>The World of <em>Deadside</em></strong></p><p>Explore the forests, rivers, and settlements of this post-soviet apocalypse. You can build anywhere outside of settlements. Challenging NPCs patrol the map, and your progression is solely decided by your own skill. There are no levels or bars. Your level is your skill and the equipment you acquire.</p><p><strong>Weapons, Combat System, Missions</strong></p><p>It’s all about the ballistics and variety of weapons. Choose from 32 firearms, and modify them with scopes, expanded mags, flashlights, silencers and other modules. Feeling tactical? Setup tripwire traps, respawn bags, use smoke grenades for cover. The combat system is designed to be hardcore. Combine this with an intuitive missions system with clearly marked objectives on the map and you have the perfect hardcore survival shooter.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,927 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DEADSIDE Console Launch Trailer (Xbox &amp; PlayStation 5)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQihnFiJ3do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait.”</p><p>Duncan continued, “I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team. If you think about their history and legacy for <em>Forza Horizon</em>, the last two games—critically acclaimed, award-winning, beautiful, played great. And just what they’re bringing to <em>Fable</em> as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games, plus amazing gameplay, British humor, Playground’s version of Albion—so inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise, but their take. And quite frankly, the most beautifully realized version of Albion you’ve ever seen. So really excited about the plans and really excited about the future and I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games, and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best games, or the best game for the community.”</p><p><em>Fable</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.</p><p>Watch some new footage below (from 15:56 to 17:02).</p><h2><span>New Footage</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->
