Join the Remnant expedition to earn the exclusive asymmetrical cabin reward!</li><li><strong>Volatile Waste</strong> – Industrial waste is more than scrap metal: it can also be found in the form of toxic barrels, radioactive crates, and explosive canisters! <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>ful scrap-hunters will take care to handle volatile waste responsibly.</li><li><strong>Paint Finishes</strong> – Add the final touch to your Colossus configuration with a selection of paint finishes, applicable alongside your color of choice. Sign up for the Remnant expedition to earn the limited edition camouflage finish.</li><li><strong>Excavation Blade Technology</strong> – Augment your Colossus Exocraft with a new obstacle demolition attachment.
