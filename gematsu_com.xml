However, since N.A. himself is unable to enter the Chara World, Tisiel and her familiars will take on the challenge.</p><p>In the Chara World, Tisiel will spin a slot machine to determine the number of spaces she can move forward.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>Various events will occur depending on where you land, and N.A. can be strengthened based on the type of event.</p><p><em>—N.A. can be strengthened with various power-ups such as increased HP, additional mana, and more.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By utilizing Tisiel and her familiars’ special skills, you can strengthen N.A. more efficiently.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>When you land on a battle space, the familiars will enter battle against enemy monsters.

They come in various types and power levels, and equipping them grants benefits. Through “Innocents Management,” you can move and manage the Innocents residing in your equipped items.</p><p><em>—Gain the upper hand in battle by moving as many Innocents as possible to the equipment you use the most.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are two states of Innocents: “Subdued” and “Unsubdued.” Unsubdued Innocents may appear as enemies in the Item World, and defeating them will increase that Innocent’s power. Go after them whenever they appear!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Breeder</strong></p><p>By forming a contract with a captured monster, you can take it along in battle to fight alongside you. Monsters with which you have formed contracts are called “familiars.” At the Breeder, in addition to forming familiar contracts, you can also “extract” monsters you do not wish to contract with in exchange for mana. As the story progresses, you will also gain access to familiar strengthening options such as “Magichange” and “Reincarnation.”</p><p><em>—There are 16 types of monsters you can befriend as familiars, each with unique appearances, abilities, and skills. Power up your favorite familiars into the best possible partners.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—During battle, familiars act according to strategy and provide support to N.A.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Debate Assembly</strong></p><p>By holding an assembly, you can propose and enact various requests. To enact your requests, you must win a debate. Enlist the support of many assembly members before the vote through bribes and other means to ensure your agenda passes.</p><p><em>—Convince the assembly to approve agendas that benefit you, such as increasing EXP earned or expanding the number of items you can carry.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_023.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can increase support through bribery, put the opposition to sleep… or maybe even persuade them by force?</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_024.jpg"></a></figure><p>By choosing “I want to be reincarnated!” during a Debate Assembly, the protagonist N.A. can be reincarnated, carrying over some of his stats while returning to level 1. Depending on his growth thus far, he may receive bonus points that can be allocated to strengthen his initial stats.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_025.jpg"></a></figure><p>Raising N.A. again with higher initial stats, an even stronger version of him will rise. By repeating the process of reincarnation and redevelopment over and over, you can continue strengthening the protagonist without limit!</p><p><strong>■ Cheat Shop</strong></p><p>At the Cheat Shop, players can modify various aspects of game balance and world settings to suit their preferences, such as strengthening enemies or altering reward ratios. If you want to level up quickly, you can adjust parameters to lower money and mana acquisition rates in exchange for earning significantly more EXP.</p><p><em>—You may even be able to change the enemy’s strength or weaken an overpowered N.A.?!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kyouran-Makaism_2025_12-18-25_026.jpg"></a></figure></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/kyouran-makaism-details-base-facilities]]></content:encoded>
