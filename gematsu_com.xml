When I first heard about the movie, I wondered how they would turn a game without a story into a movie, but I believe they’ve managed to make something interesting without compromising <em>The Exit 8</em>‘s world and atmosphere! I even got to visit the set, and it was crazy to see the underground passage and man [from the game] right there in front of me! I hope everyone is looking forward to it! I’m really looking forward to its release myself!”</p><p><em>The Exit 8</em> is available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2653790/The_Exit_8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.
