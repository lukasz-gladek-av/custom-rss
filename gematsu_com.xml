Assemble your team from a diverse set of characters and test your skills against yōkai and steampunk contraptions. Carve your own path through an immersive story and change the very fate of the Empire.</p><p>Step into 1868 Japan, a land fiercely divided by a brutal civil war between the traditionalist forces of Shogun Tokugawa and the technologically superior army of Emperor Mutsuhito, backed by the British East Nippon Company. Amidst this turmoil, warriors, spies, and mystical beings navigate a world where magic and machinery intertwine, the jarring contrast of tradition and technology permeating even the landscape, where weathered, ancient temples stand alongside towering steam-powered machines. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a country at a pivotal crossroads, torn between its cherished ancient heritage and the relentless march of modernization.

Throughout their arduous journey, new heroes will join their cause, each with their own past and motivations. Together, they will confront tremendous and ever-growing dangers, striving to reclaim their honor and change the course of history. Every choice you make will guide your characters along unique and captivating paths: form new bonds, sever lifelong friendships, or mend fractured family ties. Your decisions will shape who they become.</p><p><strong>Different Characters</strong></p><p>Take on the role of master strategist as you guide your band of warriors in both combat and conscience. Each character has a variety of backgrounds and skills, as well as their own motivations, desires, and fears… Build a team that compliments your preferred tactics and your personality.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>Experience classic, turn-based combat with a samurai-tactics flare. Each team member brings their own distinctive set of skills and abilities to the battlefield. Even their personal goals and relationships influence every encounter. If you can master these social and strategic dynamics, then you and your team will no doubt dominate the battlefield.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>East Nippon Company Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="2026 Release Trailer — East Nippon Company" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6FJh-7IQ84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/shadow-of-the-road-launches-in-2026]]></content:encoded>
