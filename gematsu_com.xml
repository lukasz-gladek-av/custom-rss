A PlayStation 5 version is also in development.</p><p>“We have polished the game and added necessary core features with many updates during Early Access to create a fun, light extraction dungeon crawler,” said director Sejun Go in a press release. “These improvements, combined with the addition of new Stalkers and a brand-new map, will make Season 1 the most engaging and enjoyable experience that players have been waiting for.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>During Early Access, Dungeon Stalkers underwent a rapid pace of updates based on community feedback. The team introduced new enemies, raid bosses, legendary gear, and additional dungeons, while also improving balance, killcam, solo ranking, controller support, reconnect functionality, and many other features. These updates culminate in the full 1.0 release, which officially kicks off a new season today.</p><p><strong>What’s New in 1.0</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Stalker Kazimorde</strong> – A legendary officer of the Tania Kingdom and a warrior known as the “Flash Hawk.” Kazimorde is a melee warrior who wields twin blades with expertise, boasting overwhelming DPS through fast normal attacks and combo attacks. He continuously attacks enemies with an attack tempo 20-30% faster than other Stalkers.</li><li><strong>Mansion of Desire Dungeon</strong> – The manor of a noble aristocratic family from Asion has been swallowed into a rift of curses, becoming the “Mansion of Desire.” Within this rift, the manor retains its antique and luxurious appearance, yet exudes an eerie atmosphere, offering a new exploration experience distinct from the existing “Prison Dungeon.”</li><li><strong>Insurance System: Scavenger Contract</strong> – Introducing “Scavenger,” a new NPC designed to alleviate the burden of equipment loss in Competitive Mode. By paying a small amount of Gold and entering into a contract with the Scavenger before entering Competitive (Solo, Trio) mode, you can recover your equipment if you fail to escape the dungeon.</li><li><strong>Profile Customization System</strong> – A profile system will be added, allowing you to customize your profile card. Your profile will display borders, banner images, icons, and titles. Each of these elements will be unlockable through gameplay or purchasable with currency.</li><li><strong>Season Reputation Point Reward System</strong> – “Reputation Points” will be awarded based on the sum of all Stalkers levels players achieved during the Pre-season. Reputation Points can be used in an exclusive shop to purchase special items such as profile icons, banners, and Stalkers skins.</li><li><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong> – An array of various quality-of-life improvements, balance adjustments, a wider array of Legendary items, event content, and client/server stability enhancements are currently being prepared.</li><li><strong>Legendary Nave Season Skin / Twitch Drop Nave Skin</strong></li><li><strong>Stalker Black Maria</strong> (one month after launch) – A high-ranking Inquisitor known as “White Night,” Black Maria is a warrior character whose core playstyle revolves around charged (RMB) attacks with a two-handed greatsword. She delivers powerful single blows through skill combos that combine engagement abilities, sustain, and shock skills.</li><li><strong>Raid Boss The Mimic Queen</strong> (one month after launch) – An exciting and grotesque challenge to conquer, Amelia, the mistress of the Mansion of Desire, could not escape the Witch’s Curse in the chaos of the dungeon that twisted her body, and she merged with the gigantic, ornate treasure chest she cherished most.</li></ul><p>The game sets itself apart from others in the extraction genre by focusing on unique characters, their gameplay abilities, as well as their stories within the dungeon. There are 6 characters each with unique playstyles, movesets and gear types available immediately, with four unlockable with in-game currency and more to come as the game continues to release content to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting with each update.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Armor Destruction System</strong> – As characters take damage, this is represented visually with degraded armor and can be seen by enemy players, adding tension and strategic depth on how and when to engage.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Witch’s Curse System</strong> – The Witch’s Curse changes dungeon conditions multiple times per session. Each 5 minute phase can bestow buffs, debuffs, summon power monsters or change rules on at moment’s notice</li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – Choose between a lighter, fun and casual player-versus-environment experience or hardcore competitive player-versus-environment-versus-player dungeon run modes to suit your style and do so with teammates or solo.</li><li><strong>Play as Unique Stalkers</strong> – Select from a roster of vivid, story-driven characters with diverse abilities and discover the story behind why each of them has found themselves here and unfold the secrets to the dungeon itself!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dungeon Stalkers - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1sUqRSLbqUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/dungeon-stalkers-for-pc-now-available]]></content:encoded>

Her timing sparks disaster as the town quickly descends into a deadly game of survival against omnipresent floral overgrowth. Players must solve ingenious puzzles, defeat horrifying enemies, and uncover a mysterious plan to create new life in the most inhuman way imaginable.</p><p>Exploring Joycliffe and its surroundings reveals many dark secrets. Players must use their intuition and observation skills to determine the best path forward, using an array of hidden items and cryptic clues to make progress. Key information is recorded via the in-game journal, which includes story discoveries and data of floral specimens. Players will discover many weapon types throughout the game to do battle against evolving enemies and bosses. The world of Joycliffe is always changing, and as day turns into night the floral growth presents new deadly foes with abilities that change over the course of the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1003001"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>The Florist</em> has cultivated a unique identity of color and beauty to bring something special to fans around the world.

With hand-crafted environments and fixed camera design, every level has been finely developed for both beauty and playability. </p><!-- AD: content -->
