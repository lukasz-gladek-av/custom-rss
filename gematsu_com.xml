        <p>The “Yuki Onna” or snow woman moves quickly and glides with barely a sound. Make sure you listen carefully or she’ll appear when you least expect it! When Yuki Onna finds you, she spits out a blizzard which causes the player to be frozen in ice. Take care to watch the floors too, if they’re frozen by Yuki Onna, you’re likely to slip around and be caught more easily.</p><p><strong>About “The Mine”</strong></p><p>The mine was once a site where silver ore was excavated with vigor. Back in those days, silver was highly valued by those in power and it would take several hours to traverse through all of the tunnels.</p><p>Many workers were employed to dig through this maze of large tunnels. It was also difficult to get to the mines from the nearest village due to its rugged surroundings coupled with heavy snowfall. It was common for workers of the mine to sleep in a bare bones rest area in the tunnels, forced to work everyday without getting enough sleep. As a result, it was common for people to lose their lives due to accidents caused by human error.</p><p>The site grew to be revered as a mine that “once you enter, you never leave.”</p><p><strong>About the Downloadable Content</strong></p><p>Our very first downloadable content includes two additional characters and a soundtrack to the game. The characters come from the recent film <em>Birth of Kitaro: The <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery of GeGeGe</em> and will give players the opportunity to dress up as Kitaro’s Father and Mizuki. These characters also come with additional character-specific perks so be sure to check these out! The price of the character downloadable content will be sold at $3.99 / €3.99 / ¥500.</p><p><strong>Original Game Soundtrack</strong></p><p>This is an original soundtrack that includes the background music played in the game. Get through the coming summer heat with a spine-chilling horror atmosphere! The price is $ 1.99/ €1.99 / ¥250.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
