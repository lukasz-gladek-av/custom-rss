The developer cited <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-launches-september-4"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>‘s September 4 release</a> and a lack of a <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [361 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> development kit “to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms” as reasons for the delay. <span id="more-987501"></span></p><p>Here is the full message from Aeternum Game Studios on the delay:</p><blockquote><p>Dear community,</p><p>As you know, we’ve been working on Aeterna Lucis for more than four years, our most ambitious project to date. A title that means the world to us and represents the greatest effort of the entire Aeternum Game Studios team.</p><p>Our initial plan was to launch it this September, but after the announcement of [<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>], we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</p><p>In addition, we still don’t have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms. To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That’s why we’ve made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</p><p>The game is already finished, and we will use this additional time to keep polishing it, refining every detail, and making sure it delivers the perfect experience our community deserves. We know this change disrupts many of our strategies, but we are confident that with your support we can overcome this major challenge.</p><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank <a title="Companies > Team Cherry [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-cherry">Team Cherry</a>. There’s no need to wish them luck-we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><p>Thank you for walking this journey with us. 2026 will be a special year, and we can’t wait to live it alongside all of you.</p><p>With all our love,<br>The Aeternum Game Studios Team</p></blockquote><p><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and now presumably, Switch 2.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/aeterna-lucis-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>
