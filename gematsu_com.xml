Yet, you must confront your fears.</p><p><em>Niraya of ■■</em> is a Japanese-style horror <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,602 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that follows Yuni, a child abandoned in a haunted world and searching for a way home.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Late summer, 2000…</p><p>During a ritual held at a remote temple, Yuni loses consciousness, and awakens inside the cold, dark confines of a refrigerator. Outside, the world is unrecognizable—and no trace of Yuni’s mother is to be found.</p><p>Otherworldly horrors lurk the lantern-lined tunnels and temple-like structures. Sensing premonitions moments before danger strikes, it is all Yuni can do to evade and push onward. Relentlessly pursued, Yuni clings to a single hope—to find a way home.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Horror of Being Powerless</strong> – Powerless to strike back against the monsters of this realm, Yuni must utilize premonitions of hostile intent to evade attacks.</li><li><strong>Suspense Through Limited Movement</strong> – Running ahead blindly will leave Yuni exhausted and vulnerable. Suspense heightens with every step, as you carefully manage stamina while making critical decisions.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Sile" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sile">Sile</a>nt and Uncanny World</strong> – Most strangely, this forsaken world does not fall into ruin—as if some unknowable force watches over it. Amidst serene, Buddhist-inspired architecture, something profoundly wrong lingers just beneath the surface.</li></ul><p>Why has Yuni been abandoned in this strange world? As you explore, the truth may come to light, one clue at a time. But, more importantly, it is up to you to guide Yuni safely home.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/niraya-of-%e2%96%a0%e2%96%a0-launches-november-28]]></content:encoded>
