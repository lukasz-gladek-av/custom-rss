With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the <em>Demeo</em> <a title="Genres > Action [2,756 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Roleplaying System.”</p><p>narrative lead Mat Sernett added, “When <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> launched fifth edition back in 2014, the first <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,300 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for <em>Battlemarked</em> players to begin their journey. The first adventure in <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.”</p><div id="carousel_969425"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Resolution Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
