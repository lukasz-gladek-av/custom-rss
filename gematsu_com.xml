With 40 magical runes to combine however you want, every challenge is an opportunity to create your own solution.</p><p><strong>What if Every Puzzle Had Multiple Solutions, and Half of Them Were Things You Invented?</strong></p><p>You start with four runes and collect more as you explore the world of Rhell, using up to five of these in whatever combination you please to solve different puzzles.

        <p><strong>The World’s Gone Quiet</strong></p><p>Everyone has vanished except 12 people, leaving behind empty towns and unanswered questions. As Rhell, a sharp-tongued mage, you explore forgotten ruins filled with ancient secrets, decode mysterious fragments left behind by those who came before, and slowly piece together what really caused this catastrophe. The few remaining inhabitants have their theories, but you might find a truth far stranger than anyone suspected. What started as a simple mystery becomes something that challenges everything you thought you knew.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_983140"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Discover Your Own Path</strong></p><p>Wander through nine distinct areas at your own pace – from flooded libraries and underwater cities to volcanic factories and crystal caves. Each location tells its own story through environmental details and hidden lore, along with characters that have their own mysteries to unravel. Some areas connect in unexpected ways, rewarding those who explore thoroughly. The world doesn’t just contain puzzles, it is a puzzle—one that reveals more of itself the deeper you dig. Whether you’re following the main plot or getting side-tracked by a curious detail, there’s always another secret waiting just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Shape Your Story</strong></p><p>If you choose to help the people you meet along your journey, you might see Rhell’s character develop. Help the lonely characters and watch her soften into someone who genuinely cares. Ignore them entirely and she’ll stay the blunt, loud-mouthed mage she started as. With multiple endings to discover, let your curiosity and kindness (or lack thereof) lead you.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>40 magical runes creating millions of spell combinations (102,400,000 to be exact!).</li><li>Creative ways to solve each puzzle—do it your own way!</li><li>Semi-open world with nine distinct areas to explore.</li><li>Hours of gameplay with endless experimentation and replayability.</li><li>Rich, story driven narrative with branching paths and multiple endings.</li><li>Sarcastic, sassy mage who accidentally helps people while being rude about it.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

We wanted to make a game in which players feel like real investigators of the occult, poring over manuscripts and reference materials by candlelight while the rain beats down outside. We’ve made a game that trusts our players to piece things together for themselves—to delve into the details, to follow the breadcrumbs and to notice what matters. We’re excited for you to play it and discover this cabinet of curiosities for yourselves.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Become the custodian of a store dealing in occult antiquities. Explore the quaint and gloomy town of Undermere, where strange goings-on and dark mysteries abound. Find and identify arcane artefacts, use your collection to aid the townsfolk with their unusual problems — and remember to pet your cat!</p><p><strong>A Note From the Shopkeeper</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>I am pleased to offer you the role of Apprentice Thaumaturge at Strange Antiquities.</p><p>You show promise—a sharp mind and a strong stomach—exactly what this work demands. I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.</p><p>Undermere might seem unassuming at first—a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond—and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.</p><p>Permit me now to outline your duties—you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.</p><p><strong>On Your Duties in the Shop (Gameplay Mechanics)</strong></p><p>Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!</p><ul><li><strong>Study and Identify</strong> – Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.</li><li><strong>Help… Or Hinder</strong> – When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.</li><li><strong>Explore and Discover</strong> – From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumors or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.</li><li><strong>Solve and Uncover</strong> – Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.</li><li><strong>Tending the Familiar</strong> – And, of course, <a title="Companies > Jupiter Corporation [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/jupiter-corporation">Jupiter</a>, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.</li></ul><p><strong>About My Absence (Narrative and Setting)</strong></p><p>These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.</p><p>Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.</p><p>There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.</p><p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p><p>This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.</p><p>I look forward to your arrival.</p><p>Yours,<br>Eli White<br>Thaumaturge &amp; Proprietor<br>Strange Antiquities, Undermere<br>Purveyors of the Arcane Since 1683</p><p><strong>A Note from the Developers</strong></p><p>We are two brothers from the United Kingdom who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!</p><p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.</p><p>We want to thank everyone who has played <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can’t wait to share the next chapter with you.</p><p>Many thanks,<br>Rob and John</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/strange-antiquities-launches-september-17-for-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>
