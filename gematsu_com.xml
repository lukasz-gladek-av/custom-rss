    <p><span>Kickstarter campaign coming soon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Moon Beast Productions" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-beast-productions">Moon Beast Productions</a>, a studio founded by <em>Diablo</em> veterans Philip Shenk, Peter Hu, and Erich Schaefer, has announced <em><a title="Games > Darkhaven" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a></em>, a dark fantasy isometric <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,983 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> that “returns to the genre’s roots while pushing it forward with a fully dynamic, persistent world.” It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced, but it will launch first in Early Access. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> is coming soon. <span id="more-1021761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Moon Beast Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Darkhaven</em> is a dark fantasy isometric action RPG set in the aftermath of a great and final collapse of civilization. <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> empires have fallen, their ruins reclaimed by wilderness, monsters, and predatory supernatural forces. Players are heirs to a legacy of power that is the last hope for this dying world. As eldritch evil worms its way into the world to feed on its remains, it falls to these few to bring the land back from the brink of death.</p><p>Designed for solo play, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,839 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s, and high-stakes player-versus-player-enabled realms, <em>Darkhaven</em> is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world. Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.</p><p>Combat in <em>Darkhaven</em> enhances the balance between stat progression, build choice, and player skill. Heroes can jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> is not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness, dramatically expanding the “action” at the heart of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,946 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a>.</p><p>The game’s itemization and progression philosophy draws heavily on the originators of the action RPG genre, Diablo and Diablo II. Rejecting the incrementalism common in many modern titles, <em>Darkhaven</em> embraces bold, expressive loot—items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021759"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,” said Moon Beast Productions co-founder and chief creative officer Erich Schaefer in a press release. “Movement is fun. Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an action RPG.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and president Peter Hu added, “Great itemization is about possibility. In <em>Darkhaven</em>, we want items that open doors, gear that makes you stop and rethink your build, your strategy, or even how you play the game. Finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and CEO Philip Shenk said, “We’re incredibly excited to finally reveal <em>Darkhaven</em> and open its Steam page. This project represents everything we’ve learned about ARPGs over the last two decades, and what becomes possible when those ideas are combined with modern technology. We’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create. With the community’s support, we’re ready to bring <em>Darkhaven</em> to Early Access, which will allow us to continue to build the game into the incredible experience we all want it to be.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
