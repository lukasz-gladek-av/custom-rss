      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Nacon [250 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Rogue Factor [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/rogue-factor">Rogue Factor</a> have released a seven-minute gameplay video for <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,724 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > Hell is Us [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hell-is-us">Hell is Us</a></em> showcasing its investigation mechanics. <span id="more-980825"></span></p><p>“The dungeons are based on the same philosophy that governs the game, which we call ‘player-plattering,'” said creative and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletete in a press release. “Through this concept, we want players to rediscover the pleasure of exploring on their own, without being hand-held. Within the deep and mysterious confines of each dungeon, the players must pay attention to their environment in order to orient themselves and figure out how to overcome the many obstacles they face.  Each dungeon has its own distinct flavor and memorable moments, culminating in a real sense of achievement once completed.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The story of <em>Hell is Us</em> takes place in Hadea, a fictional country ravaged by a deadly civil war. This hermit nation hides a mysterious past and is home to ancient, forgotten dungeons that players must explore to advance their quest and unravel the secrets of the strange events taking place in the region.</p><p>Far from delivering side content, the dungeons are an integral part of the adventure, providing players with keys to understanding the deep history of Hadea and offering memorable gameplay sequences and challenges.</p><p>Each dungeon is unique in its atmosphere, challenges and meaning. They require players to use different types of skills: interacting and carefully observing their surroundings, using their sense of logic, and above all fighting the many enemies that stand in their way.  What’s more, each of the different dungeons culminates in a final, intense confrontation, leading to revelations that shed light on the tortuous past of this remote corner of the world.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
