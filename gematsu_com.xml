    <p><span>From Paris-based Opus Major.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Opus Major" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/opus-major">Opus Major</a>, a Paris-based studio formed by industry veterans from <a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> and other studios, has announced <em><a title="Games > MAJJAM" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/majjam">MAJJAM</a></em>, a massively multiplayer online player-versus-environment musical <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,387 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> currently in early development. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,632 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845650/MAJJAM/" target="_blank">Steam</a> when it launches, and users can register for an upcoming playtest via the <a href="http://www.majjam.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. <span id="more-977970"></span></p><p>“Our team’s dream is to make the world jam together,” said Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin in a press release. “In music, a jam is a suspended moment—a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there. You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It’s that same spark you sometimes feel in a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [551 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a>. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience.”</p><div id="carousel_977973"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Opus Major:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The rhythm of the world comes alive in <em>MAJJAM</em>, the debut project from the recently announced studio Opus Major: a multiplayer adventure game where music shapes the gameplay, from movement and combat to exploration and interaction. Created by a team of seasoned developers, <em>MAJJAM</em> is a vibrant co-op adventure inspired by the communal creativity of a live jam session, where players can build their own expressive arsenal of melodies, rhythms, and harmonies to explore and rescue a vibrant and ever-evolving world. With music at its core, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers a deeply immersive social experience that celebrates the connective power of both video games and music.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the lively world of <em>MAJJAM</em>, players interact with each other and their surroundings almost exclusively through rhythm and melodies. Music is the world’s life force—a sustaining energy that holds everything together and stands as the only defense against a corruptive presence known as Kode: a dark and encroaching presence pushing fog tides where death and silence rule. Players harness musical energy by Jamming, combining the unique abilities of their character and instruments alongside their allies to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and reshape the world around them.</p><p>The ability to Jam is the main expression of music in-game, giving all players the opportunity to become musicians. The studio’s mission is to make the world jam together, so no instrumental expertise is required to cast melodies and rhythms. Jamming serves multiple functions: fighting back against Kode, exploring and influencing the environment, uncovering and solving puzzles, and more!</p><p>Each character’s special Jam ability is supported and augmented by a system of musical abilities that players will be able to unlock, collect, and store throughout the game. Each ability has a specific musical power that further deepens the player’s skill set and relationship to the world.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Fun and Creativity of Jamming, for Everyone</strong> – <em>MAJJAM</em> captures the joy and spontaneity of a musical jam session, for musicians and non musicians. The game’s technology auto-harmonizes all player performances online, with no noticeable latency. Players collaborate through intuitive gameplay mechanics, not musical skill, making creativity accessible to all. <em>MAJJAM</em> is not a <a title="Genres > Rhythm [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>: it emphasizes communal creation as players express their characters’ musical abilities.</li><li><strong>A Shifting, Musical World</strong> – The vibrant, detailed world of <em>MAJJAM</em> is constantly shifting based on player input: the environment is reacting to player abilities, responding to it, and even opening mysteries. By combining their musical expressions with others, players can reshape part of the world around them, unlocking new areas, discovering powerful melodies, and encountering surprising obstacles.</li><li><strong>A Dynamic and Dangerous Fog System</strong> – Kode isn’t just an antagonist—its power is materialized in the game as a massive environmental threat; a lethal active force that defines the boundaries of exploration. Players can beat back its fog through their musical powers, and explore new zones that used to be restrained under the fog tides.</li><li><strong>Social <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a>s with <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Customization</strong> – Whether you enjoy strumming some chords, hearing delightful woodwind melodies or you’re percussion-addict, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers multiple, colorful character types for players to select, each with their own musical capabilities and distinct look. The key to maximizing their power comes from jamming with others, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [302 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly creating with fellow players to craft a perfect harmony and exponentialize the effects on the world of <em>MAJJAM</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
