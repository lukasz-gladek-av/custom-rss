        <p>The story follows protagonist Yuri Mito, the only son of the local priest at Yachimata Shrine. After a series of events during spring break, Yuri meets Kikuramikami no Hime, the guardian of a mystical relic in the woods near his school. She explains the strained history between humans and the Tayutai, a mythical race sealed within the relic due to their potential threat to humanity. To bridge the gap between their worlds, the goddess reincarnates as a young girl named Mashiro and entrusts herself to Yuri. However, the relic is accidentally destroyed, releasing the Tayutai. Particularly dangerous are the “Three Mightiest,” powerful entities hostile toward humans.</p><p>Armed with spirit powers unique to his lineage, Yuri teams up with Mashiro and three other heroines to explore whether humans and Tayutai can coexist peacefully. This romantic fantasy adventure tells a heartfelt tale of growth, connection, and the mysteries of love.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
