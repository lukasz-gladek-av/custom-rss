It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we’re really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make <em>WarioWare</em> but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”</p><div id="carousel_996988"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Task Time</em> challenges up to eight players to compete across six frantic gameshow-inspired rounds where sabotage is encouraged, friendships are tested, and laughter is guaranteed.</p><!-- AD: content -->

When we started working on <em><a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a></em> in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of an adventurer’s life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With <em>Outward</em> 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our downloadable content. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer’s life. Much better graphics, better immersion and better combat.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nine Dots Studio:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The original <em>Outward</em>, which eclipsed three million players earlier this month, challenged conventional <a title="Genres > Open-World [741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> by trading the typical power fantasy for an adventure that demands preparation, persistence, and tactical execution. <em>Outward 2</em> takes the formula that gathered a dedicated community and injects it with new and enhanced features fueled by the same intention and effort the developers ask of its players as they embark.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>An Average Joe On A Remarkable Journey</strong> – You’re not a hero of legend. Shape your modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, which will determine where to start in this brutal world. Whether you’re a devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon’s Bastion, the world of Aurai will not be kind… not even in defeat. If you’re knocked out, your journey continues, and you must live with the consequences. You could be robbed and left to rot, be saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or… worse.</li><li><strong>A Living, Evolving World</strong> – A full-year seasonal cycle transforms the world of Aurai. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. Comprising of four distinct areas, regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. From the blizzards of the Gilded Mountains to the acid rains in the Gathes of Catharsis, players will find a renewed challenge every time they travel.</li><li><strong>Growth Through <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>tery</strong> – Every factor in <em>Outward 2</em> molds your playstyle. Your tactical choices as a player, from the weight and material of your armor to particular weapons you use, are reinforced by the new <a title="Genres > Exercise [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/exercise">Exercise</a> system, where passive skills will spark and grow based on how you play. Seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai, who will teach you how to survive the most brutal encounters for a fee.</li><li><strong>Ritual Spellcasting and Tactical Combat</strong> – Wielding magic in <em>Outward 2</em> is no mere button press. Cast spells through rituals, like sending a fire stone into the air to create a ring around you that allows you to empower your skills with deadly flames. Challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset, is further enhanced in the sequel with a larger variety of tools and weapon combinations, along with animations that bring more fluidity and control to players. Major combat improvements were cultivated based on extensive player feedback from the original.</li><li><strong>Intentional Inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> -Your backpack is your lifeline, and every space within is worth its weight in gold. Pack provisions, potions, weapons, and camping gear for an expedition, but manage it carefully as you gather more along the way. Some discoveries won’t be worth the precious space. In a fight, you may want to drop your backpack to attack and evade more deftly. The sequel adds a mule you may earn to carry your wares throughout your journey, but its vulnerability may influence your path as well. Weigh each decision carefully.</li><li><strong>Two-Player Split Screen and Online Cooperative</strong> – Aurai is a grueling place, but you mustn’t go alone. Plan and prepare alongside a friend, covering each other’s weaknesses and marrying your strengths. Teamwork expands the opportunities and options for tackling the many challenges you will face in <em>Outward 2</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/outward-2-launches-in-summer-2026]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-996972"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>From the desk of VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the Tyrythian Empire:</p><p>Well this is just complete and utter bullshit.</p><p>Those idiotic, moronic Terranoids think they can just roll in here and take over my beautiful Tyrythian kingdom? The kingdom that I built from the ground up with my bare hands, and only sort of inherited from my dear, sweet, extremely dead father?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Did I mention that this is bullshit?</p><p>It’s fine though, because what they don’t realize is that I am going to make them very, very dead. Along with my trusty sidekick and childhood nursing bot Milky—please do not ask me questions about that—I will whiz over to Earth, turn it into a stinking pile of rubble, and be back home in time for a warm glass of milk before bed.</p><p><em>Earth Must Die</em> is the story of my glorious rise to power (off the back of my adored father’s passing), my subsequent accidental surrender to the Terranoids, and my infamous revenge against Earth and everything it stands for.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_996952"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Apparently the story is retold in the form of one of those old point and click <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> that people gave a shit about in the 1990s, I wanna say? But in 2025. Doesn’t sound like a good idea to me, but what do I know—I’m just a benevolent, terrifying leader of worlds who everyone loves and also super respects.</p><p>I’m also not sure what the phrase “British comedy royalty” is supposed to mean, but I guess they got a bunch of “funny” fuckwits to dub over my glorious voyage to feed the Terranoids their own arseholes? Let me just copy/paste the list here so I don’t have to give them any more time and effort than they deserve:</p><ul><li>Joel Fry – Vvalak Lizardtongue</li><li>Martha Howe-Douglas – Milky</li><li>Alex Horne – Major Haskit, Bentik</li><li>Ben Starr – Krall, Danzan</li><li>Tamsin Greig – Rena, Blorr, Spiffy</li><li>Matthew Holness – Phelonius Skwid</li><li>Mike Wozniak – Willip, Jobson, Druce</li><li>Don Warrington – Quintarian</li><li>Stevie Martin – Skwidbot</li><li>Sophie Duker – Meebap</li><li>Emma Fryer – Parrach, Betsy</li><li>Alasdair Beckett-King – Oogles, Toilet, Vacuum, Village Elder</li><li>Rosie Holt – Chizz, Zarlaph, Karton</li><li>Jon Blyth – Fnaaaarglurp, Olkus</li><li>Julie Nolke – Grace Flufton</li><li>Sam O’Leary – Ian Gard, Ripper</li><li>Tom Lawrinson – Tree, Needledick</li><li><a title="Games > Sally [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sally">Sally</a> Beaumont – Glushh, Big Snake</li><li>David Monteith – Allus, Pfysus, Marvap, Altican, Commandant</li><li>Inel Tomlinson – Cecil, Zertan, Robert Droid, Skwid Guards</li><li>Theo Leslie – Dinny</li></ul><p>How do I not have someone to do this for me? Anyway, apparently my magnificent story is told over a series of many hours, and you click a bunch and things happen and really I don’t care about any of this, I’m just here for the glory.</p><p>You’ll be able to experience my unbelievably cool story through something called “Steam,” which is apparently how you access experiences like this back in 2025. Sounds primitive, but I guess every civilization has to start as gross slugs crawling their way onto the banks of the future.</p><p>VValak signing off.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
