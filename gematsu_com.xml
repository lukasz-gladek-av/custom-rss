These battles may be more challenging than in other modes and have special gameplay experiences unique to this mode, so we definitely encourage you to give it a try.</li><li><strong>Hero’s Diary</strong> – Unlocked after clearing Team Mission. In this mode, you can watch never-before-seen character moments with each other with voice acting that depict the unknown daily lives of the U.A.

From training with Deku and Bakugo to practice exercises featuring unexpected combinations like Mineta, Ashido, and Koda, there are various episodes where you might discover new sides to your favorite characters. By experiencing what may be surprising sides to the characters, we hope you will deepen your own relationship with Class 1-A students, the growth fostered by the Hero Academy, and the world of <em>My Hero Academia</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The trailer also offers a deeper dive into the game’s battle system.</p><!-- AD: content -->
