In addition, the Company has been continuously evaluating capital and business alliances and other partnerships that contribute to discontinuous growth as one measure in response to a global business environment in which IP is rapidly growing in importance.<br>In February 2021, the Company made a new share issuance through a third-party allotment to Sony, with the aim of strengthening the long-term relationship between the two companies. Through this third-party allotment, the Company has worked to enhance its IP “global media mix” by combining global development capabilities of Sony and its affiliates (hereinafter “Sony Group”) in animation and consumer gaming with the Company’s own content, while leveraging the strengths of both companies in terms of business and know-how. As a result of discussions with Sony, it was determined that further strengthening the capital alliance would reinforce and accelerate the “global media mix” strategy with a view to the global market including the construction of a business foundation that will create a more diverse range of IP, further strengthening of development, production and distribution of animation, video games and film, and acceleration of the Company’s ability to expand into merchandising products and music IP, and has entered into the Capital and Business Alliance Agreement with Sony.</li><li data-list-text="2.">Outline of the Capital and Business Alliance<ol><li data-list-text="(1)">Details of the Capital Alliance<br>The Company will issue new shares through a third-party allotment (12,054,100 shares of common stock; percentage of the total number of issued shares after the Third-Party Allotment: 7.83%), and Sony will subscribe for those shares.<br>In addition, Sony has agreed not to transfer the common stock of the Company to any third party for a period of one year from the date the Third-Party Allotment is implemented without the Company’s prior written consent.

In addition to planning and development of large-scale animated series and films, live-action films, drama series, and video games for the global market, and discovery of new creators through expansion of user-generated content (UGC) platforms, the Company also envisages acquiring the content holders including publishers, anime production companies, and game companies in Japan and overseas. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of engaging in collaborations with Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of creating an enriched and unique IPs comprising a diversified portfolio of books, films, anime, games and UGC platforms, and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 20 billion yen for the creation, development and acquisition of new IP.

In addition to this, the Company will work to build a foundation to expand the scope of video game publishing. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of using platforms owned by Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of multimedia deployment since the 1970s originating from its book- to-film adaptations and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 29.7 billion yen to enhance global distribution of its IP.
