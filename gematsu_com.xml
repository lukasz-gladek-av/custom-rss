You are The Cleric, an expert in esoteric events, and a glorified government goon. Inspired by classic CRPG games, Esoteric Ebb features deep and branching dialogs with a staggering amount of choices.</p><p>Create the world’s worst cleric. Take on the city through tense TTRPG dice rolls. Struggle to maintain control with your Stats chiming in at every moment. Let the voices guide you into insane encounters and hit that natural 20 right when you need it. Become the most interesting player at the table and completely ruin your DM’s day.</p><p><strong>Become Lawful Stupid</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Five days until the first-ever election, a tea shop explodes in the heart of the city. They send you to deal with the mess.</p><p>You wake up in a morgue with half the river in your boots, surrounded by ten thousand rotting apples, several corpses, and one zombie. Out of your depth and with no official backup, you delve into your beloved city to investigate the impossible mystery no one wants you to solve. Juggle factions and play them against each other. Explore the streets and tunnels of a fantasy metropolis. Debate devils, drunk sphinxes, and all manner of fantastical fools in a world where mythological creatures sell newspapers at corner shops and ideologies overtake the ramblings of dead gods.</p><p>Don’t forget the most important question: What are you voting in the election?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Make Choices That Will Come Back to Bite You</strong> – Shifting alliances! Risky dungeoneering! Complete open-ended quests, low and high-stakes alike, set in the streets, towers, and dark tunnels of Norvik. Become the city’s savior, its demise, or bumble your way into absolute power.</li><li><strong>Trust the Dice</strong> – Let chance guide you! Roll to wrestle dwarves, steal anything in sight, or to keep yourself from looking like a complete fool. But remember, in true TTRPG fashion, failure can often be way more interesting.</li><li><strong>It’s All in Your Head</strong> – Debate yourself! Each Ability Stat has a conflicting viewpoint and loves to interrupt important conversations. No matter whose side you fall on, you’ll complete quests in wonderfully ridiculous ways.</li><li><strong>Wield Reality-Shaping Magic</strong> – Use The Cleric’s power for unique narrative choices. Control minds for fun and profit. Detect secrets in the tunnels below or in the thoughts of your enemies. Speak with anyone, living or dead, just to see how they insult you.</li><li><strong>Turn-Based Encounters</strong> – Clerics in Norvik are taught to use violence as a last resort. When the need does arise, a roll of the dice determines life or death. But you always have a bizarre solution to any problem, don’t you?</li><li><strong>The <a title="Platforms > Quest [163 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>ing Tree</strong> – Your quest log, skill tree, and mind map all at once. Each Quest Branch can take root in your mind and alter The Cleric’s playstyle through game-changing feats.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Esoteric Ebb | Release Window Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBH69fMyTBg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/esoteric-ebb-launches-in-spring-2026]]></content:encoded>

Among the stars, the planet VESTA is discovered, a world that may hold the promise of a new home. To study it, the A.R.E.S. space station is launched into orbit to analyze its potential. But when the station, and the crew, was caught up in a space phenomenon, calamity struck…</p><p>You play as Miranda, who awakens alone aboard the station trapped in a strange phenomenon. With clues of the past echoing through the world: an object out of place, a door newly unlocked, a message left behind almost as if the station itself challenges you. To survive, Miranda must rely on her mind, solving intricate puzzles, experimenting with strange objects, and piecing together the truth behind what happened to her crew and the station itself.</p><p>As Miranda unravels the mystery, one truth becomes clear: progress always has a cost. Rivage is an atmospheric science-fiction puzzle adventure that blends exploration, logic, and narrative discovery into a deeply beautiful experience, where each step brings you closer to escape.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Immersive World</strong> – Step aboard the A.R.E.S. station, a meticulously detailed, fully interactable environment where every item tells a story. Examine artifacts, analyze research data, and uncover hidden notes scattered across abandoned workstations.</li><li><strong>Captivating Storytelling</strong> – The station was once home to a crew, each with their own goals, fears, and philosophies. Now, only fragments of their lives remain: journals, personal logs, and encrypted messages scattered throughout the station. Piece together their relationships, uncover the emotional toll of isolation, and experience a narrative that weaves scientific mystery with human vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Unravel the <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery</strong> – Every puzzle in Rivage is woven into the fabric of the story. You’ll repair broken systems, realign malfunctioning mechanisms, and solve environmental challenges that play with gravity, magnetism, and the very flow of time.</li><li><strong>The K9 System</strong> – With the K9 System, Miranda can log discoveries and retain certain puzzle solutions, allowing players to focus on what truly matters; uncovering the truth behind the distortions that have consumed the station. This balance keeps gameplay engaging, rewarding cleverness and persistence over repetition.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Rivage World Premiere &amp; Announcement Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLNwBRHVQxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/science-fiction-puzzle-adventure-rivage-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
