      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Renegades</em> expansion will launch on December 2, <a title="Companies > Bungie [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Ash &amp; Iron,” is available today. <span id="more-990781"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em></strong></p><p>Inspired by the legendary <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, “Renegades” merges <em>Destiny</em>‘s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic science-fiction franchise. As the next chapter in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a> Saga, Guardians will experience becoming part of a crew of underdogs rising to challenge a powerful Cabal faction, the Barant Imperium, whom Drifter suspects have a connection to the Nine. Defying the Vanguard, Guardians will pursue Drifter and join a cast of new and returning characters as they navigate a world of shadow to build influence and power.</p><p>During today’s livestream, a newly released ViDoc “Infiltrating the Lawless Frontier” showcased new content arriving with “Renegades.” Highlights include the new Lawless Frontier game mode, new characters, and a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost. Players will unlock upgradeable Renegade abilities unique to Lawless Frontier, earn new weapons and gear, and build reputation with shady Syndicate factions through the Notoriety system to expand their arsenal. Renegades also introduces a new weapon archetype, the Blaster, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and built for <em>Destiny 2</em>. These energy-based weapons draw ammo directly from your reserves and feature a unique heat management system.</p><p>In the Lawless Frontier, Guardians will take on high-risk, high-reward jobs to complete contracts—smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage—either solo or with a fireteam. These missions span three planets and six maps inspired by iconic Star Wars locations. One feature, Invasion, allows players to opt in for additional challenges and rewards by enabling other Guardians to invade the battlefield. This introduces a layer of strategic unpredictability, where greater risk yields greater rewards.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_990782"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition</strong></p><p>The Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition is now available and includes both “The Edge of Fate” and “Renegades” campaigns, The Desert Perpetual raid, and an upcoming new dungeon.

Players who already own the Renegades Standard Edition or the Year of Prophecy Standard Edition can upgrade to the Ultimate Edition, which grants access to all exclusive content and rewards included in the Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition. <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> launches on December 2, 2025.</p><p><strong>Ash &amp; Iron Update</strong></p><p>Today marks the launch of the first major update in the Year of Prophecy, available to all players. “Ash &amp; Iron” brings Guardians back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny to investigate Maya Sundaresh’s experiments. Players will earn exciting new rewards by battling through Reclaim, a new three-player Fireteam Ops activity where Guardians hunt for Golden Age tech and complete evolving objectives against Vex and Cabal forces in a race against time.</p><p>The Rewards Pass for The Edge of Fate has also been refreshed, offering 110 ranks of additional rewards for all players, including a brand-new Strand Exotic Pulse Rifle, an armor ornament set, a Legendary shader, and more.</p><p>On September 27, the Epic raid for The Desert Perpetual will launch with new challenges and rewards for players to chase, offering a fresh twist to Destiny 2’s latest raid. Players who complete The Desert Perpetual Epic raid will unlock a new Bungie Rewards for purchase to be revealed at a later date.</p><p>Additionally, a new Exotic mission is coming on October 7, where players will confront Maya Sundaresh’s Vex and Cabal forces, uncovering new secrets unfolding within an old Warmind bunker.</p><p><strong>Festival of the Lost</strong></p><p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s annual Festival of the Lost event makes its return on October 21, bringing along a host of new weapon holofoils and masks for Guardians to don as they collect candy and pursue ghoulish rewards. Closing out the first major update with Ash &amp; Iron is the new Call to Arms event from November 11 until December 1, available to all players.
