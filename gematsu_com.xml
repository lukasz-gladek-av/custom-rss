    <p><span>Developed by Mighty Yell and 13AM Games. Due out in 2025.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Atari [181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a> and developers <a title="Companies > Mighty Yell [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mighty-yell">Mighty Yell</a> and <a title="Companies > 13AM Games [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/13am-games">13AM Games</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Missile Command Delta [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/missile-command-delta">Missile Command Delta</a></em>, a reimagining of Atari’s 1980s missile defense <a title="Genres > Arcade [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> classic as a turn-based tactical game, for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,056 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-950335"></span></p><p>“While <em>Missile Command Delta</em> approaches gameplay in a completely new way, it retains all the tension and suspense of the arcade original,” said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a press release. “You have to think strategically about every move you make because even one poor choice can have grave consequences.”</p><p>Stearns continued, “<em>Missile Command Delta</em> has a little something for every kind of player—whether you love strategy tactics games, are a mystery fan, a secret hunting completionist, or you just love to explore and solve puzzles. We can’t wait for players to get their hands on the game later this year.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><em>Missile Command Delta</em> reimagines Atari’s 1980s missile defense arcade classic as a turn-based tactical game set against a mysterious narrative that leaves you questioning whether you’re trapped in a simulation or truly defending cities from attack.</p><p>As players explore an abandoned half-century old facility they will encounter locked doors, dishevelled work rooms, massive super computers and newly awakened missile command terminals. Players must defend against waves of missiles from an unknown enemy using a battery of missiles, each with its own unique type, range, and explosion size. Only by managing their arsenal carefully will they have enough firepower to clear the skies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As enemy attacks increase and pressure mounts, relationships will be put to the test, blurring the lines between what is real and who they can trust. If they succeed, they may even learn the truth behind this Cold War defense program.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Missile Command Delta - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qj11h_CjmTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
