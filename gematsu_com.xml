      </p></div><div><p>Rod Fergusson, who <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1953881496013689332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently announced</a> he has left <a title="Companies > Blizzard Entertainment [151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> after five years, has joined <a title="Companies > 2K [671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/2k">2K</a> development subsidiary <a title="Companies > Cloud Chamber [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/2k/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> as the new head of the BioShock franchise, he <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today</a>. <span id="more-985537"></span></p><p>“Would you kindly allow me to share some news?” Fergusson said. “Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new head of the <em>BioShock</em> franchise. I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next <em>BioShock</em> game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development <a title="Companies > Netflix [85 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> movie.”</p><p>Fergusson also confirmed that Cloud Chamber is “restructuring,” following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> from Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier that the studio is laying off an unspecified number of staff.</p><p>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,” Fergusson said. “I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p><p>He continued, “For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</p><p>2K <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/2k-games-opens-new-studio-cloud-chamber-to-work-on-the-next-bioshock-game">announced</a> the opening of Cloud Chamber and a new <em>BioShock</em> game in December 2019. Earlier in August, Bloomberg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lved2wh33k2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Cloud Chamber leadership was changing following a recently failed publisher review, and that an unannounced <em>BioShock</em> remake was also canceled earlier this year.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fergusson’s return to <em>BioShock</em> is notable, as Fergusson was hired by 2K in August 2012 to salvage the then-troubled <em>BioShock Infinite</em>‘s production. In a 2014 report by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/6/5474722/why-did-irrational-close-bioshock-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>, it was said that many employees believed the game would not have shipped without him.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/rod-fergusson-joins-2ks-cloud-chamber-as-head-of-bioshock-franchise]]></content:encoded>
