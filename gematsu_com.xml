Combine unique districts into a vibrant living city and help restore our <em>River Towns</em>.</p><p><strong>Puzzle a River Town</strong></p><p>Each of the three districts has its own set of shapes which are shuffled randomly. This makes every game you play a new and unique puzzle to solve. The different district’s unique and vibrant architecture combines into beautiful little towns along the river. As the town grows, more townspeople move in and bring life back into this old and broken world.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Throughout the game you encounter other objectives, such as gold to collect, trees to regrow and old monuments to rebuild. This turns the difficulty and possibility of collecting points completely upside down.</p><p><strong>Progression</strong></p><p>With every city you piece together, the world becomes a little more verdant. When you complete a level, you will receive a gold, silver or bronze marker, depending on your score.

As night falls, the eerie melodies drift through the deserted corridors, instilling fear in the residents of Florawish. Determined to unveil the truth, Nikki and Momo embark on an expedition into the Queen’s Palace Ruins, where long-buried secrets await discovery.</p><p>Once players complete “The Queen’s Lament” event, the “Queen’s Palace Ruins: Inner Court” dungeon will unlock, offering a new, spine-chilling challenge.

To uncover the cause, they have enlisted a special helper—Nikki! Sign up to help and join the mission to restore Bullquet’s vitality in this wholesome and charming event.</p><p>During the “Eerie Season,” a total of 15 “Revelation Crystals” and the new outfit “Dream Chaser” can be obtained for free.
