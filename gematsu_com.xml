    <p><span>The Blizzard Entertainment celebration returns.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Blizzard Entertainment [150 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has <a href="https://blizzcon.com/" target="_blank">announced</a> BlizzCon 2026, which will run from September 12 to 13, 2026 in Anaheim, California. <span id="more-949301"></span></p><p>The 2026 event will be the first Blizzard Entertainment since BlizzCon 2023, following <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/04/blizzcon-2024-canceled">the cancelation</a> of 2024’s event.</p><p>Here are the first details:</p><blockquote><p>BlizzCon is back! The ultimate celebration of our games and the community that unites us is returning to the Anaheim Convention Center Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, in 2026.</p><p>One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together.</p><p>We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

      </p></div><div><p>The Triple-i Initiative, a showcase event for independent games, will return in 2025 with a new broadcast, organizer <a title="Companies > Evil Empire [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/evil-empire">Evil Empire</a> announced. It will feature world premieres, gameplay reveals, and other surprises from both established names and newcomers. You will be able to watch it on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@iii_initiative" target="_blank"> YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iii_initiative" target="_blank">Twitch</a>. A broadcast date will be announced soon. <span id="more-949256"></span></p><p>The second edition of The Triple-i Initiative will feature <em><a title="Games > The Alters [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > ENDLESS Legend II [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/endless-legend-ii">ENDLESS Legend II</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Enshrouded [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a></em>, <em>No, I’m Not A Human</em>, and more.</p><p>“We’re still newbies in this whole ‘video game showcase business,’ so our goal with the second edition is not to try to fix something that isn’t broken,” said Evil Empire chief operating officer Benjamin Laulan in a press release. “The show was well-received last year so we stuck to the same short and impactful formula while making it bigger and better of course! Players can expect a show packed with back-to-back exciting announcements and… that’s it. No ads, no hosts, no sponsors, just games.”</p><p>Evil Empire marketing director Berenger Dupre added, “This year, Evil Empire doesn’t have a flashy new game to unveil (sorry!), but since we loved making the show we want to keep the party going for everyone anyway. Dropping all these announcements from our corner of the gaming world in one big blast makes sure the entire show is fun to watch for our players, and for us too! We’re very thankful to all our fellow studios who worked with us to make this possible again.”</p><p>If you missed the first edition of The Triple-i Initiative in 2024, catch up on all the announcements <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/tag/the-triple-i-initiative-2024">here</a>.</p><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
