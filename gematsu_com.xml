Set against the popular isekai (otherworld) theme, the story follows a protagonist who, after getting lost, is pulled into a mysterious otherworld. Guided by a “mysterious figure,” the protagonist navigates an unknown and perilous realm, using available resources (cards) to struggle for <a title="Genres > Survival [463 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> in a world filled with danger.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Highly Randomized Game Mechanics</strong><ul><li>In <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, aside from the fixed map background for each chapter, level events, enemy types and quantities, and battlefield setup are entirely randomized. This ensures endless replayability, allowing players to embark on countless unique survival journeys in a near-infinitely varied world!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ever-Changing Terrain and Cards</strong><ul><li>To survive in <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, players must first master the terrain and their cards. On an 8×8 grid, every action can significantly impact the outcome of the game.</li><li>Leverage the environment to set traps for enemies, exploit strategic positioning for hit-and-run tactics to avoid encirclement, and minimize damage in each battle to maximize your chances of survival.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Survive in a <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious Board-Based World Using Diverse Items and Cards</strong><ul><li>In <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, players can choose from various occupations, each with unique cards and rare treasures. Forge your strategy and learn to wield their power to survive. While failure is an expected part of your journey, you can use Soul Orbs earned at the end of each run to enhance your abilities, making complete victory an achievable goal!</li><li>Additionally, players must also carefully study enemy traits and behaviors. While a single enemy may not be too difficult to handle, a group acting together can create overwhelming trouble in an instant! Learning enemy behavior patterns and predicting their actions will greatly enhance a player’s chances of survival.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Running Away Is Not Shameful—It’s Actually Useful</strong><ul><li>Given the scarcity of recovery options, minimizing battle damage is the central focus of <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>. You don’t need to defeat every monster in each chapter. If you’re uncertain about your remaining health, choosing to skip unnecessary battles and head straight for the Boss is a valid tactic—after all, survival is what defines a successful <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>. There are even specific items that allow you to escape non-Boss battles entirely.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>Lost in Fantaland</em> is full of surprises and randomness. Use your cards to craft powerful high-damage or high-defense combos, defeat the otherworldly monsters, and pave your way back home! With repeated challenges, you might even uncover the hidden secrets of this mysterious world—who knows?!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/lost-in-fantaland-for-ps5-ps4-and-switch-launches-october-9]]></content:encoded>
