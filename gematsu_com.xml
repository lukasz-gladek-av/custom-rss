After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios—-Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.</p><p>The development of Monolith’s <em>Wonder Woman</em> video game will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games.</p><p>We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Adapt, upgrade, and fight to protect what little remains.</li><li><strong>Discover</strong> – You are not human, yet you hold their future in your hands. What does it mean to be human? Can life be reborn through synthetic hands? As you explore, you will uncover the last days of Earth—and the truth behind your existence.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Last Caretaker - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0P0twgxYCLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
