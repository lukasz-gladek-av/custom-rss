The console versions will not support cross-play.</p><p>Pre-orders for <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> are currently live, and include the bonus downloadable content “Pet Companions Pack.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Grip Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Land on Icarus, a planet broken due to failed terraforming. Once meant to be humanity’s second home, it is now a hostile frontier of toxic skies, savage wildlife, and relentless storms. Every drop from orbit is a fight for survival. Build shelter, craft weapons, hunt for food, and seek your fortune in exotic matter.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Survive alone or with up to four players in this uncompromising player-versus-environment survival game from the creator of <em>DayZ</em>.</p><p>The “New Frontiers” expansion is included from the start, transforming <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> into a larger, deadlier but more rewarding survival experience. Discover new maps, missions, creatures, and rewards.</p><p><strong>A Planet That Fights Back</strong></p><p>Icarus resists your presence; poisoned air, lightning storms that tear apart structures, wildfires that spread unchecked, and predators that stalk in the shadows. It feels like the planet itself wants to drive you back into orbit.</p><ul><li>With New Frontiers added from the start, you can explore two 64 km2 maps of handcrafted terrain across forests, mountains, deserts, and caves.</li><li>Harvest every tree, rock, and creature.</li><li>Adapt to extreme weather and natural disasters.</li></ul><p><strong>“New Frontiers” Included</strong></p><p>The Prometheus region, once sealed off by the UDA, is now open. Terraforming failed here completely, leaving raw alien landscapes intact but warped. This expansion expands Icarus far beyond its original borders:</p><ul><li><strong>New Map and Biomes</strong> – Alien grasslands, volcanic wastelands of molten lava, and dangerous swamplands.</li><li><strong>Six Narrative Missions</strong> – A chained story across Prometheus as you pursue a mysterious whistleblower for the UDA.</li><li><strong>New <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Face Needlers, Dracs, Dreadwings, and other mutated apex predators, evolved to dominate these zones.</li><li><strong>New Exotics</strong> – Discover a volatile new exotic with unique effects on the flora, plus new exotic plants and over 30 additional workshop items.</li><li><strong>New Items and Resources</strong> – Mine obsidian, clay, scoria, crystallised miasma, and super-cooled ice; craft 100+ new items including weapons, food, recipes, and building tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Three Ways to Survive</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World</strong> – Establish permanent bases and explore freely.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Timed contracts where extraction is everything.</li><li><strong>Outposts</strong> – Low-pressure zones for creative building and experimentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Progression and Reward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tech Tree and Talents</strong> – Advance from primitive tools to advanced tech.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> – Focus as a hunter, builder, or survivalist.</li><li><strong>Orbital Workshop</strong> – Trade exotic matter for permanent upgrades and equipment. Exotic matter remains the ultimate prize; rare, unstable, and deadly to pursue.</li></ul><p><strong>Solo or Cooperative Play</strong></p><p>Up to four players can share each drop, combining skills and resources to endure. Prefer to go it alone? Survive solo with a Solo Talent Tree for maximum challenge.</p><p>(Note: <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> does not support cross-play.)</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Console Edition</em> Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition Launches 26.02.26 | Pre-order Bonus Revealed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GTFL29dXa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/icarus-console-edition-launches-february-26]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Coffee Stain Publishing [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/coffee-stain-publishing">Coffee Stain Publishing</a> and developer Easy Trigger Studios have announced <em><a title="Games > HUNTDOWN: OVERTIME [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/huntdown-overtime">HUNTDOWN: OVERTIME</a></em>, a “grindhouse <a title="Genres > Roguelite [329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite</a> prequel” to the <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,380 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> <em>Huntdown</em>. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q2 2026. <span id="more-1022448"></span></p><p>“<em>OVERTIME</em> is a very different game from the original <em>Huntdown</em>,” said <a title="Companies > Easy Trigger Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/easy-trigger-games">Easy Trigger Games</a> art director Tommy <a title="Companies > Gust [816 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a>afsson in a press release. “We’ve tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick. Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coffee Stain Publishing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Corporations turned <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e-infested streets into profit margins for bounty hunters and John Sawyer is going to make a killing. Hunt, die, upgrade, repeat in this explosive roguelite prequel where every strategic upgrade strips away more flesh and builds a cybernetic fighter one chrome limb at a time.</p><p><strong>Combat and Runs: Die Hard, Hunt Harder</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fast, violent run-and-gun action ripped straight from VHS-era blockbusters. Tight controls meet brutal firefights in a roguelite loop designed for pure adrenaline. Collect bounties and survive as long as you can. When you finally go down, Tony drags you back to his operating table and rebuilds you stronger.</p><p>Every run pushes you deeper into dangerous gang turf—from neon-soaked city streets to desolate wastelands. Choose your path, lock in on your targets, and adapt on the fly. Each death teaches you the patterns, each resurrection makes you deadlier. This is John Sawyer’s origin story: the transformation from man to cybernetic legend.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022452"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Weapons and Upgrades: Build the Perfect Killer</strong></p><p>Crank up the heat with a powerful arsenal of firearms, melee weapons and tactical gear. And if heat isn’t your thing, go for a cryomod and let an electric baton do the rest.</p><p>Discover cybernetic upgrades and weapon licenses buried in enemy territory. Make your upgrades permanent by unlocking them between runs and reshape how Sawyer fights. Reinforced limbs and experimental combat mods—hundreds of combinations to forge Sawyer into the killing machine that fits your style.</p><p>Each run offers fresh opportunities. Bank your earnings, invest in permanent enhancements, then jump back in with new capabilities. Adapt your approach: go loud with heavy firepower or slice through with bladed brutality. The city’s scum won’t know what hit them.</p><p><strong>Handcrafted Pixel Art Visuals</strong></p><p>Meticulous pixel art meets modern lighting in a stunning collision of retro craft and contemporary technique. This is pure early-80s B-movie aesthetics—bold reds on deep black and explosive contrasts. No pretty neon nostalgia, just VHS-era swagger.</p><p>Welcome to the grindhouse. Welcome to Overtime.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
