    <p><span>PC version due out on December 9.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Following its December 9 launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, Soulslike <a title="Genres > Deckbuilder [125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/deckbuilder">deckbuilder</a> <em><a title="Games > Death Howl [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-howl">Death Howl</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,986 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,398 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,064 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on February 19, 2026, publisher <a title="Companies > 11 bit studios [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> and developer <a title="Companies > The Outer Zone [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-outer-zone">The Outer Zone</a> announced. It will also be made available via Game Pass on the same day. <span id="more-1011898"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via 11 bit studios:</p><blockquote><p>Blending beloved mechanics into something entirely its own, <em>Death Howl</em> is a genre-defying Soulslike deckbuilder that tells the story of Ro, a mother from a shamanic tribe, who refuses to accept the loss of her child. In a desperate act, she descends into the spirit world to fight for a second chance.</p><p>Minimalist in presentation but unafraid of raw, harrowing themes, <em>Death Howl</em> unfolds as a metaphorical journey through sorrow, <a title="Genres > Survival [490 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and acceptance. It’s a hunt where every step forward carries a cost—and every enemy demands a study worthy of a huntress.</p><p>True to soulslike tropes, defeat is not the end, but part of the learning path. Resting revives fallen foes, and understanding enemy behavior is crucial to progress. <em>Death Howl</em> enhances this structure with tactical, grid-based combat, deck-building systems, and action-RPG exploration across eerie, hostile biomes.</p><p>Each region introduces not just new enemies and active and passive abilities, but also new cards that offer deck-tailoring possibilities, allowing players to shape their tactical approach as they progress. Every fallen spirit adds to Ro’s strength in this quiet war of grief and resolve.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Will Ro reclaim what was taken from her? Or will the spirit world take her too?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p><h2><span>PC Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Death Howl | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7J4c7mzP2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>11 Facts Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Death Howl | 11 Facts Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Jonqy6BS9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/death-howl-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-launches-february-19-2026]]></content:encoded>
