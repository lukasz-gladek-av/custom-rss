Discover what happened to Cosmopolis and our hero, and make an important choice!</li><li><strong>New Rooftops</strong> – Remember all those “coming soon” zones? Well now you’ll be able to visit all the rooftops you’ve been curious about. Plus we’ve added several bigger new locations!</li><li><strong>The Carnival</strong> – We know you’ve all been eagerly waiting to visit The Carnival since we last showed it off, and it will finally be accessible with this new update.</li><li><strong>A New Friend</strong> – In the last update, we introduced the relationship system with characters, and of course, we’ve added a new character in version 1.0! Meet Bombshell Barbara—a woman with an explosive personality who needs your help. Befriend her, help her work through her problems, and she’ll make sure nobody messes with you!</li><li><strong>Smart Tower Levels</strong> – We’ve added level three and level four of the Smart Tower, meaning you can now travel to every corner of Cosmopolis and and visit all those previously locked locations! You’ll also be able to unlock new upgrade modules, including the weather control module, solar generator, and battery upgrades, and don’t forget the enhancements for minions, batteries, and tools. Get ready to explore!</li><li><strong>Resource Progression</strong> – As technology advances, so do production methods. We’ve added a third level for the press, along with Nano-Forge—a new structure where you can create entirely new materials like techno-wood, tungsten, carbon, and reactors! And, of course, you can finally now fully upgrade all your tools to the max level!</li><li><strong>Teleports</strong> – The rooftop was already pretty big and now it’s even bigger. Moving around has become a real issue, but we have a solution: teleportation. Place one here, place another there, and voila! Mow no one will be able to keep up, except maybe the game camera.</li><li><strong>Farming, Fishing, and <a title="Genres > Cooking [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a></strong> – New plants and crops have arrived: cream beans and noodle grass. And you thought the cheese tree was the height of Cosmopolis agriculture? You can now upgrade the fishing rod to level three to catch four new delightful post-apocalyptic fish. And with all these new ingredients, we’re thrilled to announce the arrival of the fourth and final level of the kitchen, along with dozens of new recipes for you to try.</li><li><strong>Progression</strong> – We’ve added all the missing structure levels :level two and three for the cultivator and UV tower, level three for the biogenerator crypto farm and anti-infection spray, and, of course, level four for the barricade.</li><li><strong>Recycling</strong> – A few words about our latest addition: recycling. We’ve expanded resource recycling in the game with dismantling options now available on the workbench, farmer’s table, and synthesizer including level two and level three. All your “spam” resources (we promised we didn’t mean for them to be spam) are now integrated into the broader resource system. Pre-created resources can now also be broken down into their components.</li></ul><p>Don’t worry we’re not stopping here, we will continue improve the game as we’re already getting started on the next update for you. After all who said that version 1.0 was the end? We want to thank you for your constant trust and support whilst we’ve been developing this game. Early Access was a huge experience for us and we’re glad we didn’t disappoint, bringing the game into its full release! Mark your calendars! On November 13, 2024, we will return to Cosmopolis in a whole new way! See you in the future!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

This is a great opportunity for Infogrames to publish a successful game and help continue to grow its loyal fan base by expanding distribution. We are looking forward to continuing to work with Sand Castles Studio to support <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em>‘s long term development plans.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Infogrames:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is a casual but challenging cooperative platformer where players must work together to help two cute and funny penguins, Bread and Fred, jump and climb to the top of a snowy mountain. The title has gained a loyal following as much for its ability to reduce friends to a fit of giggles or tears as for its unique gameplay mechanics, adorable characters and friendly NPCs.</p><p>Players steer the penguin pals through an exasperating and sometimes maddening climb that requires precision with every jump. Tethered together, the characters can use their momentum to swing each other onto higher and higher ledges. But forget to anchor and if one falls they will pull the other down with them.</p><p>Solo players make their way up the mountain as Greg, who must use a rock on a rope (named Jeff), instead of a penguin pal, to swing his way uphill.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
