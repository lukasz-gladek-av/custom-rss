Cooperative play has long been one of the most requested features from the community, and this update opens the game to shared exploration, collective survival, and new ways to play, while staying true to its original base game DNA. To make cooperative play work, key systems from the base game are being re-done such as time mechanics during crafting, gathering, building as well as adapting main features like combat, and revival specifically for multiplayer.</p><p>The update will be available for free on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, Humble) as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series in 2026. The base game is currently priced at $27.99 / €27.99 on PC and $29.99 on console with the Captain’s Edition.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/twin-sails-interactive-announces-first-wave-of-2026-publishing-lineup]]></content:encoded>
