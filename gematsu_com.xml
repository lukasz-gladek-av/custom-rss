It will launch on September 30. <span id="more-964091"></span></p><p>The game will be available in the following two editions:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Edition</strong> ($29.99)<ul><li>Base game</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> ($39.99)<ul><li>Base game</li><li>Blue Camo armor skin</li><li>Blue Camo weapon skin</li><li>“The Art of <em><a title="Games > Alien: Rogue Incursion [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a></em>” digital in-game art book</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        </li></ul><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Survios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the universe of the <em>Alien</em> films like never before: re-envisioned for console and PC. An all-new <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-horror entry into the classic franchise, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> transforms you into Zula Hendricks—the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani’s blacksite experiments—on a dangerous mission to investigate an SOS from the backwater planet Purdan, home to a long-defunct mining colony. With her ever-present synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled <a title="Genres > Stealth [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and serious firepower at her disposal. With deeply personal stakes propelling both Zula and Davis deeper, they must plunge to the dark heart of Purdan to expose—but not unleash—the horrors lurking within.</p><p><strong>Part One of a Two-Part Story</strong></p><p>Zula’s Fight Begins Here: Part One of this gripping two-part story thrusts you into the violent world of <em>Alien</em>, where you will uncover the secrets lurking within the GES facility on LV-354, the enigmatic planet Purdan. This installment stands alone as a complete story yet leaves you hanging on a thrilling cliffhanger, eager to dive deeper into Zula’s unfolding story in Part Two, where she will face new challenges and deadlier enemies.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Evolved <em>Alien</em> Combat</strong> – Battle Xenomorphs who behave just like their cinematic counterparts: actively hunting you throughout locations, climbing and crawling on walls and ceilings, stealthing through ducts and tunnels, and jumping on objects within the world.</li><li><strong>Explore to Survive</strong> – With the facility destroyed, resources like ammunition and health supplies are limited, so you’ll have to scrounge and scavenge to stay stocked. That means searching every possible room, closet, and corner, where more than just supplies are hiding.</li><li><strong>Authentic <em>Alien</em> Atmosphere</strong> – Drop directly into the world of the <em>Alien</em> films as you become ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks on a deadly mission featuring characters, environments, weapons, enemies, and stakes from the classic franchise, all within a gripping new story that sets you at the center of the action.</li><li><strong>Spatial Sound Design</strong> – With Xenomorphs lurking everywhere, you’ll most likely hear them before you see them. Stay frosty; that hissing sound could be a Xenomorph or a burst pipe. Spatial sound alerts you where they’re stalking, but your <a title="Genres > Survival [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is up to you.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

    <p><span>New window set after missing winter release.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>With winter over and spring in effect, publisher <a title="Companies > THQ Nordic [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic">THQ Nordic</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Grimlore Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic/grimlore-games">Grimlore Games</a> have officially delayed the Early Access launch of <em><a title="Games > Titan Quest II [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/titan-quest-ii">Titan Quest II</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,086 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> from its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/titan-quest-ii-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-this-winter">previously planned</a> winter release to summer. A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-964064"></span></p><p>Here is an message from THQ Nordic:</p><blockquote><p>Originally slated for a winter 2024 / 2025 release, <em>Titan Quest II</em> will now launch in Early Access in summer 2025. The decision comes in response to a crowded <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves.</p><p>The team at Grimlore expressed deep gratitude for the overwhelming response to their recent demo playtest. With thousands of players participating, streaming, and filling out surveys, over 92 percent rated their experience as positive or very positive. Particularly encouraging was the feedback from long-time <em>Titan <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a></em> fans, who praised the game for capturing the spirit of the original while pushing forward with modernized systems.</p><p>Players explored the game’s introductory chapter, choosing from dual <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>teries and facing off against the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible—a fight that turned out to be a fan favorite. Visuals and audio received standout marks, with average scores of 5.25 out of 6 and 5.16 out of 6 respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p><p>That said, the team acknowledges areas that need refinement. Combat fluidity, ability aiming, and balance are already being addressed, and performance optimizations will continue. New improvements, including customizable control schemes and enhanced UI indicators, are already underway based on community suggestions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Grimlore Games reaffirmed their commitment to delivering a true successor to <em>Titan Quest</em>, one that respects its legacy while evolving for a new generation of players. The developers are actively implementing feedback and fine-tuning features ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
