            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Xbox Game Studios [954 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> and developers <a title="Companies > Team NINJA [658 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/team-ninja">Team NINJA</a> and <a title="Companies > PlatinumGames [486 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/platinumgames">PlatinumGames</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > NINJA GAIDEN 4 [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">NINJA GAIDEN 4</a></em> downloadable content “The Two <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ters,” which is due out in early 2026. It is included as part of the Deluxe Edition and Deluxe Upgrade. <span id="more-998236"></span></p><p>“So ‘The Two Masters’ [downloadable content], which will be available in early 2026, contains new weapons for Yakumo and Ryu,” explained Team NINJA director Masakazu Hirayama in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGrGeUYAeA&amp;t=1130s" target="_blank">Official Xbox Podcast video</a>. “And you can see from the key visual, that Yakumo’s new weapon captures his personality and his approach to combat with, you know, his expressive abilities. Whereas Ryu’s weapon, as you can probably glean from the key visual, has a more precise look to it and will allow you to perform powerful and high speed abilities. Each of these weapons will have its own distinct qualities and a plethora of mechanics for players to dig into. So, we invite players to look forward to it.”</p><p>Hirayama continued, “In addition to, these weapons, there’s also going to be new story content that’s included in ‘The Two Masters’ [downloadable content]. And the story content takes place after the events of the base game and unfolds from the perspective of both of these characters. In addition to the story content, there will also be post game challenge content that exists separate from the Ninja Trials that are in the base game. So there is a lot of content, for players, to dig into. And we can’t wait to share more details with players as they become available.”</p><p><em>NINJA GAIDEN 4</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,556 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,046 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,464 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a> on October 21.
