The team has pulled out all the stops for Wrath of the Ancients. They’ve excelled themselves over the course of development, <a title="Genres > Crafting [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> stunning content for players all around the globe. I can’t wait to see what fans think of it.”</p><p>Schade added, “The German video game industry remains strong, supported by generous grants from the German government to create a level playing field to countries that have had tax break programs for decades. These grants help create jobs and fund creative projects that showcase German technical and expertise across many game genres. I hope to see programs like this continue as they do an excellent job supporting especially small and mid-sized studios all over the country to stay fully independent. A program that has become even more important with the ongoing lack of industry funding for new projects.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via ROCKFISH Games:</p><blockquote><p>“Wrath of the Ancients” continues the <em>EVERSPACE 2</em> story, adding new star systems to explore and expanding existing star systems with new side quests.</p><p>Players will be able to pilot a new ship to battle against alien enemies and ancient threats in an all-new story set after the events of <em>EVERSPACE 2</em>. Mysterious attacks have laid waste to human settlements in Cluster 34, destabilizing factions in power and stranding survivors. With this destruction, the uneasy peace between humankind and Okkar is threatened—space pilots will venture into the Okkar Homeworlds to discover the truth behind the threat before war reignites the DMZ.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During the events of Wrath of the Ancients, warp gates open to four new fully explorable star systems including the Okkar homeworlds and Aethon, adding even more secrets throughout Cluster 34.
