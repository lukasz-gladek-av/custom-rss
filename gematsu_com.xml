Not suitable for persons under 16 years of age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Brief Outline of the Game</strong></p><p>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</p><p><strong>Content Specific Issues</strong></p><p>This game features depictions of the use of illegal drugs. During a party scene, the player is offered wine and is given the option to take a sip. The player character realizes that she has been spiked from the drink that she sipped on and is experiencing hallucinations. Images on screen become distorted and a scene plays out with the character seeing strange images. A character tells the hallucinating character that she is “tripping balls.” It is then explained that she is high on mushrooms. There are also depictions of strong, realistic violence. In the opening scene, the game recaps the previous games from the series which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso before she is then seen lying on the ground with blood seeping through her shirt. Much of the violence in the game is implied; a building is set on fire and people are heard inside screaming for help. This game also contains the use of strong language, including ‘fuck.’ Milder bad language is also present, including ‘asshole,’ ‘piss,’ and ‘shit.’</p><p><strong>Other Issues</strong></p><p>This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items in the form of new outfits and a digital deluxe upgrade, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers, or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are images in the game which may be scary to younger players, including scenes of dead bodies with no blood or injury detail and human skeletons. Some sexual innuendo is found in the game. When the player goes to a party, another character tells them that someone didn’t show up as their “girlfriend thought this was an orgy.” Suicide is referenced in the game frequently, but no depictions are shown.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q6nkau/new_possible_life_is_strange_game_leaked_life_is/" target="_blank">r/GamingLeaksandRumours</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe]]></content:encoded>
