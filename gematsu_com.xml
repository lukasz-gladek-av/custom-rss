So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more—if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually…,’ everyone would be really surprised! (Laughs.)</p><p>“So yeah, things are moving along really smoothly, and the release timing has already been decided. We’re moving forward according to that schedule right now, so please rest assured and be patient.</p><p>“And this has also come up in the comments here and there, but <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p><p>An official title, platforms, and a release date for the third entry in the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> series have yet to be announced.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>, which was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/04/kingdom-hearts-iv-announced">announced</a> in April 2022, shared <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/kingdom-hearts-iv-new-screenshots">new screenshots</a> in May.
