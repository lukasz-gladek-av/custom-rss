It will launch in 2025 with English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese language support. <span id="more-935822"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Industry veteran Yukito Urushibara and prolific illustrator Saine join forces for the first time to craft a stunning tale about a group of young people in an eerie world of endless twilight. Follow their story as they struggle against limitless cruelty and confront the inescapable traumas of life and death together.</p><p><em>Perennial Dusk: Kinsenka</em> is the latest visual novel written by Yukito Urushibara, whose work on <em>Irotoridori no Sekai</em> and <em>Sakura Moyu</em> captivated players with stories that inspire hope as readily as they induce despair.</p><p>The cast of colorful-yet-broken characters is brought to life by Saine, whose experience as the illustrator of various Vocaloid music videos (“mikitoP “Kunoichi demo Koi ga shitai”) and as a VTuber designer (“Kamishiro Kurea,” “Watagashi Unou,” “Hoshikage Lapis,” and “Kozuya Nano” among others) lets the delicate twilight world bloom with a resplendent touch.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The human heart is but a vessel for pain.</p><p>That’s what someone once whispered-a voice laced with loneliness, whispering directly into the soul. It’s an indescribable sadness, a love just beginning to bloom. It becomes an invisible pain that pierces the heart. And that’s what makes up life: a cyclical series of highs and lows.</p><p>Tachibana Sai was born without the ability to feel pain in his heart. He spends his days eliminating any seeds of malice that sneak up on his sister, the one person he treasures, without drawing attention to himself.</p><p>Sick of the never ending monotony he lives through, he chances upon a meeting with Benio Matsuri, a young girl whose aloof demeanor resembles that of a beautifully crafted doll.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he encounters a heart piercing sensation that of falling in love.</p><p>On the edge between day and night, in a twilight world where the dead and living mingle, stands an apartment building called Maison sans Nom, which is home to a group of boys and girls.</p><p>A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body.</p><p>This ill-assorted group of residents, hands stained with blood from battling the supernatural Maledicts, shall encounter the hearts they never knew and begin nurturing their souls.</p><p>The human heart is hut a vessel for pain.</p><p>To protect this pain akin to love… To gently break the world apart, piece by piece… Even if it means abandoning humanity. That’s why the heart is but a vessel for pain.</p><p>For life blazes brilliantly, while the heart goes around in an endless cycle.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Matsuri</strong></a> (voiced by <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ka Iwami) – A girl born into the Benio Family, a powerful family of Maledict Exorcists, who is tightly bound by her family’s curse. Due to an incident in the past, causing her to close off her heart, she doesn’t speak and barely shows any emotion. Her eyes remain closed at all times, as if she wishes to isolate herself from the cruel world she lives in. Since she only moves when someone pulls her along by the hand, her demeanor evokes the image of a beautifully crafted doll. She is a Curse Bearer with the ability to give Maledicts form and use their powers freely.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nobody</strong></a> (voiced by Manaka Iwami) – Another personality that dwells inside Benio Matsuri’s heart that appears when Matsuri is asleep. Nobody sees herself as a shield that protects Matsuri from the cruel world. She can be incredibly selfish, and her words, <a title="Genres > Action [2,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and strong attitude cause her to come across as a haughty, ill-mannered girl.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tachibana Sai</strong></a> (voiced by Yumiri Hanamori) – The protagonist of the story: A ruthless boy who cannot feel pain in his heart. His younger sister, his only family, is the one person he treasures, and anyone who torments her is met with a brutal end by his hands… Yet, yearning to understand the human heart, he often interrogates his victims, even though they cannot respond. Just as he begins to seek respite from his bleak life, his unexpected encounter with Benio Matsuri causes him to experience a kind of pain akin to love in his heart.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kanbara Tatsuki</strong></a> (voiced by Shuta Morishima) – An earnest and sincere boy who was born with a body that doesn’t feel any physical pain. Despite the unjust world around him, he wishes to keep on the straight and narrow, even if no one else does. He began training at a young age under a master who claimed to be invincible in order to become… well, a certain something. He has infiltrated the Benio Family and is biding his time for the chance to free Benio Matsuri, his first love, from their curse.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tsukahara Ao</strong></a> (voiced by Hitomi Sasaki) – A seemingly cheerful and sociable resident of Maison sans Nom. She’s especially close with her friend Ando Mémé. Born as a Curse Bearer, she works as one of the Benio Family’s mercenaries and exorcists. On top of her mischievous tendencies, she wants more than anything to be a housewife. Her <a title="Genres > Cooking [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> might not be up to par now, but she’s working on it.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ando Meme</strong></a> (voiced by Hika Tsukishiro) – A surly resident of Maison sans Nom and a Curse Bearer like Ao. Despite her ambitious and hard-working nature, she tends to scare people off due to her prickly attitude. However, she is keener than anyone when it comes to helping her friends, and Ao is especially reliant on her companionship. Her goal in life is to rake in the money as a top-grade exorcist.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kirishima Tsuyu</strong></a> (voiced by Yukina Shuto) – The landlord of Maison sans Nom. Tsuyu is obsessed with his own cuteness and habitually declares himself the cutest person in the world. He enjoys teasing the other residents, and while they get annoyed with Tsuyu’s antics sometimes, they still adore him. He often earns himself a spanking from Yozora. He is also a content creator who makes full use of his looks while livestreaming as “Chuyu.” He has a preference for strong-willed people and takes a particular liking to Tatsuki in this regard. A Curse Bearer like Ao and Mémé, he possesses a mysterious power.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kandori Yozora</strong></a> (voiced by Hana Kuga) – As the only grown-up resident of Maison sans Nom, Yozora acts as the guardian of the younger residents. She appears to be a beautiful, classy lady… until she opens her mouth. With her frank and outspoken attitude, as well as her tendency to drink cheap booze, gamble on horses, and “borrow” money from the kids without ever returning it, she’s not exactly what one would consider a responsible adult. Yozora does not possess any Maledict powers, but she prides herself on being the strongest martial artist in the world.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Tsui</strong></a> (voiced by Takako Tanaka) – The current head of the Benio Family and Matsuri’s younger sister. Contrary to her appearance as a young girl, she considers herself the matriarch of the family, referring to all its members as her “children,” regardless of blood relations. Inside her heart dwells three different personalities, each with their own quirks and caprices. All are cold, cruel, and ruthless by nature, although she sometimes displays a child-like innocence befitting her age.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Penguin</strong></a> (voiced by Reika Fujisawa) – A mysterious, smartly dressed penguin with the ability to understand and speak human language. However, it is painfully shy, so normally it pretends to be just a regular penguin. It works as a receptionist and bellhop at a hotel where the souls of the dead end up, so the younger residents of Maison sans Nom refer to it as “God.” It has a huge attitude for a cute little penguin and is extremely hard to please. The best way to buy its favor is with sweets and snacks.</li><li>…and others!</li></ul><p><strong>Main Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning / Story:</strong> Yukito Urushibara</li><li><strong>Character Design / Art:</strong> Saine</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Frontwing</li><li><strong>Background Music:</strong> Fuminori Matsumoto, Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul><p><strong>Theme Song</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> “Anata no Kioku no Naka de” (“In Your Memories”)</li><li><strong>Vocals:</strong> Mao Uesugi</li><li><strong>Lyrics:</strong> Yoshikazu Kuwashima</li><li><strong>Composition and Arrangement:</strong> Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="【PV】漆原雪人×さいね『花束を君に贈ろう-Kinsenka-』ビジュアルノベルゲーム2025年発売" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHQekt3inMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Mavuika and Citlali join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Incandescent Ode of Resurrection,” will launch on January 1, 2025, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-935765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update will finally make Mavuika, the Pyro Archon, playable. The Traveler will join Mavuika and Natlan’s warriors in a fateful battle in the newest Archon Quest. In addition, players can revisit Liyue during Lantern Rite, celebrating Teyvat’s new year with bounteous rewards, including Intertwined Fates ×10, Primogems ×1,600, a free 4-star Liyue character and more.</p><p>The final battle tolls its bell, summoning Natlan’s warriors to rise in the new Act V of Natlan’s Archon Quest. In the previous main story, the six heroes of Natlan successfully united, and the sacred blessing of the Ode of Resurrection was extended to all Natlanese warriors. At long last, the Traveler is on the verge of awakening their Pyro power. Meanwhile, the Abyss will unleash a new evil into the world for the final showdown, the terrifying Abyssal Mimic Dragon, a Boss known as the “Lord of Eroded Primal Fire”.</p><p>Revered as Natlan’s most radiant protector during the Abyss wars, Mavuika, also known as the Pyro Archon Haborym, joins the battlefield with two unique combat styles: Fighting with her claymore, or crushing opponents while riding her Flamestrider. By tapping her Elemental Skill, the Ring of Searing Radiance manifests, following Mavuika or the active character and unleashing continuous Pyro attacks. By holding her Elemental Skill, Mavuika mounts her Flamestrider, allowing her to scale cliffs, drive across land and water alike, glide in mid-air, and charge into opponents in her path. By fighting alongside her teammates, Mavuika gains a unique resource called Fighting Spirit, used to activate her Elemental Burst. Her Elemental Burst unleashes a powerful AoE Pyro attack, and Mavuika will enter a special state with higher interruption resistance and enhanced combat power. Additionally, Mavuika can decrease the party’s Nightsoul Transmission Cooldown by 20%. Players can learn more about this stalwart warrior in her Story Quest, which unlocks after completing the latest Archon Quest.</p><p>In contrast to Mavuika’s blazing flames, “Granny Itztli,” otherwise known as Citlali from the Masters of the Night-Wind, brings a biting cold to the battlefield as a 5-star Cryo Catalyst user. A powerful Shaman revered by her tribe, Citlali is always accompanied by two little companions, Itzpapa and Citlalin. During exploration, they transform into cushions and pillows, allowing Citlali to comfortably float in mid-air. While in combat, Citlali can deploy Cryo shields and summon a powerful Cryo storm of AoE DMG with her little companions. While in her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, “Granny Itztli” lowers the Pyro and Hydro RES of opponents affected by Frozen or Melt reactions, even when Citlali is off-field. Both Mavuika and Citlali debut in the first half of Version 5.3’s Event Wishes, with reruns for Arlecchino and Clorinde arriving in the second half.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_935766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>A new Liyue character, Lan Yan, debuts as a 4-star Anemo Catalyst user in the second half of Version 5.3. One of her inherited Qimen Arts is the Swallow-Wisp Shield that can convert its Element into Hydro, Pyro, Cryo or Electro to absorb corresponding Elemental DMG. After the conversion, she can also leap into the air to attack, dealing the same type of Elemental DMG to her opponents. In addition, more 5-star characters will return in another round of Chronicled Wish, including Ganyu and Shenhe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bustling Liyue Harbor is once again aglow with the cheer of Lantern Rite. Players can share in the festive joy through various free rewards, including Primogems ×1,600 and the new glider “Wings of Fate’s Course Intertwined” via in-game mails, Intertwined Fate ×10 through a daily login event, a free 4-star Liyue character by completing the Lantern Rite event, and a new outfit for Xiangling by accumulating Festive Fever in the event.</p><p>Besides the joy of reaping rewards, mini-games and events will be adding another layer of excitement to the festivities. This year, players can share their customized gift envelopes with companions and other Travelers, weaving their best wishes and sentiments into their works. They can also play the block clearing mini-game, “Immortal Combat,” as well as a combat challenge with Stratagem buffs to accumulate fun and Festive Fever alike. Once Festive Fever reaches a certain level, players can claim Xiangling’s new outfit “New Year’s Cheer” and more celebratory bonuses for free. Meanwhile, Hu Tao’s new outfit “Cherries Snow-Laden” will be on sale in the Shop at a limited-time discount.</p><p>Version 5.3 continues to offer new features for different in-game modes. The popular rhythm game will become a permanent gameplay mode, allowing players to compose and share musical scores to showcase their talents. Additionally, Kazuha and Ganyu’s Echo cosmetics will be added to Envisaged Echoes in the Imaginarium Theater lobby, and can be obtained after completing the corresponding new challenges.</p><p>This version is also committed to further optimizing the character level-up process. The character interface now includes a button leading directly to the Training Guide. Artifacts, Weapons, and Character overviews in the Training Guide have been made clearer and easier to understand. The Artifact Inventory Limit will also be increased to 2,100, affording players more space and flexibility in Artifact management. Additionally, Boss enemies will respawn in just 5 seconds after claiming rewards without the need to teleport away, ensuring a smoother, more efficient process for obtaining character level-up materials.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,519 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

        <p>The full game will feature seven zones and over 20 hours of gameplay.</p><p><strong>New Gameplay Teaser Reveals Two Zones</strong></p><p>The world of <em>ReSetna</em> is full of mysteries, and the latest reveal gives players a glimpse into the creation of the Darkness Zone, the desolate region of Acidia, and even some of the game’s bosses.</p><p>Acidia was once the home of Energetech Solutions, a company focused on renewable energy. Their experiments with Entropium, a powerful but unstable synthetic substance, caused massive damage to the environment.</p><p>These reckless tests tore holes in space and time, creating the Darkness Zone, a strange and chaotic dimension where the rules of reality are distorted.</p><p>Now, Acidia is a toxic and dangerous wasteland, filled with the remnants of advanced technology and the scars of Entropium’s devastating effects. </p><p><strong>Original Soundtrack That Mirrors a Decayed World</strong></p><p>Crafted by composer Nikola Jeremic, the <em>ReSetna</em> soundtrack fuses organic and synthetic sounds to reflect the post-apocalyptic setting. </p><p>Using real instruments like metal and wood, distorted to sound “dirty” and “decayed,” Jeremic’s score blends retro synthwave and ambientwave elements. </p><p>The result is a unique soundscape that breathes life into <em>ReSetna</em>‘s world of forgotten machines.</p><p><strong>All Game Art Elements Born Purely From Imagination</strong></p><p>Every character, enemy and environment in <em>ReSetna</em> has been meticulously crafted by Today’s Games’ art team.</p><p>“Each boss is unique, telling a dark story of the forgotten past. Through our art, we sought to let the visuals speak for themselves, embracing the power of visual storytelling,” the team explained. </p><p><strong>Great News for Players Worldwide</strong></p><p><em>ReSetna</em> features a unique Tetris Chip Upgrade System, allowing players to collect and customize upgrades for abilities and weapons. This flexible system encourages exploration and strategic play to overcome increasingly difficult challenges.</p><p><em>ReSetna</em> will be localized into English, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish (Latin), Portuguese (Latin), German, French, and Russian. This effort ensures that players across the globe can fully immerse themselves in the story and world of <em>ReSetna</em>.</p><p>This <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> is set to launch worldwide on January 31, 2025 on Steam and <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, with releases on other consoles following in Q1 2025.</p><p>For those eager to experience the gameplay, a demo is available now on Steam.
