Combat scenarios are peppered with unique environmental hazards, from ticking time bombs to runaway trains. There is never a dull moment in Showgunners!</li><li><strong>Become a Star of the Show</strong> – Gain fame by avoiding death, surviving rounds, and eliminating your enemies with gruesome panache.

The world reacts gently to Mika’s presence—spirits respond with curiosity, shrines reveal fragments of memory, and small secrets emerge for those who take the time to look.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hand-Painted Watercolor World</strong> – Explore environments created in soft watercolor tones, inspired by Japanese nature and folklore.</li><li><strong>Cozy, Stress-Free Exploration</strong> – No combat, timers, or pressure.
