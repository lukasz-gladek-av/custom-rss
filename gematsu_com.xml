Players can travel to other Waystations, and participate in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [359 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> activities such as harvesting, dancing and mural painting, or simply enjoy the world at their own pace.</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> emphasizes social interaction through a unique friendship progression system which unlocks features over time, such as proximity chat, two-player emotes, instant teleportation, and gift-giving. Beyond construction and socializing, self-expression is encouraged and facilitated with a housing system letting players decorate their own spaces with their own creative vision, and extensive avatar customization options.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During exploration, they will encounter delightfully small square bears, mysterious and charming villagers and wandering spirits in need of help and safety. With patience and kindness they will start to slowly open up to the player, revealing their stories and even gifting items back. </p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PC Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Spirit Crossing - Steam Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKdp5mY8l18?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/spirit-crossing-adds-pc-version]]></content:encoded>
