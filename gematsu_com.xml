    <p><span>Milestone achieved just ahead of cooperative update launch.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Total sales for the Early Access version of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > No Rest for the Wicked [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em> have surpassed one million units, developer <a title="Companies > Moon Studios [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-studios">Moon Studios</a> announced.  The milestone comes just ahead of the game’s <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-together-update-launches-january-22-2026-open-beta-test-now-available">“Together” (cooperative play) update</a> on January 22. <span id="more-1019622"></span></p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> first launched in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,260 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on April 18, 2024, and a full release is planned for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p>“One million copies sold on Steam! You believed in <em>Wicked</em> during Early Access and helped us build it into what it is today!” said Moon Studios in a statement. “That’s not something we take lightly. With <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> ‘Together’ launching next week, this world grows bigger, and more shared, than ever. Thank you for standing with us and for all your support!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and update, via Moon Studios:</p><blockquote><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> “Together” reimagines traditional <a title="Genres > Co-Op [366 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a> play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS, allowing up to four players to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online. Shared upgrades to <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Soulslike combat let enemies react naturally (and desperately) to being cornered or outnumbered, and new hand-picked enemy locations means plenty of new surprises. Players can work together during downtime to share and build housing, visit newly reworked vendors, and employ a simple voting system to keep fellow players from causing too much chaos. In addition to all the cooperative multiplayer features, this latest update brings numerous quality-of-life updates to <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>.</p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is the third full-length game from Moon Studios, following in the footsteps of the immensely beloved Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Players take on the role of a “Cerim,” a member of a holy order imbued with mysterious powers, tasked with destroying the Pestilence, an ancient plague that has begun to consume the island Isola Sacra, itself already the site of great political upheaval and death. Collect and craft weapons, items, engage in tense soulslike combat against fearsome foes, upgrade their character and personal homestead, and play their part in an epic tale of bloodshed and bravery. It’s all brought to life through the signature painterly and vivid art style of Moon Studios that helped define the Ori series as some of the most visually appealing titles of their generation.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
