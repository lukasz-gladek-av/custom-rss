        <p>This is not your parents’ football game or a bloated <a title="Genres > Simulation [834 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> that chases realism at the expense of fun. <em>Mutant Football League 2</em> is a brutal, darkly comedic eight-on-eight arcade-style action-packed football game.
