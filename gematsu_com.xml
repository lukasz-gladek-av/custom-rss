About 15 years ago in the eastern kingdom of Temirana, the third princess was born: a baby with a birthmark on her forehead.</p><p>This child was rumored to be the “Cursed Princess,” and was forced to live in a house far from her family, away from the castle.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But things are about to change.</p><p>As her 16th birthday approaches, she attends the dueling tournament known as Helis Duelm. There, she sees five men glowing with a dazzlingly strong light.</p><p>Indeed, the “Cursed Princess” possessed a special and lucky power. Whenever her life might be in danger, people and places would shine as if to warn her.</p><p>Those acquainted with her power warn that those men may have shone because they were dangerous…but she knows their light is different from any she’s seen before. Trusting her intuition, the princess invites the five men to join her order of knights.</p><p>However, some of them have no experience with the sword, and others lack interest in knighthood at all. Can the princess and her small company of five knights overcome the tragedy on the horizon?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Knights Behind the Shining Armor</strong> – From the minds of director Ayumi Takagi (<em>Hana Yaka Nari</em>, <em>Waga Ichizoku</em>), main scenario writer Uta Amemiya (<em><a title="Games > Charade Maniacs [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/charade-maniacs">Charade Maniacs</a></em>), and character designer Nitaka (<em>Touken Ranbu</em>) comes a tale of luck, tragedy, and love developed by otome mainstay <a title="Companies > ichicolumn [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ichicolumn">ichicolumn</a>!</li><li><strong>The Kingdom of Temirana Awaits</strong> – Enjoy a deep storyline with five possible routes that blends political intrigue with romance and drama.
