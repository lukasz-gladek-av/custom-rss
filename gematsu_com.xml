You are The Cleric, an expert in esoteric events, and a glorified government goon. Inspired by classic CRPG games, Esoteric Ebb features deep and branching dialogs with a staggering amount of choices.</p><p>Create the world’s worst cleric. Take on the city through tense TTRPG dice rolls. Struggle to maintain control with your Stats chiming in at every moment. Let the voices guide you into insane encounters and hit that natural 20 right when you need it. Become the most interesting player at the table and completely ruin your DM’s day.</p><p><strong>Become Lawful Stupid</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Five days until the first-ever election, a tea shop explodes in the heart of the city. They send you to deal with the mess.</p><p>You wake up in a morgue with half the river in your boots, surrounded by ten thousand rotting apples, several corpses, and one zombie. Out of your depth and with no official backup, you delve into your beloved city to investigate the impossible mystery no one wants you to solve. Juggle factions and play them against each other. Explore the streets and tunnels of a fantasy metropolis. Debate devils, drunk sphinxes, and all manner of fantastical fools in a world where mythological creatures sell newspapers at corner shops and ideologies overtake the ramblings of dead gods.</p><p>Don’t forget the most important question: What are you voting in the election?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Make Choices That Will Come Back to Bite You</strong> – Shifting alliances! Risky dungeoneering! Complete open-ended quests, low and high-stakes alike, set in the streets, towers, and dark tunnels of Norvik. Become the city’s savior, its demise, or bumble your way into absolute power.</li><li><strong>Trust the Dice</strong> – Let chance guide you! Roll to wrestle dwarves, steal anything in sight, or to keep yourself from looking like a complete fool. But remember, in true TTRPG fashion, failure can often be way more interesting.</li><li><strong>It’s All in Your Head</strong> – Debate yourself! Each Ability Stat has a conflicting viewpoint and loves to interrupt important conversations. No matter whose side you fall on, you’ll complete quests in wonderfully ridiculous ways.</li><li><strong>Wield Reality-Shaping Magic</strong> – Use The Cleric’s power for unique narrative choices. Control minds for fun and profit. Detect secrets in the tunnels below or in the thoughts of your enemies. Speak with anyone, living or dead, just to see how they insult you.</li><li><strong>Turn-Based Encounters</strong> – Clerics in Norvik are taught to use violence as a last resort. When the need does arise, a roll of the dice determines life or death. But you always have a bizarre solution to any problem, don’t you?</li><li><strong>The <a title="Platforms > Quest [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>ing Tree</strong> – Your quest log, skill tree, and mind map all at once.
