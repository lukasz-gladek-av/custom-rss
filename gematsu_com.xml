    <p><span>Also available through GeForce NOW cloud gaming.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released new information, footage, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil Requiem [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em>, including new gameplay, additional details on the game’s Porsche and Hamilton collaborations, and more. <span id="more-1019594"></span> </p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay and Story</strong></p><p>FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft and Legendary <a title="Platforms > DS [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/ds">DS</a>O agent Leon Kennedy star as the dual protagonists of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, offering players a unique combination of death-defying <a title="Genres > Action [3,325 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and spine-tingling <a title="Genres > Survival [502 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [803 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>. As revealed previously, both protagonists will be playable in first-person perspective for deeper immersion, and third-person perspective for more dynamic action, swappable at any point during the game.</p><ul><li><strong>Leon Kennedy</strong> – Leon, experienced in both hand-to-hand combat and firearms, is investigating a series of suspicious deaths. While navigating this deadly situation, he’s able to wield a variety of weapons and execute close-quarters combat maneuvers with the all-new hatchet. Perfect Leon’s skills as you time your moves to parry enemy attacks, turn the tables as you attack with a chainsaw seized from an enemy, and pull off exhilarating finishing moves to deliver the final blow.</li><li><strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong> – Grace begins her survival journey in a sanatorium overrun with zombies, requiring fierce judgement when deciding which enemies to fight and which to avoid. Limited resources and carrying capacity force the player to make critical decisions that can mean life or death. Acquiring a special device allows Grace to craft vital items using infected blood, unlocking the opportunity to diversify your attack strategies. The Requiem assault revolver, a special nod to the game’s name, is a custom gun boasting immense power and will likely be your last resort for survival. With limited ammo, will you use it right away or save your ammo for the horrors ahead?</li><li><strong>Zombies</strong> – The zombies in this game have lost their minds, however some seem fixated on actions from their lives before death. A chef obsessed with <a title="Genres > Cooking [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, a singer who keeps singing, a janitor who polishes mirrors endlessly…Could you exploit their behaviors to outmaneuver them?</li><li><strong>Elpis</strong> – Elpis is the keyword that connects everything: the death of Grace’s mother, Alyssa Ashcroft; Grace’s own past; and the story connected to Leon. It’s up to you, the player, to unravel the mystery that leads to the truth behind the events depicted in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>.</li><li><strong>Difficulty</strong> – Players can choose from multiple difficulties when experiencing the horror and action. Casual offers aim assist, plus more forgiving player health and enemy durability. Standard (Classic) heightens the tension, requiring Ink Ribbons for each save while playing as Grace, demanding strategy not only in resource <a title="Genres > Management [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> but also when to save.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

    <li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a></li>    </ul>

    
    <p><span>Milestone achieved just ahead of cooperative update launch.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Total sales for the Early Access version of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > No Rest for the Wicked [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em> have surpassed one million units, developer <a title="Companies > Moon Studios [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-studios">Moon Studios</a> announced.  The milestone comes just ahead of the game’s <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-together-update-launches-january-22-2026-open-beta-test-now-available">“Together” (cooperative play) update</a> on January 22. <span id="more-1019622"></span></p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> first launched in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,260 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on April 18, 2024, and a full release is planned for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p>“One million copies sold on Steam! You believed in <em>Wicked</em> during Early Access and helped us build it into what it is today!” said Moon Studios in a statement. “That’s not something we take lightly. With <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> ‘Together’ launching next week, this world grows bigger, and more shared, than ever. Thank you for standing with us and for all your support!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and update, via Moon Studios:</p><blockquote><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> “Together” reimagines traditional <a title="Genres > Co-Op [366 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a> play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS, allowing up to four players to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online. Shared upgrades to <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Soulslike combat let enemies react naturally (and desperately) to being cornered or outnumbered, and new hand-picked enemy locations means plenty of new surprises. Players can work together during downtime to share and build housing, visit newly reworked vendors, and employ a simple voting system to keep fellow players from causing too much chaos. In addition to all the cooperative multiplayer features, this latest update brings numerous quality-of-life updates to <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>.</p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is the third full-length game from Moon Studios, following in the footsteps of the immensely beloved Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Players take on the role of a “Cerim,” a member of a holy order imbued with mysterious powers, tasked with destroying the Pestilence, an ancient plague that has begun to consume the island Isola Sacra, itself already the site of great political upheaval and death. Collect and craft weapons, items, engage in tense soulslike combat against fearsome foes, upgrade their character and personal homestead, and play their part in an epic tale of bloodshed and bravery. It’s all brought to life through the signature painterly and vivid art style of Moon Studios that helped define the Ori series as some of the most visually appealing titles of their generation.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
