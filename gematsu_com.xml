While the game at its core is a turn-based game about logic and chance, I really wanted it to be set in a ‘proper’ fantasy world that has a backstory, an underlying logic, and a consistency. Yes, you’re rolling dice and collecting items, but the visuals are hand-drawn and would also work in a <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [549 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> or roleplaying game.”</p><p>Resolution Gmaes CEO Tommy Palm added, “Innovation is at the core of what we do here at Resolution Games, and we’re very proud of the work we’ve done for immersive games. But there’s plenty of fun to be had outside of headsets too. When Henrik and David put the first prototype of GrimKeep in my hands, I simply couldn’t put it down. Good games should be shared with the world – whether they’re pioneering new ways to play like our recently released Spatial Ops, or they’re putting exciting new twists on familiar formulas such as <a title="Genres > Roguelike [313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> deck builders.”</p><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.
