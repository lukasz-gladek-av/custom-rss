Renowned for its explosive 3D graphics and high intensity gameplay, <em>Under Defeat</em> features no less than three game modes offering high levels of replayability, all of which have been integrated under supervision of G.rev.</p><p>Arcade Mode faithfully replicates the original arcade experience, with a 4:3 ratio and a pseudo vertical screen. New Order Mode adapts the game for modern displays, transforming the adrenaline packed shooting <a title="Genres > Action [2,287 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> to widescreen 16:9 ratio, and New Order Mode+ brings a host of additional elements to the game, not least being a “WARNING GAUGE,” which adds a risk/reward mechanic to assist the player as they shoot, bomb and swerve through the hordes of enemy invaders.</p><p>In addition, <em>Under Defeat</em> comes complete with an incredible soundtrack, newly boosted by video game music veteran, Shinji Hosoe (<em>Ridge Racer</em> series, <em>Tekken</em> series, etc.) and his company, Super Sweep.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
