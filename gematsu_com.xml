    <p><span>A wholesome adventure from ToeJam &amp; Earl Doki-Doki Universe creator Greg Johnson.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > HumaNature Studios" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/humanature-studios">HumaNature Studios</a>, the studio led by <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> and <em>Doki-Doki Universe</em> creator Greg Johnson, has announced <em><a title="Games > Dancing with Ghosts" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dancing-with-ghosts">Dancing with Ghosts</a></em>, a life <a title="Genres > Simulation [824 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> about finding joy from grief. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,593 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanaturestudios/dancing-with-ghosts" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> will launch in October. <span id="more-989314"></span></p><p>The story follows Mai, a 15 year-old Thai girl who feels lost and overcome with guilt after the death of her parents. She meets an 11 year-old ghost, who lost her memory and is trapped in this world.</p><p>The idea came to be after the passing of Johnson’s 28-year-old daughter, and his family’s loss of everything in the 2023 Lahaina fires.</p><p>“I’ve been through some difficult times in my life, but I always remember the people who reached out, and tried to bring some light when things were dark,” said HumaNature Studios founder and <em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> creator Greg Johnson in a press release. “My team and I are making <em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> to bring joy to people who need it, and we hope you support our efforts to bring this to the world.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via HumaNature Studios:</p><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is a wholesome, interactive-narrative with a compelling, heartfelt story full of charm and humor. The interactive narrative is set within the chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village. Players play the role of Mai, a 15 year old Thai girl who feels lost and overcome with guilt because of the death of her parents. Mai meets an 11 year old ghost, who has lost her memory and who is trapped in this world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Mai is the only one who can see the ghost, and there is a reason why their fates are tied together. Mai decides to help the ghost remember who she was and fulfill her dream so she can move on. Ironically, Mai, the living girl, struggles to enjoy life, while the ghost girl is full of vibrancy and life. Mai sets out to help the ghost, but it is really the ghost that teaches Mai how to be fully alive.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_989317"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is at the heart of the story and at the heart of the gameplay. The story bravely dives into questions about life and death, with heart and sensitivity. It explores themes of self-forgiveness, acceptance, empathy for the struggles of others, and even romance… well, in a very innocent and sweet way.</p><p>Players get to play both as Mai and as the ghost. As Mai you help others in the village and earn good Karma to help Pim on her way. You play cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story.</p><p>Players also play as the ghost, entering the minds of everyone in the village and hearing their thoughts. The ghost is able to help these people by bringing them “Heartlights” for positive energy, and is able to hear what their needs are and then communicate this to Mai, who can then help them.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
