Players will experience the opening tutorial and introduction, character and mech customization, an explorable space station, all three core game modes, a training room, and thirteen distinct mechs or “Strikers.” Other new updates in this beta include revised maps for the six-versus-six Operation VERGE and three-versus-three Ace Arena game modes, a player reputation system, balance adjustments to various Strikers, combat finishing moves, and new customization options for pilots and mechs.</p><p>The all new player-versus-player-versus-environment mode “Mashmak”—available to the public for the first time—sees pilots battling over the Mashmak Isles, which hold the largest reserves of Eruptive Inorganic Carbide (EIC), also known as “Corite.” The region recently came under the control of an organization known as Theia’s Vanguard, and their destructive actions are accelerating the spread of Corite, pushing the world to the brink of disaster. Constant battle for control of the islands has created unpredictable Corite pulse storms, which are capable of devouring everything in their path.</p><p>To handle these harsh conditions, new equipment has been developed to give Striker pilots an advantage. Pilots can choose to deploy a selection of new equipment including weapon pickups and weaponized gliders to dynamically enhance their Striker’s capabilities in close-quarters combat, healing, sniping, suppressive fire, and more in order to complete the mission. As the battle rages on, more powerful weapons and equipment will be made available for the truly hardened pilot.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mecha BREAK</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, followed by PlayStation 5 later in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade, and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Home to the world’s greatest minds, GATE operates a global network of secretive research laboratories, spanning every field of scientific study—and the realms beyond.</p><p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable—including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect—known as The Order—is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home—for now.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> brings a 90s science-fiction twist and rich character progression to the <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> open world survival crafting genre. Up to six players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Science Meets Violence</strong> – Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps – everything your big science brain can muster!</li><li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong> – Make yourself at home—you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.</li><li><strong>Form the Ultimate Think Tank</strong> – Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.</li><li><strong>Survive to See Your Next Day Off</strong> – Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional science-fiction <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Abiotic Factor - Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFAE8NENDHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re venturing into uncharted territory: the unsettling abyss of space.”</p><div id="carousel_943726"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Supermassive Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. Twelve light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth.</p><p>In space, death takes many forms.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Alien Invasion</strong> – The colony ship Cassiopeia is infected with an alien organism, capable of transforming into any member of the crew. While you may be human, others in your crew may not be, and killers can hide behind familiar eyes. New <a title="Genres > Stealth [74 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> mechanics have been added to help players evade these deadly foes: you must keep your wits about you as enemies can emerge from unexpected places, and you’ll need to sneak and hide to get past these deadly alien stalkers.</li><li><strong>Brave Recruits</strong> – Introducing the Cassiopeia’s crew. You’ll control five crew members over the course of this expedition, but as paranoia and fear builds, so does distrust. With their lives in your hands, your decisions will determine not only the crew’s fate, but all of humanity’s, too.</li><li><strong>New Mechanics </strong> – <em>Directive 8020</em> introduces several new tools. Throughout the game, you can use these to locate secrets, solve puzzles and overcome enemies. The mission is all about <a title="Genres > Survival [373 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, so every tool has its purpose in helping you think on your feet and stay alive.<ul><li><strong>The Flashlight</strong> – As is to be expected from our games, you’ll spend a lot of time creeping around in the dark! Just be careful when using your flashlight, as aliens can spot the beam.</li><li><strong>The Scanner</strong> – You’ll have a scanner at your disposal for detecting electronics and remotely activating systems, helping to distract enemies and overcome obstacles.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > The Messenger [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-messenger">The Messenger</a></strong> – Your messenger lets you communicate and strategize with crewmates while staying under the radar.</li><li><strong>The Wedge Tool</strong> – Made for opening doors… but as a last resort, can also be used as a weapon to temporarily stun enemies, giving you a chance to slip away and evade death.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><em>The Dark Pictures</em></strong></p><p>Fans of Supermassive Games’ previous releases will be pleased to know that the DNA of <em>The Dark Pictures</em> is still present—in fact, everything you love about <em>The Dark Pictures</em> is still here, from branching plotlines to impossible choices and split-second quick-time events. In addition, gameplay has been redesigned, polished, and amped up to bring more of a threat when exploring the environment.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
