        <p><em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</em> is a story of people who try to accomplish an impossible mission and survive in the sinister Chornobyl Zone.</p><p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are based entirely on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, people have made a real leap in civilization. However, the construction of the utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society. Due to severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious “Planewalker” initiative to provide for his family.</p><p>It quickly becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole’s universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative that involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means possible. In addition, the Planewalker service requires appropriate genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of chernobylite and, to increase his physical and intellectual capabilities, lose a part of his humanity. However, seeing no other options for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him ending up trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone’s dark guide and silent ruler.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World Exploration</strong> – Explore the big and realistic open world of the real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Chernobylite has taken over the zone, transforming many of its elements, and people are trying to defend themselves against it using prototype technology.</li><li><strong>Character Development</strong> – Create and develop your hero. Attributes and skills will affect the effectiveness of combat, as well as the style of conversation. An arrogant muscle man with a big sword trying to intimidate everyone? Or a smart sniper who always finds the right arguments? The choice is yours.</li><li><strong>Diverse Combat</strong> – Fight for survival with an advanced melee combat system, or keep your enemies away with a diverse arsenal of firearms. You can also use the <a title="Genres > Stealth [73 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> approach or ask others for help.</li><li><strong>Team Building</strong> – Embark on the exciting journey of team building. Each of your mates is a potential teacher, ready to impart their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring. The question is, will you earn their trust and unlock their full potential?</li><li><strong>Planewalking</strong> – Adapt your build and equipment to the situation with planewalking, which allows you to change things on the fly. You’re free to develop more than one character skill set. Are you encountering a situation that your previously prepared heavy melee build will solve better than your current ranged sniper? Planewalk and use another one.</li><li><strong>Base Development</strong> – Develop your base. There, you can create valuable items and upgrade your weapons every day. Assign your people to tasks, and they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</li><li><strong>Factions</strong> – Fight for influence and negotiate with factions.
