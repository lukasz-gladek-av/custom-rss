Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> brings new cooperative and competitive gameplay to the Flower Kingdom, in addition to other new content and enhancements specifically for Nintendo Switch 2. Gather friends and family and visit Bellabel Park, a new area of the Flower Kingdom that features two large plazas filled with attractions. Team up or face off in challenges like Fast Cash: Tip Tap’s Coin Spree where you collect as many gold coins as you can, or Knock ‘em Back: Bubble Blaster where you duke it out and try to survive with the most lives intact.</p><p>Local Multiplayer Plaza features 17 different types of attractions which you can play with up to three friends on the same system1. The game supports GameShare functionality, so if one player has the game, they can share it locally with up to three other players. You can also visit Game Room Plaza which supports online and local wireless play. Here, each player brings their own system to play locally or online, joining the action on their own screen. Up to 12 friends can compete against one another in Game Room Plaza’s six additional attractions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1020680"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Other features new to this edition of the game include:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Toad Brigade Training Camp</strong> – In Bellabel Park, you can also put your skills to the test across a wide variety of challenges set in courses from <em><a title="Games > Super Mario Bros. Wonder [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a></em>. As you progress through the main game, you will have access to even more training courses from across the Flower Kingdom. Complete the trainings on your own or try clearing the objectives with up to three other players to rise through the rankings of the Toad Brigade and aim to become an elite explorer.</li><li><strong>Assist Mode</strong> – New to the Super Mario Bros. Wonder experience? There’s plenty of help here. Turn this on while you play the courses and you’ll have the opportunity to recover quickly from unexpected falls into pits without losing a life or avoid taking damage no matter which character you play as. No pressure, all play!</li><li><strong>Familiar Friends</strong> – This new edition brings none other than Rosalina herself to the Flower Kingdom for the first time! And she’s not alone—Co-Star Luma is also along for the ride as an assist character, available when at least two people are playing together. Luma won’t take damage but can help other players out by spinning to defeat enemies and gather coins in the courses. You can even control Luma using the <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> mouse control functionality!</li><li><strong>And Mischievous Enemies</strong> – While Rosalina and Luma are welcome guests, you may feel differently about the Koopalings, who (of course) arrive to add a bit of chaos. After treasure hidden inside Bellabel Park is stolen by the seven Koopalings, they all flee to various worlds across the Flower Kingdom. Keep an eye out because if you stumble upon one, you’ll now have to enter their course and engage in battle with them!</li></ul><p>These new features and more are available when <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> launches on March 26. If you already have the original <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> game and Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll be able to access the new content by purchasing an upgrade pack. Pre-orders for the <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> upgrade pack begin today on My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Launching alongside the <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> game on March 26 are three new amiibo. Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower are all coming to join the fun!</p></blockquote><p>The Talking Flower from the <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,219 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> 2 release will also be available to purchase on March 12.
