        <ul><li><strong>New Operators</strong><ul><li><strong>Tangtang</strong> (6-star Caster) – Described as a “one-girl team,” Tangtang is specialized in AOE Cryo damage and support. Her Ultimate, DA CHIEF SEES YOU!, introduces a powerful new tactical layer by immobilizing all enemies within its range – including bosses – allowing her squads to create decisive damage windows.</li><li><strong>Rossi</strong> (6-star Guard) – The only operator currently capable of converting Arts Infliction on enemies into Vulnerability (defense break). This specialized mechanic positions her as a vital force multiplier for Physical-focused squads, as she shreds enemy defenses to facilitate massive damage output from the team’s primary carries.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hydro-Industrialization</strong><ul><li><strong>New Tech</strong> – The Hydro Mining Rig allows players to mine Cuprium, a new industrial resource that uses water flow instead of electricity. Unlike existing facilities, Hydro Mining Rigs harness water flow to automate mineral collection, requiring no connection to the power grid.</li><li><strong>New Logistics</strong> – New Conduits for long-distance liquid transport and Water Treatment Units for processing sewage.<br>Forges of the Sky Expansion: Placement limit for Forges of the Sky increased to four units, significantly raising the production ceiling for endgame resources.</li></ul></li><li><strong>World and Story Expansions</strong><ul><li><strong>New Wuling Area</strong> – Qingbo Stockade</li><li><strong>Story</strong> – The Endministrator can investigate the Qingbo Stockade, where tensions with Wuling City are boiling over due to the arrival of Nefarith and Ardashir.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Player Rewards and Progression</strong></p><p>In addition to the launch window offering of 135 free pulls, player rewards will now be supplemented by:</p><ul><li><strong>New Beginner Support</strong> – After reaching specific milestones in Chapter 1, players will receive a new beginner mission reward totalling 10 Chartered Headhunting Permits. Endministrators who have already completed these requirements can claim their rewards directly from the event page upon the update.</li><li><strong>Sign-In Events</strong> – “Gently Flows Qingbo” and “Pearl of the Pack” (7-day logins) for limited-time permits.<br>Battle Pass Update: The Protocol Pass now allows for periodic acquisition of Basic Headhunting Permits.</li><li><strong>Limited-time Activities</strong><ul><li><strong>Exploration Day</strong> – Farming at Originium Science Park.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Survival [513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Training</strong> – Try a different take on combat using only Industrial Explosives!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Systemic Rewards</strong> – AIC Quota acquisition has been expanded, with players now receiving Quotas for obtaining 4, 5, and 6-star operators for the first time. For operators acquired prior to the update, the corresponding Quotas will be distributed via in-game mail.</li><li><strong>Advanced Gear Optimization</strong> – The introduction of the Valley Multi-Line Engraving Kit – available through the Stock Redistribution system—allows players to create Essences with three customized stats. This provides a high-level path for Endministrators to optimize endgame weapon builds and reduce RNG friction.</li></ul><p><strong>Community-Driven Optimizations</strong></p><p>Following launch feedback, Version 1.1 introduces sweeping improvements to the user experience, particularly for controller players.</p><ul><li><strong>Construction Precision</strong> – The buffer range for power lines has been extended to 20m (100m total), and connection will no longer snap during dialogue or combat triggers. Controller users can also now move facilities by long-pressing a dedicated button.</li><li><strong>Exploration HUD</strong> – A new feature allows the minimap and game map to be accessed while using ziplines, improving navigation across the vertical terrain of Qingbo Stockade.</li><li><strong>Combat Ready</strong> – Operators now enter Protocol Spaces with maximum HP and Ultimate Energy. Additionally, the Red Flash enemy attack telegraphs have been re-tuned for better visibility during chaotic encounters.</li></ul><p>The expansion of Talos-II will continue at an even larger scale in Version 1.2. The upcoming narrative arc will see the Endministrator join forces with Tianshi Zhuang to defend the Xiranite Dam against a sudden siege by Ardashir. This future update will introduce two new maps, an outpost, and a new fluid-based production system for the AIC Factory.</p></blockquote><p><em>Arknights: Endfield</em> is available now for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10009205" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via the official launcher and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arknights-endfield/id6752642477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gryphline.endfield.gp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of videos below.</p><h2><span>“Old Deep Water Dies, by Rising Tide It is Denied” Version Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFplOgyiiiM</p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『アークナイツ：エンドフィールド』バージョン「潮起ち、故淵離る」PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_EalJhJ1dA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe title="「명일방주: 엔드필드」 「몰아치는 새로운 물결, 과거와의 작별」 버전 PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wtqo4BU8KU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《明日方舟：終末地》「新潮起，故淵離」版本PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7hG998Tu84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Dev Log: Optimization Progress and Version Preview</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Arknights: Endfield Dev Log | Optimization Progress &amp; Version Preview now live." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eKTskrTBZxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="『アークナイツ：エンドフィールド』開発者日誌" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrSybpY58mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="「명일방주: 엔드필드」 개발자 일지 | 최적화 진행 상황 및 버전 미리보기가 공개되었습니다." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_9zCZ6n2eo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="《明日方舟：終末地》開發者日誌 | 優化進展與版本前瞻 現已公開。" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQhpNba8dlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/03/arknights-endfield-version-1-1-update-old-deep-water-dies-by-rising-tide-it-is-denied-launches-march-12]]></content:encoded>
