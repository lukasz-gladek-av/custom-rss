It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,810 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> with <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [228 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a> support, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,676 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,688 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,761 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,630 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,314 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932910/I_Robot/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and Atari VCS this spring. <span id="more-943230"></span></p><p>“Throughout his 45-year career, Jeff Minter has retained the spirit of a true indie developer, pursuing game concepts that catch his interest, working with a purposefully small team, and infusing his creations with his unique personal style,” said Atari vice president of games Ethan Sterns in a press release. “<em>I, Robot</em>—a reimagining of an obscure Atari arcade cabinet featuring a robot who has problems with authority—is quintessential Minter.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Jeff Minter is back with another unique take on a 1980s Atari <a title="Genres > Arcade [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a>: <em>I, Robot</em>. Reimagined in Minter’s signature assault of colors, shapes and sounds, this new take on the eclectic arcade title is built from the ground up with new challenges, new twists, and a whole lot of llamas.</p><p>The premise of <em>I, Robot</em> is simple: You take control of an ox-headed robot on a mission to outwit the all-seeing eye. In each level, you’ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don’t jump while the eye’s watching, or you’ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you’ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter’s kaleidoscopic visualizer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.</p><p>At its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade <a title="Genres > Action [2,473 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each.</li><li>Unique tube-<a title="Genres > Shooter [3,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> bonus stages between each level.</li><li>Llamasoft’s unique brand of mind melting visuals.</li><li>Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score.</li><li>Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p>“As always, having ZUN-san make a cover of one of my songs is a dream come true… What!? I have to make a song, too!?” said Toby Fox in a press release. “This time I took the original Megalovania and did bone-lengthening surgery on it to transform it into a cover of Necrofantasia. People might call it lazy, but it is pretty cool. … You know, just like Sans or Yukari. So you can’t complain. By the way, this has nothing to do with the song… But personally, I was really concerned about Sans, a male character, showing up in the female-dominated world of <em>Touhou</em>. Therefore, I made him wear girl’s clothing. Thanks everyone. (Hey! That didn’t fix anything!)”</p><p><em>Undertale</em> lead artist Temmie Chang added, “The song was really cool and gave me a lot of energy and a feeling of nostalgia to a time that’s passed, but meant much to me. It was fun to draw for this while listening to it on loop. I’m really happy I was able to draw each of these illustrations. If you were to tell a baby Tem that she’d get to draw something for ZUN one day, I think her heart would’ve stopped. Thank you for the opportunity! The Yukari Sans drawing is my favorite drawing I’ve ever drawn.”</p><p>Watch a new set of videos below.</p><h2><span>Extra Song Pack Vol. 6 Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Extra Song Pack vol.6 Trailer [Touhou Danmaku Kagura Phantasia Lost]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3fumIG8oAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Megalovania of the Empty Corse” by ZUN</span></h2><p><iframe title="ZUN - 空しき骸のメガロヴァニア（Megalovania of the Empty Corse）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtTCbUhNv84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Necrolovania” by Toby Fox</span></h2><p><iframe title="Toby Fox - Necrolovania（ネクロロヴァニア）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOHY-txkW3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
