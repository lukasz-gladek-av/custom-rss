It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-988385"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via DreadXP:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Embracing the retro aesthetic of Dread Delusion, with a new flavor of unsettling locales and disturbing creatures, <em>Entropy</em> trades real-time, first-person combat for tactical turn-based battles inspired by classic JRPGs, featuring a party of up to six adventuring mercenaries faced with staving off the demonic invasion of their world.</p><p>In this dying age, only pockets of humanity remain. There was no grand apocalyptic event to speak of; only the cruel march of time and the inexplicable infertility of the world led us here. Accursed creatures stalk the barren lands between settlements, which are themselves terrible places; squalid, medieval, and mostly ruled by tyrants.</p><p>This tale begins in the town of Draenog, your theatre performance interrupted by fighting at the gates. Demons have arrived. As a simple thespian, your wooden prop sword will have to do for now; you must gather the troupe and defend yourselves!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>So begins your quest as you journey across an expansive world map, littered with explorable towns filled with colorful characters. Forge your path on this expedition to hell to stop the demonic onslaught.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988386"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Embark on a quest across the poisoned lands to stop the demonic incursion.</li><li>Control a party of up to six characters.</li><li>Hire Mercenaries to replace your fallen party members.</li><li>Tactical turn-based combat.</li><li>Explore a dying world full of unique characters, creatures, challenges, and treasure.</li><li>Level up your characters, increase your stats, and unlock new perks.</li><li>A beautiful retro 3D aesthetic.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
