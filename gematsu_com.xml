Welcome to the future of The Primate Observation Club. Even in 2099 the rule about messing with your unlucky subjects still remains in this sequel: DO NOT feed the monkeys!</p><p><em>The Primate Observation Club is still active and stronger than ever in the year 2099. The world has become a hilariously absurd, retro-futuristic dystopia where spying is even more amusing! <em>Do Not Feed the Monkeys 2099</em> is a digital voyeur simulator that combines narrative, investigation, surveillance, and resource <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>.</em></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Life is about to get a little meta…</p><p>Do you like power? How about controlling the lives of others?<br>Do you like breaking rules? Does it excite you? Maybe “Rebel” is your middle name?<br>Do you want to be part of an exclusive group? Be someone important?<br>Do you want to make some money and become rich?</p><p>If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you’re in luck! You’ve been invited to join The Primate Observation Club. Live out all your heart’s desires as the newest member and if you are already in the Club, it’s time to move up the ladder.</p><p>Observe the monkeys behind cages from the comfort of your home, stash some cash with your side hustle jobs, and maybe even play the role of a divine being by manipulating the lives of your subjects.

Hack security systems, make threatening phone calls or even put your own flavor on an unusual beverage. But then forget all those things, because that’s against Club rules!</li><li><strong>New Game, New Technology</strong> – For previous Club member alumni, you’ll notice we’ve also added some community-requested features beyond the new game experience.<ul><li><strong>An OmniPal</strong> – Gone are the days of surveillance solitude. OmniPals are artificial intelligence represented by holograms that act as promoters of companies. OmniPals are another window into the outside world and may offer some other mysterious functions.</li><li><strong>End-Game Content</strong> – Once you’ve finished the game, new and exciting features such as a Fast Forwarding ability will be available. Who knows what other rewards await you!</li><li><strong>A Peephole</strong> – Peepholes aren’t standard equipment, but eventually you’ll be able to get one.

Send your clones on procedurally generated missions and build them into cybernetic gods in mere minutes as you cut your way through hundreds of blood-thirsty mutants, drug-addled <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and mechanized soldiers. Gather resources for permanent upgrades, recruit allies, make alliances, research forbidden technologies and do your best to prepare for inevitable catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Morgan Lee—leader of a ragtag band of resistance fighters on a prison planet Sigma. Used to house the most dangerous criminals from all known star systems, Sigma is now locked into an endless quarantine after discovery of the Substance—an ever-adapting mass of rogue nano-bots infected by a malicious alien life form. A generation later, the planet is controlled by several factions fighting for domination.</p><p>In the beginning of the game, Sigma is shaken by an unprecedented event—a catastrophic breach of the Substance inside the planet’s only mega-city, housing not only convicts, but also management of various corporations operating on the planet. Everyone is a prisoner now. As the situation escalates and technical systems that control life on Sigma begin to fail, it’s every faction for themselves.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Structure</strong></p><p>In <em>KIBORG</em> the clock is always ticking. Each mission you undertake costs you a day, regardless of its results, and every week or so, new calamity strikes. You must choose your actions carefully, balancing risks and rewards. With your every decision, with each victory and each loss, the story is moving forward. There is no “game over” screen to see and no previous save to load. You must learn to live with the consequences of your actions.</p><p><strong>Roguelite</strong></p><p>Missions are, for the most part, procedurally generated. You never know what enemies and challenges you’ll face. With dozens of enemy types, hundreds of combat modifiers and a plethora of non-combat encounters, no mission is the same.</p><p><strong>Better Killing Through Tech</strong></p><p>Vasiliy uses a piece of future tech called The Cradle to send his clones on each mission. Even if a clone dies, Vasiliy stays unharmed. Clones are equipped with nano-skeleton, that can absorb tech from the fallen enemies and transform it into a variety of cybernetic implants. There are seven implant slots and eight possible implants for each slot. It results in thousands of possible combinations where no build is the same. And all these combinations are visual—they won’t only change how Vasiliy fights, but also how he looks—something that almost no <a title="Genres > Roguelite [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">rogue-lite</a> has done before. And as if it wasn’t enough, there are also hundreds of augmentations—invisible micro-implants that take no slot—to fine-tune your build!</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>When fists start flying, Vasiliy isn’t limited to cyber-tech only. The hand-to-hand combat is as deep, as it is brutal, with a wide variety of defensive and offensive options. Dodge, block and parry enemy strikes, mix different combos and special attacks, use your environment to devastate your enemies. Swing various melee weapons to gain a bloody edge over your opponents or just shoot them in the face with one of the many powerful firearms. But manage your resources carefully: ammo is scarce, melee weapons can break easily, defensive options drain your stamina while special strikes cost energy that you recharge with basic attacks.</p><p><strong>Take a Moment to Rest</strong></p><p>Your base is your fortress, a haven between missions. Chat with your allies (all with strong, eclectic personalities), listen in to their conversations or to news broadcasts, meditate in the garden, admire your collection of trophies, train in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [206 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>. Or craft power upgrades to help you in combat.</p><p>Because in <em>KIBORG</em>, the clock is always ticking.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kiborg - Nintendo Switch Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbfT2hgBvjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kiborg-coming-to-switch-on-december-9]]></content:encoded>
