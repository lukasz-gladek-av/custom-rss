      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Evan Korzon" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/evan-korzon">Evan Korzon</a> has release first-person puzzle game <em><a title="Games > Chroma Zero [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/chroma-zero">Chroma Zero</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016230" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a> for $9.99, the developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ekorz.bsky.social/post/3m7sakl3jwk2b" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1005316"></span></p><p><em>Chroma Zero</em> first launched for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3121470/Chroma_Zero/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on December 12, 2024.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Evan Korzon:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Explore a unique and connected world. Understand its fragile balance, uncover its deepest questions, and find more than just the answers.</p><p><em>Chroma Zero</em> immerses you in a universe of mystery, color, energy, and movement, and challenges your expectations and intuition. There are no levels, the puzzles are integrated into the fabric of the space itself, and everything can change in the blink of an eye. Exploration and curiosity are rewarded.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Playtesters have taken between six and 12 hours to finish the game, and a bit more to explore everything. Most progress is gated only by knowledge, which is gained by exploring and experimenting.</p><p>This is an immersive, non-linear, risk-taking and moderately challenging game, made by a solo developer. The narrative is mostly light-hearted, but can be impactful at times. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty, though the game helps to guide you as well. So if you’re exploring everywhere, you will know what to do—maybe just not how to do it! I was inspired by games like <em>Antichamber</em>, <em><a title="Games > Outer Wilds [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a></em> / <em><a title="Games > Riven [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/riven">Riven</a></em>, and the discovery elements of <em>Tunic</em>. I hope to bring more games like these into the world, since by their nature they are focused on giving you a wonderful and surprising first-playthrough.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge Based Progression</strong> – Learn the rules of the space, and you can progress farther in the world and deeper into the mystery</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Open-World [791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> Puzzles</strong> – Explore everywhere, the world itself is the puzzle.
