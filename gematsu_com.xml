Through various ingredients and experiences, you’ll strengthen your dragon daughter’s stats with your unique strategy. The joy of trial and error as you aim for the strongest dragon is unparalleled. There’s even a “debt” system, so you might find yourself raising her while desperately managing money!</li><li><strong>Multiple Endings Through Free-Form Gameplay</strong> – This free-form game allows you to raise completely different dragon daughters based on your choices. Depending on your nurturing approach, various endings will appear. For those who want to delve deeper, why not play again and again to discover all the endings? The dragon daughter’s growth is depicted through cute pixel art and abundant animations. However, if you persevere, you might uncover a serious story that you couldn’t imagine from the pop and humorous world view.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;DRAPLINE&quot; Early Access Announcement for Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQT8AGjMujg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam版『DRAPLINE』2025年6月30日 アーリーアクセス開始_PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYkLUe7_VrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
