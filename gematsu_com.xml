It will launch in June. <span id="more-967326"></span></p><p><em>VOIN</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464530/VOIN/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Nikita Sozidar’s latest developer log:</p><h2><span>“Permafrost” Developer Log</span></h2><p><iframe title="VOIN - &quot;Permafrost&quot; Update Developer Log" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VTQo0c1y5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone, I’m Nikita, and for the past year-and-a-half, I’ve been <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>. Take a look.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>VOIN</em> is a first-person <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a> with <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> elements set in <a title="Genres > Open-World [635 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>-like levels. The game is about you being an unstoppable force of nature that wields metal as it weapon. The world is broken and you are its reckoning.</p><p><strong>Items and Affixes</strong></p><p>You kill monsters, you get loot, which is the game’s bread and butter. And instead of affixes that plainly increase random stats, I decided to focus only on impactful stuff that actually changes the way you play. For example, you might find a hammer called Bell Ringer, which summons ghostly bells that—when hit—damages everyone around.</p><p>Or another example, which I also like a lot—a really powerful scythe that literally tears reality as you swing leaving scars that emanate freezing aura—or should I say a cool aura. No I shouldn’t say that. But guess what? You can also combine those two items into one. Find the symbiosis station at the hub, read the instructions carefully—please—and boom you have dual wakizashis that poison everyone and summon fire tornadoes—that’s a thing. But enough of that let’s get to the next exciting thing.</p><p><strong>The World</strong></p><p>In the last major update, Thunderborn, I added a huge dungeon underneath the Cathedral of Veiled Lament. Now, though, I’m working on the game’s next major update called Permafrost. It features a new absolutely massive new location the Athenium of Thousand Names. Snow-covered mountains, ice giants, perpetual blizzards—this place does not offer a warm welcome, not at all.</p><p>One of the other major features of this update is proper character progression—finally! Journey to the Hall of Reflection and find the new tree of talents (yes, your talent tree is an actual tree). And not only that, while exploring you’ll be finding Soul Fruits, which you can attach to the tree and gain various bonuses—for example, the ability to sprint. And you can already play the talent tree update—right now.</p><p>Anyway the game is shaping up great and there are a lot more super exciting things coming. For example, a completely new character, completely new weapon types—spears daggers and more—and even quests.</p><p>All right guys, that’s it for me. Thank you very much and see you next time.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Explore the lands of a once-prosperous island, hone your combat skills, and survive in the unforgiving realm of the Kingdom of the Seven.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rewarding World Exploration</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>‘s world is full of hidden treasures, underwater caves, side quests and bosses, and valuable loot. Some of these can be found with a treasure map, while others with pure luck. The game has no marker system, and quests won’t lead you by the hand. Rediscover the joy of exploration and let curiosity be your guide; the world promises rich rewards for those who dare to uncover its secrets.</li><li><strong>Deep Character Progression and World Evolution</strong> – Build your characters as you like with three different skill branches: <a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, Craftsmanship and War. Allocate your character’s attribute points and unlock passive bonuses by exploring the world. The social system makes your progression even more noticeable: As the hero’s skills grow, the world around him reacts differently. If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin, by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet.</li><li><strong>Rich Storytelling</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is set in the low-fantasy cruel medieval world. Make your path from abandoned lowlife to a marshal of fortunes, choose your side and forge alliances on your journey to discover the truth of who you really are.</li><li><strong>Methodical <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a> Combat</strong> – The combat system in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> allows players to use three different combat stances with unique combat styles for different weapons. You are not a Legendary powerful Hero by default in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>. You need to learn the ropes of becoming one! Learn to stand up for yourself by timing your attacks, using environments, and active skills. Invest in the War branch to become more skilled not just in numbers: attacks become more accurate and stronger, and you’ll learn more tricks. For example, you’ll be able to throw bottles from the ground to stun your opponents!</li><li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere</strong> – Players are encouraged to slow down and fully embrace the world around them. The richly detailed environment comes alive with a dynamic day-night cycle, shifting weather, and natural elements like wind that sways the trees. Ambient sounds—from the soft rustle of leaves to distant birdsong—enhance the immersion, while NPCs follow their own daily routines, adding to the sense of a living, breathing world. The result is an experience that wraps players in a comforting, tranquil atmosphere, inviting them to linger and explore at their own pace.</li><li><strong>When Classic Meets Modern</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is a game for everyone from hardcore RPG fans to casual players. It is inspired by classic old-school RPGs and combines the convenience of modern gaming while paying homage to the legendary classic <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing games</a>. There are no quest markers or enemy auto-levelling, but there’s modern user interface, environment markers, tutorials, and much more.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>World Overview Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - World Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qICLoFcoSdo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
