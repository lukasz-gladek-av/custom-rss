Inspired by Lovecraft’s novella <em>The Mound</em>, this game puts players in the shoes of a squad of conquistadors on an expedition to discover a legendary underground city rumored to hold priceless treasures.</p><p>Deep within an eerie and oppressive jungle, players must explore and survive monstrous, otherworldly entities that distort their senses and threaten their sanity… and their lives. Was that sound just an hallucination? Am I losing my mind and attacking my ally, or is there truly a hostile creature lurking in the shadows? As players venture deeper into the jungle, only teamwork will ensure they make it back alive.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
