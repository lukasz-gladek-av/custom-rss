Meanwhile, The Hospital delivers a claustrophobic descent into madness, where sterile corridors twist into nightmarish labyrinths, echoing with the remnants of a forgotten past.</p><p><strong>Don’t Let Them Merge</strong></p><p>In this latest reveal, players can get a closer look at the much-anticipated “Merge” mechanic in <a title="Genres > Action [2,883 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>. In <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, fallen enemies, known as The Orphans, don’t stay dead for long! If players fail to burn their bodies, these fallen monsters can be absorbed by nearby Orphans. Through a grotesque process known as Merging, enemies transform into faster, stronger, and more horrifying abominations, gaining new abilities and becoming even more formidable in combat, creating terrifying new nightmares for The Traveler to overcome.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>A Traveler Through Time</strong></p><p>Players follow The Traveler in action, an agent of the mysterious Collective who emerges from a dystopian future to journey back through time. Their mission: to extract individuals before they perish in the apocalypse.</p><p>Guided by the cryptic travel log of a mysterious predecessor, Traveler ND 3500, players will explore unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by real-world locations, including the Krakow district of Nowa Huta. Here, decaying Brutalist architecture is warped by reality-bending anomalies.</p><p>The video also gives players a closer look at the game’s unique approach to time travel, as The Traveler navigates two time periods—the decaying future and 1980s Poland—thrusting players into the decaying district of New Dawn, inspired by real-life Nowa Huta, where survival means bending time itself.</p><p>While exploring a world on the edge of annihilation, players will encounter the grotesque and nightmarish enemies known as The Orphans… twisted remnants of a world undone.</p><p><strong>Face the Terror</strong></p><p>In addition, the extended gameplay video offers players a chilling glimpse of one of the game’s formidable bosses, the ominous entity known only as Terror. This encounter sets the tone for the psychological and physical horrors that await.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,940 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> this fall.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase</span></h2><p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW4EcsG_Deg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/cronos-the-new-dawn-sector-a-0-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
