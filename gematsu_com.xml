      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Atari [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a> game publishing and distribution subsidiary Infogrames has acquired publishing rights to <em><a title="Games > Bread &amp; Fred [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bread-fred">Bread &amp; Fred</a></em> from <a title="Companies > Apogee Entertainment [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/apogee-entertainment">Apogee Entertainment</a>, and plans to release “<a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [25,066 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>” versions in the “coming months,” the company announced.</p><p><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> first launched for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,625 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607680/Bread__Fred/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on May 23, 2023, followed by <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,269 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on May 23, 2024.</p><p>Alongside PlayStation and Xbox versions, Infogrames will work with developer Sand Castles Studio to bring even more content and updates to the game.</p><p>“<em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> rose from the indie ranks, representing a level of success that is possible with a small, talented team with a passionate vision,” said Apogee Entertainment CEO Scott Miller in a press release. “We see this property as having many years of success ahead of it, expanding its appeal with new characters, gameplay modes, and its unique style of rage humor that has led to 10s of millions of views on TikTok and other platforms.”</p><p>Infogrames manager Geoffroy Chateauvieux added, “<em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is a rare gem that casual gamers can sit down and enjoy with their hardcore platforming friends. This is a great opportunity for Infogrames to publish a successful game and help continue to grow its loyal fan base by expanding distribution. We are looking forward to continuing to work with Sand Castles Studio to support <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em>‘s long term development plans.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Infogrames:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is a casual but challenging cooperative platformer where players must work together to help two cute and funny penguins, Bread and Fred, jump and climb to the top of a snowy mountain. The title has gained a loyal following as much for its ability to reduce friends to a fit of giggles or tears as for its unique gameplay mechanics, adorable characters and friendly NPCs.</p><p>Players steer the penguin pals through an exasperating and sometimes maddening climb that requires precision with every jump. Tethered together, the characters can use their momentum to swing each other onto higher and higher ledges. But forget to anchor and if one falls they will pull the other down with them.</p><p>Solo players make their way up the mountain as Greg, who must use a rock on a rope (named Jeff), instead of a penguin pal, to swing his way uphill.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
