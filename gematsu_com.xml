As players encounter Aniimo throughout the world, they will discover that Aniimo behave differently when faced with new environments and weather; can be peaceful, provocative, or protective; live in groups or roam by themselves; and other distinguishing factors and behaviors.</p><p>A number of Aniimo took the stage in today’s fresh look at the game to give players an idea of the type of interactions these colorful creatures may have with their environment, as well as with other Aniimo:</p><ul><li><strong>Stellarys</strong> – An evolution of Celestis that can only occur on rainy days, Stellarys uses water to defend and attack and travels alone across Idyll, in stark contrast to Celestis. Because a Celestis that is already owned by a Pathfinder will no longer evolve into Stellarys when in rainy weather, players who want to add a Stellarys to their roster must find and capture one in the wild.</li><li><strong>Helgon and Helmut</strong> – Helgons can exploit Helmuts’ weaknesses in the wild, provoking them to evolve in one of two ways. Most often, Helmut will evolve into Rookguard, which gives them the ability to transform into a metal sphere, thus protecting themselves from Helgon. However, in some rare cases, the bravest Helmuts may instead evolve into Pawney, allowing them to challenge Infregon, the Helgon’s family boss.</li></ul><p>These interactions and evolutions offer just a sneak peek at the variety on display among the Aniimo, with plenty more for Pathfinders to discover when they explore Idyll for themselves. Players eager to get their hands on <em>Aniimo</em> to do so can pre-register at the <a href="https://aniimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for all the latest updates and a chance to be included in upcoming beta tests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Aniimo</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,981 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/aniimo/9pk8phlcqdf6" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, iOS, and Android in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->
