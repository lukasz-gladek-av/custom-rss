            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>San Mateo-based developer Manticoer Games has announced <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [555 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelike [344 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> <a title="Genres > Action [2,883 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em><a title="Games > Out of Time" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/out-of-time">Out of Time</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/out-of-time-5a05f0" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>). It will launch this fall for $24.99. Pre-orders are available now and include the “The Temporal Disaster Pack,” which features three time-twisted mounts, three hero emotes, and four avatars from alternate timelines. <span id="more-979617"></span></p><p>“With <em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favorite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids,” said <a title="Companies > Manticore Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/manticore-games">Manticore Games</a> chief creative officer Jordan Maynard in a press release. “The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!”</p><p>Manticore Games CEO Frederic Descamps added, “Manticore’s mission is to create complex immersive multiplayer experiences. We’ve built <em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core [user-generated content] platform and Unreal. We’re already planning more eras and [player-versus-player] modes, plus additional platforms.”</p><div id="carousel_979618"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Manticore Games:</p><blockquote><p>Welcome to <em>Out of Time</em>, an action roguelike where past, present, and future have shattered, leaving the world in a tangled, yet beautifully chaotic, mess. The good news: You and your friends will have an endless supply of gear and weapon combinations to choose from to build your own unique group of survivors. The bad news: All of mankind is trapped and needing to be saved from a gauntlet of dragons, mutant crabs, evil humanoids, warped beasts, killer robots, and everything in between—often all at once. Not to mention the biggest threat of them all—time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Out of Time</em>, the catalyst to the chaos came from an event known as The Shattering, fusing the past, present, and future together into an unpredictable, ever-changing dynamic battleground. Survivors from all eras gather in Infinitopia, the last bastion of civilization, venturing into dangerous, corrupted regions in fast-paced solo or cooperative missions in a fight to reclaim reality.</p><p>Before you give up, don’t fear! The Shattering can taketh, but also giveth! Armed with gear and weaponry from the medieval times to futuristic cyberpunk utopias to prehistoric antediluvian times to post-apocalyptic wastelands and beyond, players will have over 190 million gear combinations to choose from, allowing them to truly create their own custom loadouts for each run. Classes? Where we’re going we don’t need classes. Every player chooses the gear set that best suits the play style they want to embark on every run. If you want to stack a rocket launcher on top of healing powers and tank armor—you do you.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
