        <p>I will ask you questions, and the conversation will progress based on your answers.</p><p>“What would you do if you could meet your past self?”</p><p>“If you could buy other people’s experiences with money, would you?”</p><p>Some of the questions will be things that you may have asked yourself already. Some may lead you to unexplored parts of your mind.</p><p>There is no right answer. What matters is what you believe.</p><p>After answering a question, you will be shown everyone else’s answers.</p><p>How many chose as you did? And why did the others choose differently?</p><p>Dive into your own mind as you try to glance at someone else’s.</p><p><strong>Lights and Doors for Choices, Within the Warm Embrace of Loneliness</strong></p><p>Every door is connected to an answer.

Some will be about common food items, while some will be about matters of life and death. None of them, however, have clear-cut answers.</p><p>You might wonder: why am I being asked these things in the first place?</p><p>If you realize the reason between all of those questions, you may choose to face the reality hidden behind that simple donut hole.</p><p>But do so at your own discretion. If you go too deep, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to come back up.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><p>There are just two characters: You and I.</p><ul><li><strong>I</strong> – A creature that loves talking, but remains vanishing and mysterious. “I would like to ask you some questions.”</li><li><strong>You</strong> – The choices you will take belong to you, as they come from your own memories and experiences.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><p>A new and improved “rebake” of a game created for a 1-week game jam.

What if we could dream it together?</p><p><em>Reverie in the Moonlight</em> is an action game where, with the help of your stuffed animals, you try to defend yourself from the monsters attacking you night after night.</p><p><strong>Nightly Visits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Little Tete’s nights are restless. His dreams are full of horrible monsters attacking him. But then, one night, he meets <a title="Platforms > Luna [61 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a>, and she teaches him how to use his plushies to defend himself.</p><p><strong>Cute But Strong</strong></p><p>When faced with a monster, Tete can only do one thing: run away. His plushies, however, can actually fight and defeat monsters. Different animals play different roles, with some focusing on short-range attacks, some on long-range shots, and some on supporting their allies. There are 40 types to choose from, so find your favorites and help them protect Tete from the monsters.</p><ul><li><strong>Ham Jr.</strong> – Runs left and right, hitting monsters that get too close with a stick.</li><li><strong>Snoozy-G</strong> – Enjoys sleeping, napping, and resting. Monsters that hit it are slowed down for a while.</li><li><strong>Striped Angel</strong> – When it sees someone in trouble, it always wants to help. It heals Tete up from a distance.</li></ul><p><strong>Collect and Strategize</strong></p><p>After the monsters’ attack is over, you can shop with the gold you found. You can get new plushies and even buy special items that can make you stronger. Some of them will also give you new weaknesses, so it’s up to you to strategize and prepare for the next attack in the best way possible. There are more than 100 items in the game… Will you be able to collect them all?</p><p><strong>Change Clothes to Change Strategies</strong></p><p>So, you’ve played the game’s story to the end. Well done. But this is just the start!</p><p>You can change Tete’s clothes, choosing from more than 20 costumes. Each one makes him stronger in some ways and weaker in others. If you want to help Tete defeat his nightmares, you’ll have to find the right plushies and items to go with each costume!</p><ul><li><strong>Moonlight Wizard</strong> – Plushies with long-range attacks become stronger, but Tete can only use those. Defending yourself becomes harder, so you’ll have to defeat monsters before they can get close.</li><li><strong>Nap Cloud</strong> – Increasing attack power becomes difficult, but plushies that don’t move around attack twice as fast. Try to find as many stationary friends as you can.</li><li><strong>Doggy Friend</strong> – Tete can only use dog plushies. If you want to win, you’ll need to make good use of their fast respawn speed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Official Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Reverie in the Moonlight - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIxwEK7qZPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="トロイメライの月あかり 公式トレイラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5xtptt7exo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="月下夢景（トロイメライの月あかり）官方預告片" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFyKPrlpL-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="月下梦景（トロイメライの月あかり）官方预告片" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJiVRSrpGDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
