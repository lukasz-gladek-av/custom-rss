He visits Mie Prefecture to participate in the “Miketsukuni Eikou Competition” (shortened to “MieCom”), a media competition for articles about Mie Prefecture.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Over the course of a month, participants will travel to various places around Mie Prefecture, gathering materials on location, and writing articles about their charms to submit to MieCom.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ The Three Heroines You Will Meet on Your Journey</strong></p><p><em>Fuuraiki 5</em> depicts the story of three heroines traveling through Mie Prefecture, just like the protagonist. Through repeated interaction, the story may develop in a way that you form a relationship with these women. The protagonist’s encounters with these women will surely brighten up his journey through Mie Prefecture.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong><a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>ne Shikama</strong> (voiced by Yuri Fujimoto)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_009.png"></a></figure><p>A writer for another magazine and MieCom participant who met the protagonist at the competition’s orientation. She is an earnest and kind woman who greets and encourages the nervous protagonist.</p><p>For the competition, she has decided to write an article about history (specifically the Sengoku period warlord Kuki Yoshitaka), and is going around locations connected to Kuki Yoshitaka to gather information.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Yuzuki Sonohara</strong> (voiced by Chisato Mori)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_014.png"></a></figure><p>A cheerful and outgoing woman. While she can easily jump to conclusions and intimidates the protagonist when they first meet, after assuming he is a flirt, her natural charm and friendliness make her strangely difficult to dislike.</p><p>Her hobby is photography, and she mainly goes around looking for breathtaking views and hidden gems to capture Mie Prefecture’s beautiful scenery.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Aika Tabuchi</strong> (voiced by Ayaka Fujimoto)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_019.png"></a></figure><p>A woman with a calm vibe. Her father is the president of a major conglomerate, and she is a genuinely pampered woman who always has a bodyguard with her.

If you make a promise, be sure to go to the specified location to meet them.</p><p>Your Mie Prefecture love story will unfold through repeated encounters with these heroines.</p><p><em>—A flag icon indicates locations where an event will occur.

    <p><span>Ishii aiming to create a title that surpasses 428: Shibuya Scramble.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Game designer and <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> executive producer Jiro Ishii has announced the launch of a new “Shibuya Live-<a title="Genres > Action [2,702 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Adventure Game.” Led by general director Ishii and screenwriter Yukinori Kitajima, the project will be a live-action <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> set in Shibuya. Platforms and a release date were not announced, but a crowdfunding campaign will launch via <a href="https://ubgoe.com/projects/923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubgoe</a> on May 28. <span id="more-961606"></span></p><p>Cast members of the project include <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>akazu Arai, who played Keima Amemiya in <em>Machi: Unmei no Kousaten</em>, and Fumio Kitagami, who played Minoru Minorikawa in <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em>.</p><p>The game itself will use an “ensemble drama” system—a synchronized story with multiple protagonists, in which players experience a multiple-perspective structure that shifts between each character’s viewpoint.</p><p>In a message, Ishii said that <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> was created as a successor to the live-action adventure game <em>Machi: Unmei no Kousaten</em>, with the goal of surpassing it. He expected that a game would eventually come along to surpass <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> as well. But over 20 years later, no such title has emerged. At one point, Ishii approached various game companies about a follow-up project, but those discussions fell apart, as many were more concerned with marketing and business than the core of the project. For a time, he even distanced himself from such projects. Ultimately, Ishii and his team decided to develop the new title independently.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
