      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Mortal Kombat 1 [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em> downloadable content character Conan the Barbarian will launch on January 21 for Kombat Pack 2 / “Khaos Reigns” expansion owners and January 28 for all users, publisher <a title="Companies > Warner Bros. Games [640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > NetherRealm Studios [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games/netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</a> announced. <span id="more-938718"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the character, via Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote><p>Downloadable content guest fighter Conan the Barbarian is the towering Cimmerian warrior from the <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (1982) film, featuring the likeness of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of the title character.</p><p>Born on a battlefield, Conan has become one of the most formidable warriors the world has ever seen through relentless toil and kombat. Sold into slavery after his parents are slain and village destroyed by the malevolent warlord Thulsa Doom, he is eventually freed by his master and embarks on a quest for vengeance, his journey culminating in the defeat of Doom, liberating thousands from his sorcerous grip. In <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, Conan stands ready to defend Earthrealm against the vile beings that mean to conquer it.</p><p>Conan’s distinct yet devastating moveset is on full display in the new trailer and is built around his iconic Atlantean Sword. The master blade-wielder can perform complex maneuvers with the imposing steel weapon, including his intricate sword spinning and signature overhead chop to take down opponents with brute force. The video also reveals one of Conan’s gruesome Fatalities and teases the fighter’s Animality, the brutal finishing move that morphs the character into a powerful bull to annihilate defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities are available now as a free content update for all <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> owners.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,662 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,572 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,520 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,132 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
