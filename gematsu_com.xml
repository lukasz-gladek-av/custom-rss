Conquer unholy hordes and slay grotesque bosses. Forge and master your weapons. Wield cursed magic. Discover ancient relics. Evolve. Every step of this bloody descent into the abyss is yours.</p><p>When the hordes of Hell grow stronger and the <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Balance is at risk, Heaven must strike back. As their last line of defense, they unleash the Hellreaper. By sacrificing one of the High Angels, they create a devastating, uncontrollable force that might restore order.</p><p>With the aid of a mysterious entity known as The Three Sisters, you will uncover the secrets of Hell’s corruption—and more. There will also be cats. Probably… with cats, you can never be sure.</p><p><em>HELLREAPER</em> is a tough but fair game with highly responsive controls. We at Awesome Games Studio are a small indie team, but also passionate players. In our previous titles, such as Fury Unleashed and Yet Another Zombie Survivors, we worked closely with our community to deliver the most enjoyable experiences possible. We strive to make our games as awesome as they can be.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
