Pick from a variety of gnomes to deploy, each with their own specialty. Place them at the start of your turn and send them to work gathering resources and supplies while fighting off foes. At the end of your turn, reposition your entire team, add more gnomes if needed, and gather again! But be warned with each turn, the cave becomes more and more unstable and ravenous bats pick at your supplies. So decide when it’s time move on and choose your path down the caves. The deeper you go, the more supplies you’ll need.</li><li><strong>A Different Team For Every Expedition</strong> – Every run lets you adapt, change, and upgrade your team at various points, making each expedition into the caves unique. Modify your team and playstyle to what you need out of the run, mixing it up when a change in tactics is required. Pick and swap from a variety of gnomes to get the job done, assign game-changing upgrades that combine in unexpected ways, and discover hidden special abilities for certain gnomes.</li><li><strong>Progress In Every Run</strong> – Venture into the caves knowing each run gets you resources no matter how they end.
