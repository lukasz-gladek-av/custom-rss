An Xbox One version is seemingly no longer planned. <span id="more-987805"></span></p><p>The new release window was revealed as part of a new development update, where Sad Cat Studios talks through the game’s progress and shares behind the scenes footage showcasing the game’s evolution over the years.</p><p>“We know that our community is incredibly excited to play <em>REPLACED</em> and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all—we apologize for that,” said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release. “We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and <em>REPLACED</em> will be coming to PC and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,800 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a> in spring 2026.”</p><div id="carousel_987808"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Thunderful Games:</p><blockquote><p><em>REPLACED</em> is set in an alternate 1980s America, featuring free-flow action combat and a deep, dystopian story. You play as R.E.A.C.H. – an artificial intelligence trapped in a human body against its own will, striving to adjust to human life, in and around Phoenix-City. Outlaws are rife in a society that has sustained lasting damage and taken a turn for the worse, following a catastrophic nuclear event. Everything is ruled by corruption and greed and the ones in power see humans and their organs as nothing more than currency. <em>REPLACED</em> focuses on a single-player experience, with a mix of cinematic platforming, pixel art and free-flow action combat.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>Fifteen years after reintroducing fans on consoles to Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragically cursed school haunted by the pain of the past, the <em>Corpse Party</em> series returns with a brand-new collection of the iconic saga that made its bloody mark on fans around the world. Available exclusively on <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,578 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, the <em>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</em> bundles four nightmarish narratives united by this keystone of creepiness. Go back to where this haunting adventure began in the modernized original <em>Corpse Party</em> (2021) and its twisted sequel <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, then experience the devilishly fun <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em>, never-before-released on consoles in the west. If you manage to survive all that, the stunning conclusion of the “Heavenly Host” arc awaits in <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em>!</p><p>Whether you’re new to the <em>Corpse Party</em> franchise, or a seasoned veteran of Sachiko’s blood-curdling frights, this collection is a celebration of what makes this series so memorable and shouldn’t be missed.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four Terrifying Tales, One Complete Package</strong> – Play through the entirety of the “Heavenly Host” saga and experience four terrifying tales of intertwined fates in one convenient package.</li><li><strong>Extreme Japanese <a title="Genres > Horror [695 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a></strong> – Explore the halls of Heavenly Host Elementary in a riveting mystery full of vengeful spirits, psychological horrors, and shocking secrets.

As the vengeful spirits of elementary school students threaten their lives and their sanity, their only hope of <a title="Genres > Survival [451 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>–much less escape–is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em></strong> – An anthology series that serves as a <em>Corpse Party</em> sequel, prequel, midquel, and alternate universe tale all in one. <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em> builds upon the events of the first game, exploring or re-exploring past incidents, characters, and points of view, and allowing the player to escape many of the deaths that occurred previously, thus steering them toward all-new (albeit not necessarily better) outcomes.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em></strong> – A (surprisingly) canonical “midquel” to <em>Corpse Party</em> and <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, taking place sometime during the course of those games, <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em> recounts the bizarre events of vengeful ghost girl Sachiko Shinozaki’s one-of-a-kind birthday party held in the otherworldly school where so many lives have been lost in previous games: Heavenly Host Elementary. Surviving to the end will require thinking like Sachiko and making the choices that will please her the most…but with the fewest casualties.</li><li><strong><em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em></strong> – Set two months after <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em> is the definitive conclusion to the long-running Heavenly Host story arc.
