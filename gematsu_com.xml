A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/addyvalentine/gun-nose" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> seeking $35,000 in funding was launched alongside the game’s announcement, which includes $200,000 and $400,000 stretch goals for <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,712 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> and <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,337 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> ports, respectively. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1026926"></span></p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>GUN NOSE</em> is a top-down action mystery game set in the handcrafted, pixel art city of Ironwood. Play as the titular hero, Gun Nose, a robot detective with a mysterious past and a face that can kill. You’re on a mission to track down your missing creator by investigating a string of violent murders. The culprits? A group of Serial Murder-Bots disguised among the population.</p><p>Each case in the main story takes you deeper into the overgrown layers of the city. Cases are semi-procedural, featuring different victims, suspects, clues, and murderers each playthrough. To crack the case, you’ll need to interrogate suspects, analyze evidence, and identify the killer’s unique signature. But this isn’t some cozy walking sim, it’s dangerous! And your suspects won’t go down without a fight.</p><p>Combat is real-time and chaotic. As you close in on the truth, suspects may lash out with Psychic Hacks that summon ghost-like electrical projections designed to tear you apart.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Luckily, you’re not alone. With your quirky AI companion, the Jiminy Drive, and a cast of unlikely allies, you’ll set traps, unlock secrets, and confront a growing conspiracy that lies at the heart of the city.</p><p><strong>Setting</strong></p><p>Don’t let the retro aesthetic fool you, under the hood <em>GUN NOSE</em> is powered by modern design and tech.</p><p>As you explore the city of Ironwood, its residents go about their daily lives: shopping, eating, working, sleeping, and remembering what you do. Some may ask you to track down a lost dog. Others might challenge you to a race across town or beg you to deal with the dinosaurs eating trash behind their apartment.</p><p>But these aren’t filler NPCs. Every character in <em>GUN NOSE</em> is handcrafted with a unique design, personality, backstory, and schedule. You’ll get to know their habits, routines, and relationships.</p><p>Just don’t get too close.</p><p>Because in Ironwood, anyone can be a victim. Anyone can be the killer. And once they’re gone… they’re gone for good.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><p>Within the chaos of this procedural city is a core cast of lively characters you’ll come to rely on to help you solve cases.

    <p><span>Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Following <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/bloober-team-launches-remosd-neul-serorehso-ovam-ceyerd-countdown-website">a countdown</a> that began on New Year’s Eve 2025, <a title="Companies > Bloober Team [118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear 3" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-3">Layers of Fear 3</a></em> for unspecified platforms. A release date was not announced. The reveal comes 10 years after the release of the original <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear (2023) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-2023">Layers of Fear</a></em> in 2016. <span id="more-1026895"></span></p><p>“Good evening and welcome to the <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary showcase,” Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said during today’s <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event. “Some of you have been with us for a very long time. Others arrived later by accident, curiosity, or through a friend’s recommendation. But if you are here, it’s because at some point the story grabbed you and wouldn’t let go. For Bloober Team, <em>Layers of Fear</em> isn’t just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be—what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that <em>Layers of Fear</em> is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.”</p><p>Bloober Team creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart added, “<em>Layers of Fear</em> was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing <a title="Genres > Horror [820 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> into a deeply human experience. When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. <em>Layers of Fear</em> is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself.”</p><p>Babieno added, “There is a certain kind of horror that doesn’t come from what you see. It comes from what you feel and what you can’t stop feeling. For us, that’s always been the core of <em>Layers of Fear</em>. And nothing captures it better than the game’s haunting soundtrack. Its delicate melodies reveal the emotional heart of Layers of Fear, one colored by regret, love, and memory. We are excited to finally be able to share it with you.”</p><p>Bloober Team also announced plans to release a physical edition of the <em>Layers of Fear</em> soundtrack, as well as <em>Layers of Fear</em>-inspired books written by Polish authors and distributed by Foksal. The first book will be written by Marta Bijan and launch in late 2026.</p><p>Watch the <em>Layers of Fear 3</em> teaser trailer and <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event below.
