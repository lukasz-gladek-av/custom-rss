Over time, the house’s simmering hatred for humanity has manifested as a living, pulsating stone heart at its core. Fueled by this dark power, the house now lures unsuspecting humans into its twisted halls, feeding on their fear—and their very bodies—to satiate its hunger and grow ever more powerful.</p><p>In <em>Deck of Haunts</em>, players strategically construct their haunted house by day, setting deadly traps to protect their Heart room, the core of their supernatural power. By night, they must use a deck of terrifying cards to unleash spirits and <a title="Genres > Horror [594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s that gradually drive unassuming explorers insane, or kill them.
