As Moon Knight, he doles out righteous vengeance, locked in a never-ending battle with both the criminals on the streets and the voices in his head. In Marvel Rivals, Moon Knight wields supernatural powers bestowed by Khonshu to vanquish his foes. </p><p>When crafting Moon Knight’s in-game persona, the development team incorporated a color scheme of white and black, drawing from the rich tapestry of ancient Egyptian mythology linked with Khonshu, and added “Egyptian Faience” material to his costume design, infusing Moon Knight’s appearance with a mystical and exotic allure. Departing from the traditional form-fitting suit seen in the comics, the team integrated technological components and rugged armor motifs into the character’s design. This enhances the visual impact while aligning with the game’s aesthetic, allowing Moon Knight’s aggressive combat style to seamlessly intertwine with the gameplay. Moon Knight can summon a portal above the battlefield, connecting him to the cosmos and summoning the formidable and enigmatic arms of Khonshu, rendering his enemies defenseless.</p></blockquote><p>NetEase also officially announced Shota Nakama as the music producer and arranger for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and Masahiro Aoki as the music composer. Nakama is known for his work on <em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [133 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> XV</em> and <em>Made in Abyss</em>, while Aoki is known for his previous work on <em><a title="Games > Street Fighter V [139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a></em> and <em><a title="Games > Bayonetta 3 [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bayonetta-3">Bayonetta 3</a></em>.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,342 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,666 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/marvel-rivals-182004" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on December 6.</p><!-- AD: content -->
