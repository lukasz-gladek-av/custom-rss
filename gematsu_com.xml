Among the stars, the planet VESTA is discovered, a world that may hold the promise of a new home. To study it, the A.R.E.S. space station is launched into orbit to analyze its potential. But when the station, and the crew, was caught up in a space phenomenon, calamity struck…</p><p>You play as Miranda, who awakens alone aboard the station trapped in a strange phenomenon. With clues of the past echoing through the world: an object out of place, a door newly unlocked, a message left behind almost as if the station itself challenges you. To survive, Miranda must rely on her mind, solving intricate puzzles, experimenting with strange objects, and piecing together the truth behind what happened to her crew and the station itself.</p><p>As Miranda unravels the mystery, one truth becomes clear: progress always has a cost. Rivage is an atmospheric science-fiction puzzle adventure that blends exploration, logic, and narrative discovery into a deeply beautiful experience, where each step brings you closer to escape.</p><!-- AD: content -->

This balance keeps gameplay engaging, rewarding cleverness and persistence over repetition.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Rivage World Premiere &amp; Announcement Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLNwBRHVQxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/science-fiction-puzzle-adventure-rivage-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

A once-thriving society faced a life-threatening enemy when this mysterious mist swept across the lands, warping their minds and consuming everything. In a desperate attempt for survival, those who still stood fled upwards towards the treetops, and rebuilt their homes above the deadly haze. The game’s heavy atmosphere is paired with ambisonic audio cues that intensify the sense of dread, all woven together by the haunting compositions of legendary musician Akira Yamaoka.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><em>Neath</em> is a roguelike tactical RPG set in a decaying world shadowed by an irradiated, inverted tower. Using a fluid turn-based system where the turn order is always shifting, you dictate the actions of both friend and foe alike. As enemies engage you they will freeze your teammates in fear. Disrupt opponents by knocking them away, shove allies far from impending harm, or make the ultimate sacrifice and have someone else take the blow in their stead.</p><p>As you ascend the corrupt citadel to defy the decree of the undivine, your journey will twist and turn with encounters shown through a classic 90’s dungeon-crawler style. Unlock new abilities and challenges that ensure every expedition is unique, and unravel a dark mystery before you succumb to the horrors within.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011525"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Control Every “Moment”</strong> – A unique “engagement-locking” system grips your teammates in fear when they are targeted by enemies, and you must disrupt your foes to save them.
