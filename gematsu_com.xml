This area still includes enemies, hazards, and items just like usual, but you won’t run into other players. You can replay this area as much as you want, but please note: your Body Rank won’t increase while you’re inside. Keep that in mind before you dive in!</li><li><strong>Radar Update</strong> – It will soon be much easier to tell when another player is nearby. Previously, enemies and players appeared the same on the radar, which made it hard to know what you were walking into. With the upcoming update, players will be clearly marked as players, so you’ll always know exactly who you’re dealing with. This feature won’t be available at launch, but it’s actively in development.</li><li><strong>Escape Pods</strong> – We’ve increased the number of Escape Pods and adjusted their placement so players can return once the right conditions are met. The tutorial also wasn’t doing a great job of explaining how the Escape Pod works, so we improved that section to make everything easier to understand.</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong> – We also heard a lot of feedback about motion blur. Many players mentioned that it made things hard to see, so we took that seriously. We’ve improved the overall visual clarity, not just the motion blur, to make everything easier on the eyes and reduce strain. These updates will be ready for release.</li><li><strong>Enemy Behavior</strong> – On the combat side, a number of improvements have been made. Enemy behavior, animations, and spawn patterns were adjusted, and weapon balance, combo flow, and attack range were tuned to match. The goal is to make battles feel more satisfying and to reward players who master the game’s mechanics. Overall, the combat experience should feel smoother, fairer, and a lot more fun.</li></ul><p><strong>Roadmap Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Season Structure</strong> – <em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> will follow a seasonal format, with each season lasting roughly three months. Season 1 will run through February, and Season 2 will begin around March.</li><li><strong>Season Reset</strong> – At the start of each new season, we’ll be implementing a reset. Certain progress will stay intact, such as expanded character slots, storage, and inventory capacity. However, things like collected items, SPLithium-based mastery progress, and other in-run progression will be reset and cleared out once per season.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> <a title="Companies > Enhance [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – The game includes a blueprint-based crafting system, and while we can’t share all the details yet, we are planning a significant upgrade to crafting in Season 2.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Season roadmap is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Season 1</strong> (December 2025 to February 2026)<ul><li><em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> Begins! Hell Gate is Open!</li><li>Exciting New Battle Items</li><li>New Charms</li><li>New Emotes</li></ul></li><li><strong>Season 2</strong> (March to May 2026)<ul><li>Hell Gate Reopens! New Stage Layouts!</li><li>Start Dash Event!</li><li>New Weapons Available!</li><li>Crafting Enhanced!</li><li>New Backpacks</li><li>New Interiors</li><li>New Charms</li><li>New Emotes</li></ul></li><li><strong>Season 3</strong> (June to August 2026)<ul><li>New Stages in Hell Gate! New Enemies / Bosses Unleashed!</li><li>Start Dash Event!</li><li>Even More Weapons / Armor!</li><li>New Features Unveield! Team Content Upgraded!</li><li>New Raider Bodies!</li><li>New Backpacks</li><li>New Interiors</li><li>New Charms</li><li>New Emotes</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> launched today for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,954 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1011123"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536510/The_God_Slayer/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Enter an Eastern-inspired steampunk metropolis where gods known as Celestials reign with a divine fist. In this open-world <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, you are an Elemancer who refuses to bow. Infused with elemental powers and a heart of vengeance, you will dethrone them all. You will rise to be the God Slayer.</p><p><strong>The God Fall</strong></p><p>A long time ago, the Celestials created the world and all its inhabitants. They designed the creatures to cultivate an energy known as qi throughout their lifetimes. Upon death, this enriched qi would be passed to the Celestial realm, empowering them and granting them eternal life.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>However, some curious humans discovered how to harness qi for themselves, transforming it into elemental powers—fire, water, earth, metal, and wood. These practitioners became known as Elemancers. The Celestials were outraged, viewing this as a misuse of what was rightfully theirs. To send a message, they launched a swift and brutal assault on the Zhou Kingdom, the mightiest in the land. In one night, the king and many Elemancers were hunted down and slaughtered. This day became infamously known as the God Fall.</p><p><strong>The Elemeancer</strong></p><p>You play as Cheng, whose family was brutally slain by the Celestials during the God Fall. Now, you must embark on a quest to save your people and avenge your loved ones.</p><p>To achieve this, you will learn to harness and enhance your elemental powers, acquire new skills from ancient scrolls and elemental masters, and refine the flow of qi within you. With dedication, you will gain the power to challenge even the mightiest Celestials.</p><p>In this world, elemental powers interact dynamically: fire consumes wood, water extinguishes fire, steam rises from boiling water, and earth can obstruct. Your approach to utilizing these elemental interactions in battle is entirely up to you!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011128"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Star Fall Society</strong></p><p>Although the Celestials have long been revered as creation gods by the people, their <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s during the God Fall left profound scars on society. Like Cheng, many individuals suffered at the hands of these deities, yet fear keeps the majority in submission.</p><p>However, some brave souls have risen to oppose the conquerors. One such group is the Star Fall Society, led by the wise and enigmatic “<a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter,” supported by a cadre of skilled Elemancers. Their objective is to overthrow the Celestials and reclaim the fate of humanity. In Cheng, they find a willing ally in their cause.</p><p>The Star Fall Society will do whatever it takes to kick the Celestials out of this world.</p><p><strong>The Capital of Zhou</strong></p><p>The game takes place mostly in the capital city of the Zhou Kingdom. It is located at the mouth of two mighty rivers empyting into the Eastern Sea. The city is at its height in steam technology, with an assortment of airships, steamboats, monorails, and steam vehicles. A fortunate few in the upper class now savor the miracle of air-conditioned homes and mechanical washing drums, while in the poor neighborhoods the vast majority still toil in soot-blackened factories or bow beneath the weight of noble privilege.</p><p>In this city with multiple factions each with their own interests at heart. You must cultivate allies, trade in favors, and bribe the right officials to even get the tiniest advantage against the Celestial army and their collaborators. But beware, eyes are everywhere, a single mistake could mean the end of everything you hold dear.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the trailers below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Run for Money: Hunters vs. Runners! Can You Win as Either?</em> first launched for Switch 2 and Switch today in Japan. The Switch 2 and Switch versions also support English and Japanese language options.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>This is an escape <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> that follows the rules of the popular Fuji TV show <em>Run for Money</em>, in which players become Runners and win prize money based on the time spent escaping the Hunters let loose in an enclosed area.</p><p>This game is the first in the series to include a “Hunter Mode” in which the player can aim to become the greatest Hunter. It also supports online play, so players can play against users across the country and compete in the online leaderboards.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Realistic Escape Action Just Like the TV Show</strong></p><p>The game flow is as follows: Runners get a head start to escape, and Hunters are released 30 seconds later. Runners accumulate prize money based on the amount of time they spend escaping, and can of course surrender at any point to keep the prize money accumulated thus far. If the Runners can avoid being captured by a Hunter within the 15-minute time limit, they have successfully escaped. But if a Runner is captured by a Hunter, it is “Game Over!” Can you escape the Hunters until the very end?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Become the Hunter in Hunter Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunter Mode,” which puts players in control of a Hunter, is included for the first time in the series. Players have always dreamed of becoming a Hunter and chasing down and capturing Runners, and now it is finally possible. Become a Hunter, capture Runners, and aim to be the greatest Hunter. Updated Hunters will also appear.</p><p><strong>A Series First: Hunters vs. Runners Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” in which players can choose to play as either a Hunter or Runner, is included for the first time in the series. In order to stop the rampaging Hunters, who have lost control of their power, the Runners must launch a counterattack against the Hunters using weapons obtained in missions. In “Online VS,” up to 12 users can play together (four Hunters, eight Runners). Who will come out on top between the Hyper Hunters Army and the Runners?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Online VS</strong></p><p>Includes an “Online VS” feature that allows up to 12 players to compete for the first time in the series. Users can compete online via quick and simple matchmaking, or play against friends. All five “Runners Mode” and “Hunters vs. Runners Mode” stages can be played online.</p><p><strong>Compete Against Players Across the Country in the Online Leaderboards</strong></p><p>In “Hunter Mode,” your ranking is determined by your score based on how fast you clear the stage. In “Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” your ranking is determined by the total prize money accumulated playing both offline and online.</p><p><strong>High-Variety Game-Original Stages</strong></p><p>The battle stages are all original! There are a total of five stages: “Wonderland,” “Diversity,” “Fantasy,” “The Airport,” and “The Pier.” The events that occur in each stage will trigger various missions, and by completing those missions, your escape may be made easier through things like the escape area expanding or obstructing the release of Hunters.</p><p><strong>Series Mainstays Return</strong></p><p>Popular elements from the series will of course return, including “GameShare” and “Local Communication Play” with up to four players, “Hard Mode” featuring “Hyper Hunters” with enhanced performance, and “Trophy” and “Hunter Figure” collecting.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/run-for-money-hunters-vs-runners-can-you-win-as-either-coming-to-pc-on-january-29-2026]]></content:encoded>
