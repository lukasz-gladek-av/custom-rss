This time, join Moomintroll himself on a charming but cold winter journey.</p><p>When Moomintroll unexpectedly wakes up early from his winter hibernation, he finds himself completely alone for the first time, in a world he barely recognizes. The familiar landscape of Moominvalley is now cloaked in the frosty veil of the Lady of the Cold. Initially seeking someone to care for him and longing to banish winter, young Moomintroll reluctantly embarks on a journey into the unknown, learning to forge new friendships and help those in greater need than himself.</p><p><em>Moomintroll: Winter’s Warmth</em> is a story-driven, cozy puzzle adventure that lets you return to the enchanting Moominvalley through the creative lens of the award-winning indie studio Hyper Games. While not a direct sequel to <em>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</em>, it is a spiritual successor with many similarities. You can enjoy both games on their own, and in any order you’d like.</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><p>In a world of swords, magic, and fairies, you are a lone adventurer who suddenly becomes tasked to revive the ruined kingdom of Almacia along with the Fairy of Time, Chronos.</p><p>Through adventure (action) and revival (strategy), restore the kingdom to its former glory!</p></blockquote><!-- zp_shiv error: no images in gallery! --><blockquote><p><strong>■ Playable Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Imperial</strong></p><p>With high defense, Imperial is your reliable close-range fighter.</p><p>Her shield gives her guard abilities that allow her to safely get into range for her sword. Her easy-to-use skills, together with her unique counter action, give her a high maximum damage output.</p><p><strong>Alchemist</strong></p><p>Alchemist specializes in mixing potions to inflict statuses and other effects on enemies. Change the element of his bottles with a unique action, then inflict the perfect status effect for the situation.</p><p>His skills also apply a variety of debuffs, allowing him to consistently weaken his enemies.</p><p>Conversely, he has few direct attacks, so he’ll need to focus on status effects while he fights.</p><p><strong>Wizard</strong></p><p>Wizard fights from long range using a variety of magic attacks.</p><p>Her charge action can power up her magic before she casts it. Most of her actions will use SP (skill points), so you’ll need to keep an eye on it.</p><p>Her health and defense is low, so positioning is of utmost importance.</p><p><strong>Zipangu</strong></p><p>Skilled at attacking and dodging, Zipangu’s specialty is consecutive attacks.</p><p>He can get in close with a dodge move, then press the attack harder than any other character.</p><p>What he wants to do is rather simple: dodge, then attack back. However, his defense is lacking, so failing to dodge will be painful.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
