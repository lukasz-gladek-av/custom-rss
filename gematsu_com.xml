      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Walaber Entertainment" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/walaber-entertainment">Walaber Entertainment</a> has announced&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit-dx">Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX</a></em>, an enhanced version of its 2024-released&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Parking Garage Rally Circuit" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a></em> with twice the amount of content. It is available today for $14.99 via the launched marketplace <a href="https://wavedash.gg/walaber-entertainment/pgrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wavedash</a>, which allows you to play games in your browser with no client download or special hardware required. A release will follow for unspecified consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam in 2026. <span id="more-1015273"></span></p><p>“What started as the idea of delivering a little more content for <em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit</em> has expanded into what is effectively a whole new game that doubles the size of the original,” said Walaber Entertainment founder Tim Fitzrandolph in a press release. “I’m really excited that <em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX</em> is part of the launch of a new platform in Wavedash that reduces friction and complexity for players to discover and play games like mine. I look forward to coming back next year with more news on bringing <em>DX</em> and the European Tour to Steam and console players.”</p><div id="carousel_1015278"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Walaber Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX</em> doubles the content of the original release with the addition of the new European Tour, adding eight multistorey car parks to drift through on top of the original eight American parking garages to make a total of 16 tracks.</p><p>Visit multistory car parks in Paris (Art Car Park), York (York Castle Car Park), Turin (Car Factory), Montpellier (Double Loop), Hamburg (Concert Hall), Copenhagen (Power Plant), Geneva (Parking Tour), and Naples (<a title="Companies > CAVE Interactive [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cave-interactive">Cave</a> Park) as you drift and boost your way to victory in the single-player mode, or against other players online. These locations are all inspired by real multistorey carparks, though the odd underwater tunnel or falling stalactites may suggest a touch of artistic liberty. Do it all to a full new soundtrack from The Holophonics, the band behind the catchy tunes that graced the original game.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Designed to look, feel and sound like a lost <a title="Companies > SEGA [2,724 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">SEGA</a> Saturn game that could have been released in 1998, <em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX</em> delivers delightfully fun <a title="Genres > Racing [313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> that’s easy to pick up and play with its chainable <em>Mario Kart</em>-style boosts, but requires skill to master as you unlock new car classes and compete to top the leaderboards. Head online to create and join lobbies of up to eight players and race on any track, with any car class, gaining points after each race. The game also features an arcade-style “Endurance” mode where you keep doing laps until you run out of time and cheat codes to discover that unlock fun modifiers, as well as special cars and tracks.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

The Gendarmerie Tank is a heavy hitter with powerful ranged and charge attacks, while Gendarmerie Officers are strong enemies that summon reinforcements and launch attacks from every angle.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,079 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,344 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/851850/DRAGON_BALL_Z_KAKAROT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
