One of these is Mono’s skill “Turn Over,” which allows her to manipulate the colored parts of the world that Mel cannot eat.</p><p><em>—When you Turn Over a spot where the page is slightly lifted…</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_054.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Part of the background will flip open with a whap! revealing hidden passageways and items!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_055.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can even slip into the shadows behind a turned-over background to evade giant monsters.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_056.jpg"></a></figure><p>By Turning Over parts of the world, you can uncover new paths hidden on the other side—or use the flipped background to hide from enemies. There are many ways to interact with picture-book worlds beyond simply “eating and destroying.”</p><p><strong>■ At The End of Each Stage, You Will Fight a Completely Changed Girl…</strong></p><p>As you progress deeper through each stage, gathering “Memory Bookmarks” that tell the girls’ story, you will encounter a girl transformed by her trauma into a “Shinigami Princess.” Defeat the Shinigami Princess and free the girl from her trauma.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_057.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ The First Stage’s Shinigami Princess</strong></p><p><strong>Shepherdess Girl / Ookami Princess</strong> (voiced by Tsunomaki Watame)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_058.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shinigami-Hime-to-Ishokan-no-Kaibutsu_2025_11-20-25_061.png"></a></figure><p>A girl who has transformed into a giant, sheep-like monster known as the “Ookami Princess.”</p><p>Born as the eldest daughter of a shepherding family, she is a hardworking girl devoted to her family.
