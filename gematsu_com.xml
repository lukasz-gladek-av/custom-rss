A 10 percent-off launch sale will be held for the first week of launch. <span id="more-1016419"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4215730/__in/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Wonderful maze “HoloDungeon” changes form with each challenge—within it lurks Hollow, beings not unlike Holomen. To rescue her snatched friends and make special Live a success, Hakui Koyori tries an unknown <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>! A roguelike RPG where you play using wisdom and brains remain even after down.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>With the special live performance just around the corner, Hakui Koyori was living a hectic life, her heart filled with both uncontrollable excitement and anxiety.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Just as most of the meticulous planning was complete, the world suddenly transformed into the mysterious labyrinth known as the “HoloDungeon.”</p><p>“Oh noooooo! Help me, Koyoriii!”</p><p>“La, Lap-chan!?”</p><p>And soon after the incident began, a fellow member of the same secret society was too quick kidnapped. Can Koyori save her friends and successfully hold the special live performance…</p><p><strong>HoloDungeon</strong></p><p>The HoloDungeon is a dungeon that shifts its form like a hologram. Layers are automatically generated, ensuring no adventure is ever repeated twice. A fresh and exciting experience awaits you every time.</p><p>If you fall in the dungeon, you will lose many things gained during that adventure, such as picked-up items and experience points. However, the knowledge gained from that adventure will surely help you on your next one.</p><p>Also, “Dungeon <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Points” are not lost even if you fall in a dungeon, and the “Decorate Recipes” obtained by paying these points are also important keys to clearing the dungeon.</p><p><strong>Hollow</strong></p><p>An existence not dissimilar to Hololive talents, yet replicated by someone being. The Hollows, each possessing diverse ability and characteristics, await the protagonist, Koyori.</p><p>However, if you can fully understand Hollow’s unique character, you might be able to use that to your advantage in your strategy.</p><p><strong>Items and Dungeon Traps</strong></p><p>Items and traps found while exploring HoloDungeon are packed with Hololive elements!</p><p>Even items or traps that seem tricky at first look may become your savior in a pinch, if utilized properly. Of course, the reverse is also true.</p><p><strong>Decorate System</strong></p><p>By using “Koyorinium” accumulated during dungeon exploration, you can blended new medicine or perform “Decorate” to dramatically enhance the performance of weapons and armor.</p><p>These effects are extremely powerful and can serve as a trump card to decisively break through seemingly deadlocked situations.</p><p>Items with weak or disadvantageous effects can also serve as important “Decorate” materials, bringing a fresh sense of strategy to dungeon exploration.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a recent trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="主人公博衣こより『ホロダンジョン 博衣こよりとホロウライブ in ホンシャタワー』新作ローグライク公式トレーラー【holo Indie】#ホロインディー #hololive #ホロライブ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyOvBp0Qg48?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/holodungeon-koyori-vs-hollow-live-in-honsha-tower-launches-in-early-access-on-january-22-2026]]></content:encoded>
