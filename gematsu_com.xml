The final official report contained only scraps of information:</p><p>…experiment #347 has reached critical parameters… …transportation of the sample from Sector D to████████████… …stability indicators are dropping… …WARNING… …containment conditions have been breached… …personnel evacuated from Levels 6 to 9… …OH GOD, █████████ IS REAL… …TIME CAN ████… …IT’S NOT A VACUUM, IT’S WATCHING US…</p><p>Your squad’s mission is to reach ICE-1 Station, located deep under thick layers of ice. This is a place where hundreds of scientists, soldiers, and researchers lived and worked. Within its depths are hidden things that can obliterate the boundary between reality and insanity. And if even one of those objects gets out of the station, it will mark the end of the world as we know it.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>A Profound Story From a <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Creator</strong></p><p>A whole new world from the masterful pen of Guiltythree, author of the cult web novel Shadow Slave, awaits you in Critical Shift. His work is renowned for its rich character development, dark atmosphere, and genuinely unexpected plot twists. In our game, the writer reinterprets familiar events, intertwining them with mystery and throwing the heroes into a dizzying vortex full of lethal danger, drama, treachery, and a whole lot more!</p><p><strong>Hardcore Tactical Battle System</strong></p><p>Lead a squad created to solve impossible problems.

In the shadows, meanwhile, hide creatures whose origin is entirely inexplicable. Exploit the conflicts between the different factions wisely—within these walls, any move can turn the tide of battle!</p><p><strong>Explore the World</strong></p><p>The gigantic underground complex stretches for miles beneath the Antarctic ice.
