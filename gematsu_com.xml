It’s been a joy reading all your comments across the various community channels.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Our ongoing Persistent Closed Beta is also continuing in full force, with regular updates, and the feedback we’ve been collecting from beta testers has been invaluable in making sure we can launch a quality game. We have a very active Discord going with our beta testers where our developers can interact directly with them to ensure we collaboratively make <em>Dune: Awakening</em> a better game.</p><p>Thanks to this process, we’ve concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers.</p><p>As such, we will be moving the release date of <em>Dune: Awakening</em> to June 10, with head start launching on June 5. This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one.</p><p>We’re also excited about the fact that this will allow us to do a large-scale beta weekend next month where even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback. We will release more information about this soon.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is a beast of a game. This is <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [487 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> survival on a massive scale, and we’re making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to tune in to today’s livestream on Steam, YouTube, and Twitch, where our developers will be showing and talking more about the combat in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p><p>With best regards from the entire <em>Dune: Awakening</em> team here at Funcom</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
