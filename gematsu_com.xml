Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p><p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p><p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p><p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p><p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p><p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Fixes to Player Controls<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie <a title="Companies > Dodge Roll [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/dodge-roll">Dodge Roll</a> from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li></ul></li><li>Fixes to Multiplayer<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/splatoon-3-version-11-0-0-update-launches-january-29]]></content:encoded>
