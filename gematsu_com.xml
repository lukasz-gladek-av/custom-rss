        <p>Choose your Stalker—each with their own story, personality, and skills—and descend into the Witch’s cursed dungeon. Enter solo or with trusted companions in teams of up to three. As you explore, gather loot, fight off corrupted monsters, and clash with rival Stalkers, your ultimate goal is to escape alive. But beware: no two runs are alike. The Witch’s Curse system dynamically alters dungeon conditions every session, changing the odds—and the challenges.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Armor Destruction System</strong> – As characters take damage, this is represented visually with degraded armor and can be seen by enemy players, adding tension and strategic depth on how and when to engage.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Witch’s Curse System</strong> – The Witch’s Curse changes dungeon conditions multiple times per session. Each 5 minute phase can bestow buffs, debuffs, summon power monsters or change rules on at moment’s notice</li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – Choose between a lighter, fun and casual player-versus-environment experience or hardcore competitive player-versus-environment-versus-player dungeon run modes to suit your style and do so with teammates or solo.</li><li><strong>Play as Unique Stalkers</strong> – Select from a roster of vivid, story-driven characters with diverse abilities and discover the story behind why each of them has found themselves here and unfold the secrets to the dungeon itself!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dungeon-stalkers-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-on-august-13]]></content:encoded>
