Set in a rich post-apocalyptic fantasy landscape across four distinct global regions, drivers will battle against the clock through 20 levels, each with hairpin turns, branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces. The clock isn’t all you’ll have to worry about as you race through the badlands—stay alert and fight off other road-raging enemies with your arsenal of weapons, or bash them off the road with a selection of seven different vehicles.</p><p>In the aftermath of a comet collision that bathed Earth in deadly radiation, humanity’s remnants have formed fierce factions of wasteland warriors. In <em>Fatal Run 2089</em>, you join a courageous group of scientists known as the ‘Engineers.’ Your critical mission: transport ARCs—advanced clean energy devices designed to purify the atmosphere—to essential population hubs worldwide.</p><p>As you take the wheel of your chosen vehicle, the urgency mounts. Your ARC’s integrity is diminishing with every passing moment, but deft maneuvering and bold driving will help recharge the device. Keep your foot on the gas and your weapons primed, for in this post-apocalyptic chaos, a new elite force has emerged, determined to halt your progress. Time is running out—will you deliver the salvation the world so desperately needs?</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
