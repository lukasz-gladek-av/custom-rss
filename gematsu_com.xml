Maybe you should do something about the ominous voices coming from the shrine next to the cafe, or you could get the whole town involved in a large-scale campaign to bring in even more business. All sorts of events await you and the maids!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Maid-Cafe-on-Electric-Street_2024_11-05-24_013.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Maid-Cafe-on-Electric-Street_2024_11-05-24_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager!</strong></p><p>As the manager, your job is to, of course, manage the cafe and the maids.</p><p>First, you’ll have to allocate work to your maids.
