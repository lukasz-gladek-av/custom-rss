And worse yet, monsters inhabiting the “Glitches” are said to replace users in the real world leaving everyone none the wiser.</p><p>The protagonist soon discovers that this urban legend is very real and some students have already been replaced by monsters, forcing them to take a stand. As a member of the Student Support Services (SSS), a guild dedicated to solving the academy’s troubles, players must guide their friends, strengthen bonds, and fight to protect the school from impending doom. However, navigating these relationships comes with its own challenges—getting too close to multiple people may lead to unexpected consequences.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the core of <em>VARLET</em>‘s experience is its dynamic Triad Stats system, which shapes character progression based on player choices. These six distinct attributes are divided between Light and Dark Triad traits, influencing dialogue options and passive battle skills. Light Triad stats emphasize morality, sympathy, and altruism, while Dark Triad stats lean into Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Players will determine their true nature, either as a guiding leader who uplifts and empowers allies in battle or as a ruthless ruler wielding immense power even at a personal cost.</p></blockquote><p>The game’s staff includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Character Theme Song Composers</strong><ul><li>Daibakuhashin</li><li>Hitoshizuki and Yamasankakkei</li><li><a title="Games > Kanon [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kanon">KANON</a>69</li><li>NILFRUITS</li><li>OSTER project</li><li>Tadano Kede / A4.</li><li>wotaku</li><li>Yoshida Yasei</li></ul></li><li><strong>Background Music:</strong> Tsukasa <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>uko</li><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Gakuto Mikumo, Ryutaro Ito</li><li><strong>Scenario Editing:</strong> Kazunari Suzuki</li><li><strong>Series Original Work:</strong> Fuyuki Hayashi</li><li><strong>Production:</strong> FuRyu</li><li><strong>Development:</strong> AQURIA</li><li><strong>Produce and Direction:</strong> Hideaki Ito</li><li><strong>Direction:</strong> Takashi Muto</li></ul><p>An “Announcement Presentation” live stream will premiere on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250425T1200" target="_blank">April 25 at 5:00 a.m. PT / 8:00 a.m. ET / 21:00 JST</a>, featuring the premiere of the opening movie and the latest information on the game with the voice cast.
