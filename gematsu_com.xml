Be someone important?<br>Do you want to make some money and become rich?</p><p>If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you’re in luck! You’ve been invited to join The Primate Observation Club. Live out all your heart’s desires as the newest member and if you are already in the Club, it’s time to move up the ladder.</p><p>Observe the monkeys behind cages from the comfort of your home, stash some cash with your side hustle jobs, and maybe even play the role of a divine being by manipulating the lives of your subjects.

Send your clones on procedurally generated missions and build them into cybernetic gods in mere minutes as you cut your way through hundreds of blood-thirsty mutants, drug-addled <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and mechanized soldiers. Gather resources for permanent upgrades, recruit allies, make alliances, research forbidden technologies and do your best to prepare for inevitable catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Morgan Lee—leader of a ragtag band of resistance fighters on a prison planet Sigma. Used to house the most dangerous criminals from all known star systems, Sigma is now locked into an endless quarantine after discovery of the Substance—an ever-adapting mass of rogue nano-bots infected by a malicious alien life form. A generation later, the planet is controlled by several factions fighting for domination.</p><p>In the beginning of the game, Sigma is shaken by an unprecedented event—a catastrophic breach of the Substance inside the planet’s only mega-city, housing not only convicts, but also management of various corporations operating on the planet. Everyone is a prisoner now. As the situation escalates and technical systems that control life on Sigma begin to fail, it’s every faction for themselves.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Structure</strong></p><p>In <em>KIBORG</em> the clock is always ticking. Each mission you undertake costs you a day, regardless of its results, and every week or so, new calamity strikes. You must choose your actions carefully, balancing risks and rewards. With your every decision, with each victory and each loss, the story is moving forward. There is no “game over” screen to see and no previous save to load. You must learn to live with the consequences of your actions.</p><p><strong>Roguelite</strong></p><p>Missions are, for the most part, procedurally generated. You never know what enemies and challenges you’ll face. With dozens of enemy types, hundreds of combat modifiers and a plethora of non-combat encounters, no mission is the same.</p><p><strong>Better Killing Through Tech</strong></p><p>Vasiliy uses a piece of future tech called The Cradle to send his clones on each mission. Even if a clone dies, Vasiliy stays unharmed. Clones are equipped with nano-skeleton, that can absorb tech from the fallen enemies and transform it into a variety of cybernetic implants. There are seven implant slots and eight possible implants for each slot. It results in thousands of possible combinations where no build is the same. And all these combinations are visual—they won’t only change how Vasiliy fights, but also how he looks—something that almost no <a title="Genres > Roguelite [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">rogue-lite</a> has done before. And as if it wasn’t enough, there are also hundreds of augmentations—invisible micro-implants that take no slot—to fine-tune your build!</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>When fists start flying, Vasiliy isn’t limited to cyber-tech only. The hand-to-hand combat is as deep, as it is brutal, with a wide variety of defensive and offensive options. Dodge, block and parry enemy strikes, mix different combos and special attacks, use your environment to devastate your enemies. Swing various melee weapons to gain a bloody edge over your opponents or just shoot them in the face with one of the many powerful firearms. But manage your resources carefully: ammo is scarce, melee weapons can break easily, defensive options drain your stamina while special strikes cost energy that you recharge with basic attacks.</p><p><strong>Take a Moment to Rest</strong></p><p>Your base is your fortress, a haven between missions. Chat with your allies (all with strong, eclectic personalities), listen in to their conversations or to news broadcasts, meditate in the garden, admire your collection of trophies, train in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [206 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>. Or craft power upgrades to help you in combat.</p><p>Because in <em>KIBORG</em>, the clock is always ticking.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kiborg - Nintendo Switch Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbfT2hgBvjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kiborg-coming-to-switch-on-december-9]]></content:encoded>

The PlayStation 5 and Switch versions will also be released phsysically. <span id="more-1002619"></span></p><p><em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> first launched in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on April 10, 2024. A full release date has yet to be announced.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a challenging city builder which tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands. During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom - Console Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDfEOCRXx_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/laysara-summit-kingdom-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch]]></content:encoded>

With a suit armed to the nines, Robot can keep enemies at a distance with his missiles and wrist cannons, while swiftly maneuvering throughout the game using his Beam Blasts and Disruptor to lay on damage. His shoulder cannons unleash deadly homing missiles that force opponents to block in place, granting extra time for Robot to call in assists, set up tech or prepare a mighty assault. Robot can deliver precision laser strikes from long range and call in his hoverbike to stun enemies. Versatile, intelligent and a formidable weapon, Robot is an advanced fighter to have on your team.</p><p><strong>Monster Girl</strong></p><p>Afflicted by a curse, Amanda acquired the extraordinary ability to shift between human form and that of a monster. But this power came at a cost, as each transformation causes her human form to age backward. Undeterred, she proves to be an absolute brute on the battlefield as Monster Girl. Her immense size and strength allow her to tear down opponents, utilizing a combination of grapple attacks, head-spinning hits, in-air blows, body slams and more. And just when her enemies think they’re reaching victory, Monster Girl’s relentless nature allows her to come back even stronger.
