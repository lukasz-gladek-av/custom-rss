The core development team is a mix of newcomers and industry veterans that have worked on games such as <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and movies like <em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;and <em>Flash</em>.</p><p><strong>What is Unleash the Avatar?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is an Indian Epic Soulslike set in an alternate timeline featuring flashy, intense combat against legendary foes.</p><p><strong>What’s <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story about? What’s my character called?</strong></p><p>While it’s a little too early for us to reveal all of <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story, what we can say is, the game takes place in an age where the barrier between Naraka (Hell) and Earth has eroded and both Asuras and Rakshasas—have found their way to Earth. Imbued with a sliver of Lord Vishnu’s power, it is up to you to restore balance to the universe by putting an end to the demons’ sinister plans.</p><p><strong>Why is there an alternate India setting in this trailer that’s more inline with high fantasy instead of the relatively modern setting of the first trailer?</strong></p><p>The first trailer was meant to be a test of our photogrammetry systems and a public showing of our intent to work on a title from India.</p><p>Following feedback from our fans we felt the alternate high fantasy, Indian Epics-inspired setting you see now is more in line with the story we want to tell—and what our fans want to see—from a game like ours.</p><p><strong>What can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on? Can I wishlist it now?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,525 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch. Stay tuned to our Steam page reveal and wishlist us to support what we do.</p><p><strong>Do I have to pay to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is a premium, one-time purchase. No battle passes. No loot boxes. No daily grind. No dark patterns.</p><p><strong>When will I be able to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>Remember that this is our first production title so we may not be super accurate with our launch dates as it is hard to tell right now. Internally however, we’re on course for a 2026 launch window. We’re currently in the production phase so we do have playtests every now and then. If you would like to be a part of these, keep an eye on our socials for playtest announcement dates.</p><p><strong>Can I make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>? Will you copyright strike my channel? Is there an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program?</strong></p><p>Yes you can make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and no we won’t copyright strike your channel.

We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.</p><p><strong>Can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on the Steam Deck / ROG Ally / Xbox ROG Ally X / Lenovo Legion Go 2?</strong></p><p>We’re big fans of handheld PCs and we’d love to bring <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> to Steam Deck and other devices as well. Right now though, our focus is solely on desktops and laptop-grade computers.</p><p><strong>Is AI used in making <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>If you’re referring to enemy AI systems that are a cornerstone of every soulslike, yes those exist. If you’re asking if we’re using generative AI tools to make Unleash the Avatar, the answer is no. The game is handcrafted with love by fans of the genre, using gen AI would be a disservice to soulslikes and their fans.</p><p><strong>Is there anything new that we get to see in <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> that isn’t in other games?</strong></p><p>Built from first principles, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> runs on several custom systems: a fragmented-chakra engine with its own physics, enemy AI that knows when to reset posture, when to press, and how hard to push (tuned centrally), and a rigorously engineered parry model. Add generous chances to aura farm, and you get a soulslike that feels familiar, yet unmistakably new. We’ve also manually scanned countless photogrammetry assets from old towns in India specifically for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>, so enjoy an authentic reconstruction of India in a video game!</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/indian-epics-inspired-soulslike-action-rpg-unleash-the-avatar-early-alpha-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
