Now they are swarming our cities, terrorizing citizens, and destroying our infrastructure. It’s time to rise up and take arms and fight for the precious foundations and soil of Democracy manifest. Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours.</p><p><strong>Super Earth… Our Home</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The urban sprawl of Super Earth is the site of the conflict. Fight among the towering skyscrapers and crowded streets of our home turf as the Illuminate rain down destruction all around you.</p><p>Inside the city biomes, you will tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns.</p><p><strong>Repel the Invasion</strong></p><p>The Helldivers are tasked with a new objective: to repel the Illuminate invasion by gaining ground over the squids as they fight to control areas where the fleet is landing. It won’t be a walk in the park, divers. Like a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, you will struggle against the incoming forces, gaining and losing control quickly.</p><p><strong>Arm the Cannons</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Even in the face of such danger, we are not helpless, and all is not lost. The might of Super Earth’s arsenal lies hidden beneath our peaceful, democratic streets. With your help, we must activate our Planetary Defense Cannons and take down the Illuminate fleet in a grand show of power.</p><p><strong>Call for Backup</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>It’s all hands on deck as you encounter SEAF troops who will help join the fight to defend our Freedom. These small squads will fight enemies on their own, or they can be ordered to follow Helldivers and provide temporary backup as you navigate toward objectives. Salute and lead them on the path to victory, divers!</p><p><strong>Protect Citizens</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, you must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. They may be panicked, Helldivers, but it is your sworn duty to keep them safe and they look to you as the ultimate protectors of liberty. Remember: any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p><p><strong>Prepare for the Fight</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Last week, we released a powerful primary weapon customization system and expanded surplus options to fight against the Illuminate as they emerged from the singularity. Now that you have learned the tactics of these new squid troops—like the Crescent Overseer and the hulking Fleshmob—you must master these tools to continue the fight on Super Earth. Use every available resource, divers, and decimate their forces!</p><p>Our major update, “Heart of Democracy,” is now live. Helldivers, to your hellpods immediately! Citizens, enlistment centers will remain open for recruitment.</p></blockquote><p><em>Helldivers II</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,494 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,158 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p><h2><span>“Heart of Democracy” Update Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Heart of Democracy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmXtgHs2ODg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>“Heart of Democracy” Update Deep Dive</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Heart of Democracy Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pPGgHieWok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
