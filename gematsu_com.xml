Pre-registration is available now. <span id="more-1000219"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>We know you’re super excited to dash, jump, and compete in the ultimate <a title="Genres > Arcade [94 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> royale, and guess what? So are we! Our whole journey to get this game ready for you has been all about one thing: making a game that truly lives up to the Sonic name and totally deserves your passion.</p><p>When you cross the starting line this November, you get to experience the best game we could possibly deliver to our fans. Over the last few months, <em>Sonic Rumble</em> has seriously evolved, with every single change aimed at making your experience better. This extra development time allowed us to roll out several, player-focused updates that refined the core game from the ground up. The goal? A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump.</p><p>We took feedback directly from our Early Rumblers and have made major improvements in three key areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Building a Deeper, More Dynamic Core</strong> – We added some awesome features that boost the competitive play. Use iconic skills to obstruct your opponents, and join a Crew with your friends to participate in time-limited events and earn extra rewards. Plus, we added a ton of new stages and new game modes, to keep the arcade royale chaos always at its peak.</li><li><strong>Refining and Streamlining the Journey</strong> – We completely revamped the new player onboarding journey to get new Rumblers into the <a title="Genres > Action [3,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> faster. We also drastically improved the user interface by putting all mission and achievement-related tasks into one easy-to-navigate hub, so you spend more time playing and less time searching.</li><li><strong>Improving Progression and Rewards</strong> – We carefully updated and simplified the cosmetic and character progression systems, making sure every unlock feels meaningful and impactful, while making upgrades less of a chore. We also fine-tuned the game’s rewards and shop systems to create a clear, generous, and exciting progression path for all players. This even included expanding the score ranks and simplifying certain achievements to make every accomplishment feel like a celebrated win.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>These adjustments were key in making <em>Sonic Rumble</em> awesome for the long haul. Even as we get ready for launch, our commitment continues and there will be plenty more to come!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Sonic Rumble – The ultimate Arcade Royale Arrives This November!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FP6XoAMZYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/sonic-rumble-launches-in-november]]></content:encoded>

There are new challenges to overcome, new strategies to plan, and now with an upgraded look and feel for a new generation of explorers.</p><p>All you need for this relaunched mission to create a thriving Martian settlement is a steady supply of resources, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms… and a curious attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!</p><p><em>Surviving Mars: Relaunched</em> brings together the original colony management game from Haemimont Games, its entire catalogue of expansions, improved and reworked, from major expansions to cosmetics and radio stations, as well as the all-new Martian Assembly update.
