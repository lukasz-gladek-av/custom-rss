      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Coatsink [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/coatsink">Coatsink</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > ISLANDERS: New Shores" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/islanders-new-shores">ISLANDERS: New Shores</a></em>, a follow-up to its acclaimed minimalist strategy city builder <em>ISLANDERS</em>. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,963 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,808 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,721 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,492 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/" target="_blank">Steam</a> this summer. <span id="more-947433"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coatsink:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> recreates the relaxing atmosphere and streamlined strategy that made the original such a hit, and builds on those foundations with new mechanics, modes, and features.</p><p><em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> invites you back to a world of tranquil creativity that welcomes longtime fans and newcomers to explore, build, and strategize like never before. In <em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em>, you are presented with a series of beautiful islands to build on, starting each level with an inventory of buildings to choose from. Carefully consider where to place them to get the most points over the course of the stage as you unlock more structures as part of an experience that reigns in the overwhelming complexity of the sprawling city-builder to deliver minimalist shots of short yet cerebral strategy.</p><p>Let’s unroll the blueprints and take a look at the new features <em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> is bringing too! One key new feature is the introduction of “boons.” Boons are one-time power ups unlocked on each stage as you collect points, offering a helping hand that will become vital as you take on the game’s tricker levels. Boons can allow you to duplicate buildings in your inventory and replace buildings you’ve already built. There’s more for you to discover yourself in the full game, with each boon offering an intriguing new twist on how you go about building your city.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> also features the new Sandbox mode, new building types to play with, advanced scoring mechanics, and unique island properties. There’s also a Photo Mode with filters and a turntable camera for you to capture snaps of your aesthetically pleasing creations on the stunning natural landscapes <em>ISLANDERS: New Shores</em> offers up.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bandai Namco Entertainment [6,650 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> filed trademarks for “Once Upon a KATAMARI” on February 27 in <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019149143" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and “Gekishin Squadra” on February 14 in the <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99041762&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank">United States</a> and <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019143008" target="_blank">Europe</a>. <span id="more-947566"></span></p><p>The Japanese publisher is notorious for trademarking game titles ahead of official announcements. Recent trademarks discovered by <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> before their official announcements include “Time Stranger” (<em><a title="Games > Digimon Story: Time Stranger [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a></em>), “Nightreign” (<em><a title="Games > Elden Ring Nightreign [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>), and “Battle Destiny” (<em><a title="Games > Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Battle Destiny Remastered [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mobile-suit-gundam-seed-battle-destiny-remastered">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Battle Destiny Remastered</a></em>), “Operation Memories” (<em><a title="Games > SPYxANYA: Operation Memories [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/spyxanya-operation-memories">SPYxANYA: Operation Memories</a></em>), “Fractured Daydream” (<em><a title="Games > Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sword-art-online-fractured-daydream">Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream</a></em>), and “<em><a title="Games > Shadow Labyrinth [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a></em>.” Bandai Namco also trademarked “<a title="Games > Tales of Arise [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise: Beyond the Dawn</a>” and “<em><a title="Games > We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/we-love-katamari-reroll-royal-reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie</a></em>” before their announcements.</p><p>While recent <em>Katamari</em> series releases have been <em>REROLL</em>—or remastered—versions of previous games, “Once Upon a KATAMARI” could be the first new entry since <em>Touch My Katamari</em> for <a title="Platforms > PS Vita [7,378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vita">PS Vita</a> in 2011.</p><p>As for “Gekishin Squadra,” while the title may sound similar to <em><a title="Series > Dragon Ball [74 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/dragon-ball">Dragon Ball</a> Z II: Gekishin Freeza</em>, which launched for <a title="Platforms > NES [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/nes">Famicom</a> in 1991, “Gekishin” is not a <em>Dragon Ball</em>-specific term, so what it could be for remains to be seen.</p><p>Speaking of Bandai Namco, at least two somewhat recent trademarks have yet to be revealed as games—“<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/01/bandai-namco-trademarks-towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-in-europe">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a>” and “<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/mihoyo-trademarks-astaweave-haven-bandai-namco-trademarks-case-mirage-in-japan">case. mirage</a>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
