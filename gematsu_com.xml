            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Canyons</em> is a cooperative player-versus-environment game set in a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic world where <a title="Genres > Survival [480 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is only possible in the canyons. Play solo or gather a team of up to four players. Arm yourselves to the teeth, grab supplies, and set out to conquer the canyons on massive Crawlers.</p><p><strong>Crawlers</strong></p><p>The vast waters disappeared hundreds of years ago, but the spirit of the pioneer ancestors and their inventions remain timeless. Become the captain of a Crawler—a colossal machine from the past, essential for traversing the canyons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Modify, upgrade, and develop your steel companion! <a title="Games > Unless" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/unless">Unless</a>, of course, you find a better friend—here, sentimentality has no place.</p><p><strong>Expeditions</strong></p><p>Welcome to a world teeming with dangers, endless storms, scorching sun, fearsome creatures, and humans steeped in cruelty. You’re very welcome here, especially if you’re tasty. Gather loyal friends, load ammo onto your rusty Crawler, and embark on expeditions to conquer, save, build, or destroy these damned canyons. Will you risk everything for legendary rewards, or will you wisely return home when things get tough? The choice is yours. There are no right decisions or proven paths here, but there is a complex procedural generation system with hand-crafted details and unique events that will let you feel the crunch of sand under your scurvy-ridden teeth over and over again.</p><p><strong><a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong></p><p>No matter how brave a warrior you are, one day you’ll have to return home. Establish your settlement in the canyon caves, equip it with everything survivors need, and they will gladly settle there. Build a shipyard for Crawler construction, garages for repair and tuning, an armory, or a fancy cafeteria with zombie burgers. Create infrastructure for traders, medics, workers, and more! And of course, ensure the protection of your home haven, as there will always be those who covet what you have.</p><p><strong>Captain</strong></p><p>Shooting is good, but shooting well is even better, and to achieve this, you must develop your captain. Besides improving basic stats, you can master dozens of professions, each enhancing your character in some aspect of the game.</p><p>While shooting bottles and lifting weights, don’t forget about morality. The canyons are a harsh place, often forcing difficult choices. How will you treat a survivor dying of thirst? Give them precious water, take them to your harbor, rob them, leave them to the monsters, or even eat them yourself? The decision is yours! But remember, everything has consequences.</p><p><strong>Inhabitants</strong></p><p>No matter how crazy an idea seems, it will always gather a group of followers. The canyons are no exception. The crowd here is peculiar. Lawmen, Marauders, the Diesel Cult, and many others await you on their lands. Or don’t—they might react uniquely to your actions and morality score. Find common ground with them, and they will aid you. For example, the Lawmen can provide the best equipment, the Diesel Cult can grant access to the finest transport and Crawler modules, and the Sun Fanatics will simply blow your head off—they are hated by everyone, and the feeling is mutual.</p><p>Of course, humans are not the only inhabitants of these lands. In the canyons, you will encounter Shrivelled, Creepers, Savages, and many other creatures that mothers use to scare misbehaving children.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/canyons-gameplay-teaser-trailer-co-op-pve-third-person-shooter-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>
