The 30,000 souls who call this place home have disappeared without a trace.

You are a cybernetic mercenary venturing into the unknown in a fight for <a title="Genres > Survival [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and fortune where any run can lead to greatness.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>The World of Marathon</strong></p><p>In <em>Marathon</em>, players inhabit a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary scouring the remains of a lost colony of Tau Ceti IV for fortune and power. Players team up in crews of three as they battle rival Runner teams and hostile security forces for weapons and upgrades. Survive and everything they’ve scavenged is theirs to keep for future runs on Tau Ceti IV—or if they’re brave enough, a journey to the derelict Marathon ship that hangs above.</p><p><strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong></p><p>Welcome to Tau Ceti IV, a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions compete for the resources left behind, hiring Runners who’ve given up their human form for biosynthetic shells. Death is but a hurdle in this cutthroat competition where power, fortune, and answers to Tau Ceti IV’s mysteries hang in the balance.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_957952"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Become a Runner</strong></p><p>Choose from a roster of cybernetic mercenaries with unique abilities. Players customize their Runner’s playstyle with the weapons, implants, and equipment they collect on their runs. Strategize, execute, and become Tau Ceti’s most feared mercenary.</p><p><strong>A High-Stakes Journey to Grow in Power</strong></p><p>Bungie’s best-in-class first-person shooter gunplay sets the stage for a unique mix of tactical and fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,663 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, where every run is a tense competition for a big score. End game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more await in Season 1.</p><p><strong>Cinematic Short</strong></p><p>The first, original cinematic short set in the <em>Marathon</em> universe debuted, displaying the team’s commitment to rich storytelling both in and out of the game. This cinematic short was written and directed by the award-winning director Alberto Mielgo and his animation studio pinkman.tv.</p><p>“When I first read about <em>Marathon</em>‘s universe and characters, I found everything strangely poetic and mysterious,” said Alberto Mielgo. “The concepts of futility and endurance immediately came to mind, and I felt an urgent need to write about it. Seeing the game team’s super bold and vibrant artwork created an instant connection. It’s all deeply inspiring and thought-provoking.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers and today’s gameplay showcase live stream below.
