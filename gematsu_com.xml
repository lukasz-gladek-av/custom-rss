It will launch on March 18, with early access for Digital Deluxe Edition buyers beginning March 14. Unlike previous years, <em>MLB The Show 25</em> will not be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-940834"></span></p><p>Paul Skenes, Elly De La Cruz, and Gunnar Henderson will be featured on <em>MLB The Show 25</em>‘s first-ever three-athlete cover. Here are short profiles for each player:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Paul Skenes</strong>&nbsp;– Paul Skenes’ journey began in high school and continued through college, where he cemented his status as one of the most talented young pitchers in baseball by winning a national championship before being selected as the No. 1 overall pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2023 MLB Draft. The following season, Skenes made his MLB debut and became the first player in MLB history to start the All-Star Game just one year after being drafted. He capped off an incredible 2024 season by earning National League Rookie of the Year honors and being named to the All-MLB First Team. His story and skillset align perfectly with Road to the Show, where you can chart your own path to greatness.</li><li><strong>Elly De La Cruz</strong> – Elly De La Cruz’s meteoric rise from the minors to the majors perfectly captures the excitement of working up to a big league debut and becoming a star. Since making his Major League debut in 2023 with the Cincinnati Reds, Elly has consistently proven to be one of the most electrifying players on the field. He became one of the youngest players in MLB history to hit for the cycle and is renowned for his blazing speed on the bases and his cannon-like arm, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most promising talents. The 2024 All-Star showcases an impressive five-tool skillset and a dynamic switch-hitting approach—exactly what <em>MLB The Show</em> fans dream of when developing or acquiring their starting shortstop in Franchise mode.</li><li><strong>Gunnar Henderson</strong> – Rounding out this triple play of talent is the 2023 American League Rookie of the Year, Gunnar Henderson. Selected 42nd overall in the 2019 MLB Draft, Gunnar quickly ascended through the Orioles’ farm system, making his MLB debut late in the 2022 season. Heading into 2023, he was named the #1 prospect on MLB’s Top 100 list. In his first full season in the majors, Gunnar became a cornerstone of the Orioles’ young core, helping lead the team to its first postseason appearance in seven years. His outstanding performance earned him AL Rookie of the Year honors and a Silver Slugger Award. Gunnar’s star continued to rise in 2024, as he was selected to start in the MLB All-Star Game and compete in the Home Run Derby. His MLB journey resonates deeply with <em>MLB The Show</em> fans who strive to dominate head-to-head competition in their pursuit of greatness on the diamond.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And here is a short description of the game:</p><!-- AD: content -->
