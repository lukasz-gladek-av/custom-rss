This disaster halts the flow of rune energy, causing the gods of nature to vanish and leaving the land in ruin. Players awaken as an Earth Dancer, chosen to fight against the Blight and restore balance and hope to the forsaken world.</p><h2><span>Bold New Abilities and Weapons</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_003.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Combat in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> has significantly evolved. As an Earth Dancer, players draw on spiritual energy through movement and sacred relics. The Earth Dancer class introduces a rhythmic, almost ritualistic fighting style that incorporates elemental dances to cleanse the land of Blight.</p><p>An expanded arsenal further diversifies combat—new weapon types such as the Bow make for precise ranged attacks, while the Talisman offers magical faire. Each weapon synergizes with Earth Dancer abilities, encouraging players to adapt their approach depending on the enemy’s Blight-inflicted form.</p><h2><span>It Takes a Village</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Farming returns in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, but it is no longer limited to just your own plot of land. For the first time in series history, players can take part in large-scale village restoration. After the Blight devastated entire settlements, it is your job to rebuild them from the ground up.</p><p>Through resource gathering, <a title="Genres > Crafting [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, and strategic building placement, you will attract new residents and vendors—each with their own backstories, quests, and roles in Azuma’s recovery. And reconstructing infrastructure is not just cosmetic—it also unlocks new gameplay mechanics, items, and events.</p><h2><span>Your Fantasy Japanese Life</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese culture, <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> presents a beautifully crafted world steeped in seasonal charm. From snowy mountain shrines to blooming sakura villages, each location is tied to a distinct season and visual style.</p><p>Festivals and events integrate local traditions, minigames, and relationship-building opportunities, and serve as a means to deepen bonds, trade rare items, and uncover storylines.</p><h2><span>Classic Romance and Relationships</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>True to the heart of <em>Rune Factory</em>, relationships remain a central feature. Players can choose between male and female protagonists, each fully voiced, and pursue romantic relationships with a range of eligible bachelors or bachelorettes—regardless of their protagonist’s gender.</p><p>Every romance candidate offers unique dialogue, including fully voiced romantic scenarios, as well as their own backstory and personal quests, all of which unfold as bonds deepen. Once close enough, these characters can also even you in battle.</p><h2><span>Now Available</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_007_EU.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> will be available for Switch 2, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.
