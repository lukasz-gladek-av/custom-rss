You can take to the clouds on your own or team up with friends, and every decision opens a new story. That spirit of discovery is what drives us.”</p><p>The Early Access version of the game features its core systems and mechanics, allowing players to explore one large region of the world, made up of procedurally generated islands. Within this area, players can progress through <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> and combat to unlock Tier 2 weapons, tools, and airship components, culminating in a boss encounter. Over the course of Early Access, which will last between 12 and 16 months, the game will be expanded with additional biomes, recipes, higher-tier airship components, additional narrative content, and more leading up to the full release.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Loric Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Have you ever wanted to live on an airship?

Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/yeah-us-games">Yeah Us! Games</a> announced. <span id="more-1004741"></span></p><p>“As a long term fan of both BMX and video games, I’m thrilled to be able to bring them both together in <em>Streetdog BMX</em>,” said Yeah Us! Games’ Adam Hunt in a press release. “I can’t wait to get the game out into the world and see other fans enjoy it as much as I do!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Yeah Us! Games:</p><blockquote><p>Spin, flip, grind and shred through six jam-packed maps where the streets become a biker’s playground. Players can master their latest combo in the skate park and then show off their skills off buildings, rooftops, construction zones and more. Each location offers more than just tarmac for tires – discovering the full breadth of these maps can lead players to new challenges, tricks and hidden areas, all while perfecting their craft at the same time.</p><p>Nailing that perfect combo may be “tricky” enough for some, but for the more adventurous there are over 270 challenges that will see players push their creativity to the limit. Race against the clock, master an ambitious stunt, break records and reach new heights to grind through each challenge. If players can best the bike and beat all 270, there’s no need to hit the brakes—<em>Streetdog BMX</em> dares players to keep biking and experimenting, hitting even higher scores and inventing creative new combos. </p><p>Created by BMX riders, for BMX riders, <em>Streetdog BMX</em> recognises that every player is unique. From how they play, down to how they look, this action-packed title ensures a truly custom experience as individual as the people behind the handlebars. Players can customise their bike to match their style, and choose from a range of outfits, hairstyles, tattoos and accessories before showing off on the streets.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
