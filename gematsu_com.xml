A select series of battles against other henchmen, minions, and Gods that make up the Olympus of the Kingdom of Midaldus await you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But don’t worry, don’t tremble. You won’t be alone. You’ll have Morkull (or rather, he’ll have you), who has a wide range of combos, skills, and charms that you can unlock, equip, and build to your liking before each battle.</p><p>Although you’ll also die a good handful of times.</p><p>Morkull is back!</p><p>This means that his charisma, character, and personality, along with his breaking of the fourth wall, will create a lighthearted atmosphere at all times (you’re going to need it), loaded with bad jokes, references, and memes that are very present in pop culture.</p><p>It’s like having a friend playing alongside you.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Morkull Ascend to the Gods</em> is completely hand-drawn and animated, with great care and frame by frame. In this way, thanks to traditional animation, the characters’ movements are very natural and full of life.</p><p>Distinguished by a stylized character and a wide color palette, this time, outside of Ragast, you will be able to see and discover other environments that belong to the Kingdom of Midaldus.</p><p>Morkull is back! So get back in trouble with him and join his ranks by supporting his Machiavellian cause.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Morkull: Ascend to the Gods | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0gRYjXRwkdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/morkull-ascend-to-the-gods-launches-april-2]]></content:encoded>
