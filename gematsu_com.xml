            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Enter the Gloom</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>It’s finally time to discover what lies behind the Gloom shroud enveloping these planets we call Hive Worlds. Prepare your squad to disappear into the fog and discover new dangers, from towering structures built by Terminids to what <a title="Genres > Horror [697 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s lurk beneath the planet surfaces.</p><p><strong>■ Into the Heart of Darkness</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Deep underground lies a labyrinth of cave tunnels that twist and turn, infested with the Hive Lung that seems to be the force that produces the thickening fog that makes up the Gloom.</p><p>Because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support. It’ll be your team alone against the horror.</p><p><strong>■ Terrors Above and Below</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>What little intelligence we have on the Gloom contains information about a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers that, when they detect a threat, will burrow underground and begin moving toward prey. Once close enough, they erupt from the ground and attack.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. The Gloom has mutated the Terminids even further, into grotesque monsters like the Dragonroach: a menace in the sky that dives unsuspecting Helldivers and rains down burning bile.</p><p>Our reports indicate that there are even greater, more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds, Helldiver. You must find them and take them out.</p><p><strong>■ Taking Back Hive Worlds</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Helldivers will also face brand new challenges while liberating Hive Worlds, like escorting a mobile oil rig. Helldivers must defend the rig from attacks while it traverses the treacherous Hive World terrain to the next drill site, where it will extract oil.</p><p>Meanwhile in the underground, you’ll be forced to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in an effort to stem the spread of the Gloom. There are also new optional and sub-objectives available, too.</p><p>It’s going to take all your determination and teamwork to stop the infestation from spreading any further and liberate the Hive Worlds. Get ready to dive Into the Unjust1 on September 2, Helldivers.</p><p><strong>■ Introducing the Dust Devils Premium Warbond</strong></p><p>We’re not sending you to a Hive World without the best gear we have to offer, Helldiver. The Ministry of Defense has fast-tracked the deployment of the Dust Devils Warbond, which will ensure <a title="Genres > Survival [451 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.</p><p><strong>Weapons and Stratagems</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Dust Devils comes with a hefty offering of one primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems that will aid in clearing the air—and all the bugs—on Hive Worlds.</p><ul><li><strong>AR-2 Coyote</strong> – You can hunt in packs or go by your lonesome with this assault rifle that features incendiary ammunition. But be warned: this coyote is wild.</li><li><strong>G-7 Pineapple</strong> – This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</li><li><strong>S-11 Speargun</strong> – A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA</a>T-700 Expendable Napalm</strong> – Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</li><li><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo</strong> – The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</li></ul><p><strong>Armors, <a title="Games > Capes [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/capes">Capes</a>, and More</strong></p><p>Whether you’re crouched behind craggy boulders, waiting for your moment to spring a trap on unsuspecting Terminids or marching in formation with your squad to intimidate them, they’ll look the part. Both feature the Desert Stormer passive, which grants resistance to fire, gas, acid, and arc, as well as providing a throw range increase to the bearer.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>You’ll also receive capes, player cards, an emote and player title, and a new pattern for your vehicles and Hellpods.</p><ul><li><strong><a title="Platforms > DS [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/ds">DS</a>-42 Federation’s Blade</strong> – Captures the essence of armies marching through the desert sands. Wear with the Rightful occupier cape and player card for a polished look.</li><li><strong>DS-191 Scorpion</strong> – Look like a true nomadic warrior in this desert-proof draped set, pairs perfectly with the <a title="Games > Windswept" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/windswept">Windswept</a> <a title="Games > Wayfinder [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/wayfinder">Wayfinder</a> cape and player card.<ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> Burier of Heads</li><li><strong>Emote:</strong> Raider’s Cheer</li><li><strong>Pattern:</strong> “Rattlesnake” for vehicles and Hellpods</li></ul></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Helldivers-2-Update_08-26-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p><br>Arm your fighters against the perils that await them on Hive Worlds and beyond!
