        <p>Here is an overview of the game, via IO Interactive:</p><blockquote><p><em>MindsEye</em> follows Jacob Diaz, equipped with a mysterious neural implant, the <em>MindsEye</em>, that has left him with disjointed flashbacks of his time in the service. As Jacob fights to uncover the truth, he is drawn into a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power impact every step of his journey.</p><p>Set in Redrock, a fictional desert metropolis in the not-too-distant future, <em>MindsEye</em> tells a story of artificial intelligence, human greed, and the battle for control, bringing Earth to the precipice of collapse. Players will explore a richly detailed world, uncovering hidden conspiracies while navigating a deeply personal and high-stakes narrative.</p><p><em>MindsEye</em> delivers intense combat where every decision determines <a title="Genres > Survival [398 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>. Players will engage in <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">third-person shooter</a> encounters, facing enemies that coordinate attacks, flush them from cover, and swarm with overwhelming force. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> depends on quick thinking, tactical positioning, and using the environment and a companion drone to gain the upper hand. </p><p>Whether on foot, behind the wheel, or in the air, <em>MindsEye</em> keeps players on edge in a world which is constantly under threat.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

We get a glimpse of its immersive influence—consumer robots carry out most manual tasks and an algorithm connects all-seeing devices.  The city itself is a living experiment in the existential potential of man and machine. </p><p>We meet intriguing characters, including Marco Silva, the eccentric tech genius and founder of Silva Industries, who wants to change the course of human evolution.  We’re also introduced to Shiva Vega, Redrock’s power-hungry Mayor, whose blind ambition is to make Redrock the safest city in the world and to gain even greater control of its citizens. </p><p>The volatile relationship between Silva and Vega—Big Tech and Government—is poised to impact the future of Redrock and its inhabitants, but mostly Jacob Diaz, MindsEye’s protagonist, as he searches for answers about his troubled past.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
