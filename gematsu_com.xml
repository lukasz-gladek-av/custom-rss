Outmatched and hunted in a hostile world, players will need to stay vigilant, loot their surroundings, and pick their battles carefully against formidable foes, many of which hunt you by sound.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Classic Craft-Based <a title="Genres > Survival [437 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Horror</strong> – Scavenge every corner of Rutherford Ranch to stay alive.

Explore a world teeming with danger as you gather vital resources, craft essential gear, upgrade your campsite, and rebuild outposts to have somewhere to hide.</li><li><strong>Day Prepares You. Night Hunts You</strong> – A dynamic day-night cycle that changes the world. Use daylight wisely to explore, scavenge supplies, craft what you need, and prepare for what’s coming. When night falls, the real nightmares come out to play. More enemies appear, stronger and more aggressive than before. The landscape becomes harder to navigate with just your flashlight. Sometimes your best hope is to find shelter and hunker down till morning.</li><li><strong>Deadly <a title="Companies > Sile" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sile">Sile</a>nce Goes A Long Way</strong> – <a title="Genres > Stealth [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> and combat go hand-in-hand here as many of the twisted creatures in Rutherford Ranch hunt and stalk you by sound alone. Brute force will often just land you in an early grave. Use sound to your advantage, luring creatures away from your path or cleverly leading them straight into deadly traps you laid.</li><li><strong>80s Vibes Meets Comic Book Flair</strong> – Inspired by the award-nominated comic book series, <em>I Hate This Place</em> comes to life with bold colors, a punchy retro comic book style, and a heavy dose of ’80s flair.
