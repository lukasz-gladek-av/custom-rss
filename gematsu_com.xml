What a ride it’s been.</p><p>With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, <em>Rock Band 4</em> will be removed from the PlayStation and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes—you’ll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to downloadable content: songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you’ve purchased will remain in your library.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We’re so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it’s been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep downloadable content library and a best in class band sim. If you’ve been meaning to grab a few last songs, now’s the time. Thanks again,</p><p>—The <em>Rock Band</em> Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/rock-band-4-to-be-delisted-on-october-5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>“There is a saying that when you depart from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome you.”</p><p>Bong-gu the Welsh Corgi was once an abandoned dog. Judging by his docked tail, someone had once cared for him, but for some reason, he became unwanted. As an eight-year-old senior dog with various illnesses, it was hard for him to find a new family. Trapped in a cage at an animal shelter, each day passed gloomily for Bong-gu.</p><p>Then one day, a miracle happened. Bong-gu met a new family. The man who took Bong-gu had a somewhat scruffy appearance and seemed slightly awkward, but Bong-gu loved his scent. From that day on, Bong-gu lived out his remaining days just like any other dog would: playing tug-of-war, running around, eating, and sleeping. In the end, he crossed the rainbow bridge, having lived out a simple yet joyful life.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Sniff sniff… this scent… One day in dog heaven, Bong-gu wakes from his nap to a very familiar scent. Sniff sniff… it’s dad! Though faint, surely it is dad’s scent he has been waiting for. Jubilant, Bong-gu escapes dog heaven and embarks on a journey to meet his dad—a journey that may hold unexpected dangers. Just as his dad once found him by some miracle, it is now Bong-gu’s turn to find his dad.</p><p>Will Bong-gu be able to see his dad again?</p><p><strong>An Adventure in a Beautiful World Filled With Stories of Dogs and People</strong></p><p>Teetering on the border between life and death, a world outside of dog heaven feels both familiar and strange. Embark on an adventure through beautifully crafted landscapes including deserts, snowy mountains, and beaches. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> diverse gameplay across adventure, action, <a title="Genres > Racing [284 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> genres. And remember, Bong-gu is a dog! <a title="Genres > Action [3,101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s like sniffing, barking, running, and jumping come with limitations. To overcome his limitations and reunite with his dad, he must meet, give, and receive help from people and other dogs, each with unique stories to share. Unlike cats, there is only so much a dog can do alone!</p><p><strong>In the End, This is a Story for All of Us</strong></p><p>At the end of his journey, Bong-gu finally reunites with his dad. The journey is filled with joy and excitement, but also moments of hardship and sadness. Yet, the ending has always been written: those destined to meet again will find their way back together. <em>My Little Puppy</em> may be a story about a dog, but it is also a story of relationships, farewells, and reunions that speaks to us all. For those waiting to see their once-in-a-lifetime friend or family member again, or those preparing for an inevitable parting that may come, we hope this story brings warm comfort. One day, we will meet again.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/my-little-puppy-launches-in-november-for-pc-in-first-half-of-2026-for-ps5-and-switch]]></content:encoded>
