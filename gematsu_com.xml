    <p><span>A deeper look at IO Interactive's original take on the origin of James Bond.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released the story trailer and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em>. <span id="more-1026404"></span></p><p>“With <em>007 First Light</em>, we set out to reimagine the origin of James Bond, exploring the formative moments that shape him into the agent players know, but not yet the legend he will become,” said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak in a press release. “This is a version of Bond who is still inexperienced and finding his footing in the world of espionage, yet already defined by the instincts, intelligence, and resolve that set him apart. Players will recognize the unmistakable qualities that make him Bond from the very beginning.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Revealed during today’s Sony PlayStation State of Play, the story trailer sets the stage for a global intrigue, as Bond is recruited into MI6 and enters the world of espionage, full of hidden agendas and unseen threats. The trailer offers early glimpses of Bond’s exploits in Iceland, showcasing his decisive judgment, nerve, and resourcefulness that draw the attention of MI6, propelling him into the grueling training of the newly revived 00 programme. Still inexperienced and sometimes reckless, Bond (portrayed by Patrick Gibson) will have to confront his instincts with the structure and discipline of his new world, where initiative is not always rewarded, and obedience is often the expectation.</p><p>As he enters the world of espionage, Bond discovers an unexpected advocate in M (portrayed by Priyanga Burford), who recognizes his potential as an agent able to take control of desperate situations and complete his objectives, following his own judgment. John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a former 00 agent and the programme’s training instructor, stands in contrast to Bond. A disciplined, by-the-book operative, Greenway’s strict philosophy quickly clashes with Bond’s instinctive and improvisational approach in the field. </p><p>Despite their differences, Bond and Greenway are forced to work together as the resurgence of 009, a former British operative now turned rogue, becomes the newly revived 00 programme’s first true test in the field. From the quiet Carpathian Mountains to the dangerous black market of Aleph, Bond’s pursuit takes him across the globe, leading him to the unpredictable Bawma (portrayed by Lenny Kravitz) and more. Bond will also have to contend with mysterious characters, such as Charlotte Roth (portrayed by Noemie Nakai), and determine where their loyalties lie before choosing who to trust.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

    <p><span>A video game adaptation of The Bird That Drinks Tears.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > KRAFTON [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton">KRAFTON</a> and developer <a title="Companies > KRAFTON Montreal Studio" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton/krafton-montreal-studio">KRAFTON Montreal Studio</a> have officially announced <em><a title="Games > Project Windless" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/project-windless">Project Windless</a></em>, a single-player open-world <a title="Genres > Action [3,395 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [18,037 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>  adaptation of the Korean fantasy novel series <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em> that <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-INC-BEGINS-DEVELOPMENT-ON-A-NEW-GAME-BASED-ON-THE-BIRD-THAT-DR">first began development</a> in 2022. It will launch for consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, including <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,420 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1025968"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via KRAFTON:</p><blockquote><p><strong>A New Premium <a title="Genres > Open-World [829 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,975 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></strong></p><p>Designed as a player-driven open-world experience, <em>Project Windless</em> centers on a continent-spanning conflict, combining epic storytelling with visceral, mastery-driven combat and massive real-time battles. Built with Unreal Engine 5, the game features a non-linear structure where player decisions shape alliances and the broader conflict unfolding across the world through exploration, combat, and interaction with key factions.</p><p><strong>Set in the World of <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em></strong></p><p>While <em>Project Windless</em> is designed to stand on its own for new players, its world is rooted in <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em>, a landmark Korean fantasy series by author Lee Yeong-do. Instead of directly adapting the novels, the game is set approximately 1,500 years before the original story, during a largely unexplored mythical age when legends were still being formed. This approach allows <em>Project Windless</em> to serve as an entry point for global audiences while also expanding the universe for longtime fans. The world features four intelligent races: Humans, Rekon, Nhaga, and Tokkebi. Each race has its own culture, conflicts, and worldview.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1026262"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play as the Hero King</strong></p><p>In <em>Project Windless</em>, players assume the role of the Hero King, a legendary mighty warrior of the Rekon race. Rekons are towering humanoid bird beings known for their overwhelming strength and ferocity. Armed with twin star-forged blades, the Hero King stands as a powerful force facing overwhelming odds—cutting through dozens of foes simultaneously, confronting massive creatures, and leading allied forces when battles escalate to epic scale. As players build reputation and forge relationships across the world, they unite different races and factions, shaping the foundations of a future kingdom through their actions.</p><p><strong>Large-Scale Battles Powered by <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>s Technology</strong></p><p>At the core of <em>Project Windless</em> is Mass Technology. This technology enables thousands of soldiers and massive creatures to clash in real time across dynamic battlefields.</p><p>Combat is fully real-time, fast-paced, and skill-based. Players fight directly within massive engagements rather than issuing commands from a distance, combining precise combat mastery with tactical decision-making to influence the flow of battle. The result is a one-versus-many combat experience that blends personal action with the scale of full-scale warfare.</p><p>“From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world,” said KRAFTON Montreal Studio head and creative director Patrik Methe. “For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. <em>Project Windless</em> is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.”</p><p><strong>A Global Development Effort</strong></p><p>Development of <em>Project Windless</em> is led by KRAFTON Montreal Studio, KRAFTON’s AAA development hub in North America, in close collaboration with teams in Pangyo, South Korea. This partnership combines Western AAA development expertise with a strong focus on cultural authenticity and worldbuilding inspired by Korean mythology.</p><p><strong>First Developer Diary Now Available</strong></p><p>Alongside the reveal trailer, KRAFTON also released the first developer diary for <em>Project Windless</em>. The video offers early insight into the game’s creative vision, world design, and development philosophy, and is available now on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectWindless" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Project Windless</em> YouTube channel</a>.</p><p><em>Project Windless</em> is designed as a premium, single-player experience with no multiplayer or live-service components. The game is currently in development for PC and consoles. Additional details, including the release window, will be announced at a later date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
