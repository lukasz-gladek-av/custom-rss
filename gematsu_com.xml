A release date was not announced. <span id="more-964121"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Almost five hundred years of history unfold before you in <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, the latest version of one of the greatest <a title="Genres > Strategy [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> of all time. Guide the destiny of any of hundreds of nations and societies in a simulated living world of unparalleled depth and complexity.</p><p><em>Europa Universalis V</em> builds on the franchise’s core concept of developing and advancing nations from around a deeply researched historical world, adding more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revised military system and greater logistical depth that will challenge even the most experienced strategy gamers.</p><p><strong>Watch History Unfold Before You</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Rule a land of your choosing. Hundreds of nations are yours to command, as you guide the destiny of millions of people through the late Middle Ages up to the Age of Revolution—from the mighty Yuan Dynasty to the city-states of Italy, from the warring clans of feudal Japan to the Pope himself.</li><li>Decide which course your nation will take. Historical events and situations await as you chart a unique path through a new history written by your decisions. <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> The Hundred Years’ War, the Protestant Reformation, the collapse of old dynasties and rise of new ones.</li><li>Explore alternate histories as you shape the world to meet your ambitions. What if England succeeded in pressing its continental claims? What if China pursued an overseas empire? What if Mongol supremacy in Russia persisted? Every <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> opens the possibility for an original history.</li></ul><p><strong>Prove Your Mettle as a Ruler</strong></p><ul><li>Impose domestic peace in a divided realm. Keep your nation’s factions in line as Estates jockey for power in your nation. Offer privileges to one group of citizens while you limit the power of another, all in the service of keeping your population under control.</li><li>Negotiate your way through an uneasy peace. Use diplomacy to entrench your dynasty across realms or build an invincible alliance. But remember that nations have no permanent friends—only permanent interests; so use your ambassadors carefully. Exact favors from friends, send threats to enemies, and keep an eye on everyone in-between.</li><li>Conquer new lands to expand your borders. Wage War on those who impede your ambition in a completely new <em><a title="Games > Europa [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/europa">Europa</a> Universalis</em> military system. Start in the age of levies and mercenaries and, through social development, evolve to vast standing armies and impenetrable fortresses. Choose skilled commanders to oversee both land and naval forces.</li></ul><p><strong>Develop Your Society</strong></p><ul><li>Build a strong economic infrastructure in the most detailed trade system yet seen in a <em>Europa Universalis</em> game. Dozens of goods and crops are available for production and trade on a map filled with new riches to discover. Invest in feeding a growing population or trade your surplus to less bountiful societies.</li><li>Mold your society to meet the historical moment. Choose your societal values, with new options opening as the ages move on. Centralize power at court or share it with your nobles. Pursue a tolerant policy for all faiths or condemn heretics. Emphasize massed armies or an elite cadre of quality soldiers.</li><li>Govern a nation composed of many cultures and faiths in a detailed <a title="Genres > Simulation [737 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of the past. For the first time in <em>Europa Universalis</em>, populations are represented on the map in detail, so provinces may be divided by religion or culture. Your decisions will determine how these populations will fare under your leadership.</li></ul><p><strong>Be Ambitious</strong></p><ul><li>Prevail in the greatest strategic challenges of the past. Test your expertise in grand strategic planning on a worldscape larger and more detailed than seen in any previous Paradox Interactive game. Challenge yourself to outdo the most famous rulers of the past, eclipsing their grand accomplishments and building your own vision of a richly detailed globe.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and presentation below.

        </li></ul><p>“As a team that truly loves <em>Alien</em>, we’re incredibly proud of the immersive original story we’ve told with <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>,” said Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson in a press release. “Following our great start on [virtual reality] platforms, we’re excited to bring the Evolved Edition to PC and [PlayStation 5] later this year so that fans of Alien can experience Zula’s journey wherever they prefer to play.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Survios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the universe of the <em>Alien</em> films like never before: re-envisioned for console and PC. An all-new <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-horror entry into the classic franchise, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> transforms you into Zula Hendricks—the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani’s blacksite experiments—on a dangerous mission to investigate an SOS from the backwater planet Purdan, home to a long-defunct mining colony. With her ever-present synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled <a title="Genres > Stealth [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and serious firepower at her disposal. With deeply personal stakes propelling both Zula and Davis deeper, they must plunge to the dark heart of Purdan to expose—but not unleash—the horrors lurking within.</p><p><strong>Part One of a Two-Part Story</strong></p><p>Zula’s Fight Begins Here: Part One of this gripping two-part story thrusts you into the violent world of <em>Alien</em>, where you will uncover the secrets lurking within the GES facility on LV-354, the enigmatic planet Purdan. This installment stands alone as a complete story yet leaves you hanging on a thrilling cliffhanger, eager to dive deeper into Zula’s unfolding story in Part Two, where she will face new challenges and deadlier enemies.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Evolved <em>Alien</em> Combat</strong> – Battle Xenomorphs who behave just like their cinematic counterparts: actively hunting you throughout locations, climbing and crawling on walls and ceilings, stealthing through ducts and tunnels, and jumping on objects within the world.</li><li><strong>Explore to Survive</strong> – With the facility destroyed, resources like ammunition and health supplies are limited, so you’ll have to scrounge and scavenge to stay stocked. That means searching every possible room, closet, and corner, where more than just supplies are hiding.</li><li><strong>Authentic <em>Alien</em> Atmosphere</strong> – Drop directly into the world of the <em>Alien</em> films as you become ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks on a deadly mission featuring characters, environments, weapons, enemies, and stakes from the classic franchise, all within a gripping new story that sets you at the center of the action.</li><li><strong>Spatial Sound Design</strong> – With Xenomorphs lurking everywhere, you’ll most likely hear them before you see them. Stay frosty; that hissing sound could be a Xenomorph or a burst pipe. Spatial sound alerts you where they’re stalking, but your <a title="Genres > Survival [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is up to you.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
