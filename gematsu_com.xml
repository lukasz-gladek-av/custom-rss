It’s no secret that <em>Palworld</em> has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release <em>Palworld</em> next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game.”</p><p>Bucky continued, “So, what does this mean? It means that things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year. It also means our winter update won’t be as big as [the] February [update] was. We hope our players understand that we’re taking this extra time to improve the game overall. Now, that said, it doesn’t mean there will be no updates, but we still do have a few surprises planned for our winter update this year.</p><p>“We just want to be transparent about where we’re headed and the development of <em>Palworld</em> going forward. Development of <em>Palworld</em> is not slowing down or scaling back, quite the opposite. <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 will be a major milestone for us, and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update. Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end. We’re really excited about this, and we hope our fans will be really excited about this too. We plan to share some sneak peeks about <em>Palworld</em> 1.0 in the very near future.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
