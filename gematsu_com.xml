We can’t wait to show more of <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s intense tactical combat and epic warfare in the months to come, leading up to its release on October 10.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Electronic Arts:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The ultimate all-out warfare experience.

After a high-profile assassination shocks the world, major European countries have left NATO, while the US and its allies grapple with the fallout. A massive private military corporation unafraid to cross lines, with deep pockets and the latest tech, looks to fill the power vacuum. This army is PAX ARMATA. What’s left of NATO is in tatters, wounded and battered. This is the world of <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> introduces a host of new features, including the all-new Kinesthetic Combat System, which brings enhancements to movement and gunplay. This gives players an unprecedented level of mobility, offering new tactical options such as Drag and Revive to pull teammates out of danger and back from the brink, and mounting weapons on walls to reduce recoil. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> will launch with a robust package of multiplayer modes and maps, taking the fight around the world from Egypt, to Gibraltar and the streets of New York. Each map features multiple combat zones, hand-crafted and tailored to suit specific modes, ensuring each fight is designed to compliment the player experience and provide a variety of play options.
