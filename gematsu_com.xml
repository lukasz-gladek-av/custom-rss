It’s a new sensation roguelite where you can enjoy different daily adventures each time with an incredibly free and cute dragon daughter.

Her personality changes depending on your “discipline”, and her battle style evolves dramatically as well. Through various ingredients and experiences, you’ll strengthen your dragon daughter’s stats with your unique strategy. The joy of trial and error as you aim for the strongest dragon is unparalleled. There’s even a “debt” system, so you might find yourself raising her while desperately managing money!</li><li><strong>Multiple Endings Through Free-Form Gameplay</strong> – This free-form game allows you to raise completely different dragon daughters based on your choices. Depending on your nurturing approach, various endings will appear. For those who want to delve deeper, why not play again and again to discover all the endings?
