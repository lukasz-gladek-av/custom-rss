      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Valve [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> has provided <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam_hardware/announcements/detail/625565405086220584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update</a> on its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/valve-announces-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller">November 2025-announced</a> Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller hardware—specifically addressing launch timing and pricing. <span id="more-1023815"></span></p><p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” the update reads. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p><p>It continues, “Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible.”</p><p>In the meantime, Valve plans to share deep dives into specific features, updates, and “what’s new” writeups via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Hardware blog</a>. Today’s update comes in the form of a FAQ addressing some of the other most-asked-about topics surrounding the new hardware.</p><p>Here is the full FAQ:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Steam Frame and VR</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Will Steam Frame support other streaming services?</strong></p><p>SteamOS has a built-in browser, and we expect streaming services to work in a theatrical browser mode.</p><p><strong>How can I request a Steam Frame developer kit?</strong></p><p>Steamworks developers can submit a request for Steam Frame dev kits at the partner site <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Supplies are limited, but we are sending out kits on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Will Steam Frame work with lighthouse base stations?</strong></p><p>It’s not something we’re working on, but we built Steam Frame to be modular and extensible so that the community and 3rd parties can build out the features and accessories that are important to them.</p><p><strong>Can Steam Frame be used while wearing glasses?</strong></p><p>A bunch of people on the team wear glasses and use Steam Frame without issue, but it really depends on the width of the glasses frames. And while we don’t have details to share yet, we are looking into making prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</p><p>I heard that Steam Frame has foveated streaming – is that the same thing as foveated rendering? What games support it?<br>With Steam Frame, we are introducing a new feature called foveated streaming. While both use eye tracking data, the technology is different:</p><ul><li>Foveated rendering uses eye tracking data so the game only renders high resolution data in the portion of the viewport that the player is looking at.</li><li>Foveated streaming, on the other hand, uses eye tracking data so that the <a title="Platforms > PC [25,407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> only streams high resolution data in the portion of the viewport the player is looking at.</li></ul><p>Since foveated streaming is a system-level feature, it applies to all games, and requires no game developer work. If a game implements foveated rendering, the benefits of that feature will stack with foveated streaming.</p><p><strong>Will Valve Index have ongoing product support?</strong></p><p>While we’re no longer making Valve Index, we do intend to support Index owners the same way we have in the past on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Machine</strong></p><p><strong>How well can Steam Machine play newer, more demanding games on Steam?</strong></p><p>In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K resolution / 60 frames per second with FSR on Steam Machine. That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.</p><p>In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.</p><p><strong>Will third parties be able to make faceplates for Steam Machine? Will you be making the CAD for those faceplates available?</strong></p><p>Yes, we plan to share faceplate CAD, specs, and details in the coming months, for customers and manufacturers to make their own.</p><p><strong>What components of Steam Machine are upgradeable?</strong></p><p>Steam Machine’s SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both accessible and upgradeable.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Controller</strong></p><p><strong>Can I play non steam games with the Steam Controller?</strong></p><p>he controller can work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller-update-we-have-work-to-do-to-land-on-concrete-pricing-and-launch-dates]]></content:encoded>

It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p><p>Do anything and everything. <em>Caves of Qud</em> is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [18,002 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Rlease Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Release Date Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DisUBYdcFcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/caves-of-qud-for-switch-launches-february-16]]></content:encoded>
