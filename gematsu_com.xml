We asked ourselves: Where do we go from <em>Descenders</em>? How do we deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed, but expand beyond mountain biking? From there, the idea of perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports was born.</p><p>With <em>Descenders Next</em>, players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding <a title="Genres > Action [2,880 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport feels and handles differently, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of Next.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Descenders Next</em> already features as much content as the original <em>Descenders</em>, with full online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [555 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore. Players will earn rep as they scale the mountain, and use that to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles and more to customize their rider.</p><p>Last time around, <em>Descenders</em> provided both procedurally-generated tracks, as well as a selection of hand-crafted parks. With <em>Descenders Next</em> we’ve brought it all together with a more natural experience, as players will tackle procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas.</p><p>The parks in particular provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next’s playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you’ll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you’ll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest.</p><p>Top it all off with an absolutely banging soundtrack from Monstercat, and you’ve got even more reasons to spend hours on the slopes, chilling out to the latest in drum and bass hits.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Descenders Next is OUT NOW!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fE11hzKkErQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/descenders-next-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc-now-available]]></content:encoded>
