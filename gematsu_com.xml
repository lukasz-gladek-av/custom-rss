        <blockquote><ul><li><strong>Story</strong> – It’s the year 20XX. Neo Tokyo is under the iron rule of a mysterious masked man known as Zero, who has declared that all affairs be settled through his invention, “Extreme Games” (XG). As these merciless rules turn citizens’ lives into mere playthings, a group of young rebels forms a resistance. Armed with techniques and gear inspired by their beloved “XB (Extreme Baseball),” they join forces to reclaim their stolen dreams and restore freedom to Neo Tokyo.</li><li><strong>Battle</strong> – In <em>TRIBE NINE</em>, you’ll engage in dynamic three-person team battles. Each playable character boasts unique skills and <a title="Genres > Action [2,471 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, offering a range of playstyles. Additionally, your team members will intelligently adapt to each situation and support you in battle. They can draw enemy aggression, heal your wounds, and coordinate powerful attacks with your controlled character to turn the tide of combat.</li><li><strong>XB (Extreme Baseball)</strong> – In <em>TRIBE NINE</em>, “XB (Extreme Baseball)” is one of the game’s biggest features and is a special battle mode that is very different from regular battles. “XB” is the characters’ beloved dueling method, featured in high-impact 3D cutscenes.</li><li><strong>Exploration</strong> – Progress through <em>TRIBE NINE</em>‘s story by navigating the 2D pixel-style overworld of Neo Tokyo. Beyond battles, you’ll uncover treasures, tackle mini-games, and fulfill requests from locals in each area.
