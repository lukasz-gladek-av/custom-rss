With razor-sharp responsiveness and explosive visual flair, the game delivers a combat experience as intense as it is expressive.</p><p>At launch, the Early Access version will feature six stages and six boss battles. These levels are packed with enemy variety, unique terrains, and escalating challenges that reward aggressive experimentation and replayability. </p><p>Players can test their skills across four carefully balanced difficulty modes, making the game accessible to newcomers while offering a fierce challenge to <a title="Genres > Action [2,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> veterans.
