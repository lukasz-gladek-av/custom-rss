Here is a look at some of the unique classes that appear in the game:</p><p><strong>Striker</strong></p><p>Frontline fighters with high physical defense that use spears. Possess the unique ability to increase their attack power by moving, making them a great choice for a mobile fighter. Have high physical defense, but low magical defense, so be careful!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_037.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Wizard</strong></p><p>Has a broader AOE range than the similar magic class, the Witch, so they can attack more enemies from the backlines. Just like the Witch, they have low physical defense and are not very mobile, but if you account for that, they are a class you can rely on to take care of multiple foes.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_038.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Healer</strong></p><p>Not only does this class possess healing abilities, but they also increase the defense of all allies in range, so they can fulfill their role simply by being deployed as a backline healer. Necessary for the Heal Facility, so having at least one will make your adventure easier.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_039.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Engineer</strong></p><p>A unique class that allows you to use Gadget-related abilities such as building up more Mana. Their real value is revealed when there are Gadgets on the map. Deploy them with Apricot to witness their true power!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_040.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Old Man</strong></p><p>Can use any close-range weapon well and is a powerful frontline fighter. Though he has some peculiar abilities, his high attack and defense make him very useful in battle. However, he will be Removed after only 2 turns, so he is best used when you need a burst of power.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_041.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Granny</strong></p><p>The most powerful backline humanoid magic class. Has high INT and magical defense, which affects magic casting, and high RES, which affects healing. Can also obtain abilities that increase the AOE and range of Skills. However, like the Old Man, she will be Removed after only two turns, so your timing is very important.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_042.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Sailor</strong></p><p>A peculiar mid-range unit that doesn’t have any special abilities or specialities, but instead has the most turns before being Removed. Their abilities make them the target of attacks, so they’re useful for shielding weaker allies. Train this class to get many abilities such as an ability to increase their Remove turns, get more EXP, decrease SP usage, and other unique skills. Maybe it would be worthwhile to raise one as a training exercise!?</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_043.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Goat Fighter</strong></p><p>An exceptional warrior of the Goat tribe with the ability to blow back their enemies. Their attack power increases as they move, and their other abilities increase with additional Goat tribe units on the map, making them an easy class to power up. However, they are extremely weak to magic, so be careful!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_044.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Mer Guard</strong></p><p>A Mer tribe warrior with strong defenses who can protect their allies. Can reliably protect allies with their Mer tribe characteristics of being immune to status ailments and having high magic defense. Abilities increase with other Mer tribe units on the map.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_045.png"></a></figure><p><strong>Owl Gunner</strong></p><p>An Owl tribe class that uses guns and has high JUMP power. Abilities increase with other Owl tribe units on the map. Can toy with enemies by taking potshots at them from high vantage points while avoiding damage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Phantom-Brave-The-Lost-Hero_2024_11-21-24_046.png"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
