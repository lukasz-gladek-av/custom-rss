Heartbeats are replaced by gears, reason intertwined with primal instinct. None can tell if this is right or wrong.   Here, there are no saviors—only the instinct to survive and a will that evolves unceasingly.  </p><p>Every modification is an act of defiance against fate. Every scar serves as proof of existence. Across wastelands and shattered cities, they ignite the spark of machinery—. At the edge of neon and ruin, the wild still burns.  </p><p>From the creators of <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch</em> comes Zoopunk, a new 3D action-adventure.</p><p>Play as Rayton, a veteran rabbit swordsman, and take command of a diverse team of playable animal heroes rising against the oppressive mechanical army. Fight with a wide arsenal of melee weapons, explore a stylized dieselpunk world, and uncover the long-buried secrets of a fallen kingdom.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Yet you will keep gaining new powers until you have the tools to lay waste to your enemies.
