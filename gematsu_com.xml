Gather resources, catalog new findings, and turn your knowledge into steel by building everything from bases and farms, and eventually, automated factories. However, you aren’t entirely alone in this world, as unfriendly monsters lie waiting to snuff out your existence. While Kent is a clone who cannot permanently die, try to avoid biting the dust too often, as it’s still a major inconvenience.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Explore, Scan, and Catalogue</strong> – Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with fascinating flora, fauna, and climate events. Classify every animal, plant, and mineral in order to help you survive the passing seasons.</li><li><strong>Craft it to the Limit</strong> – Use every material at your disposal to build your base. Start small by turning wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal, and slowly but surely grow your base into a full-blown resource-generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.</li><li><strong>Survive… or Not! You’ll Be Cloned Anyways</strong> – Even though Kent will be revived endlessly, that doesn’t change the fact that dying is a major drag. You’ll need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes, and polish your <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> skills. Building your own farms and vivariums is your ticket to a steady source of nourishment.</li><li><strong>Build the Home Base of Your Dreams</strong> – Expand your home base and create an automated system to allow you to streamline and optimize your productions while you are off exploring.</li><li><strong>Traverse Exotic Locales in Style</strong> – From vibrant jungles to desolate ruins, traverse post-apocalyptic Earth with your hoverboard, hang glider, grappling hook and more. It is up to you to maneuver with equal parts adventure and efficiency.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kentum - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUalylbx8PQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/kentum-launches-november-6]]></content:encoded>
