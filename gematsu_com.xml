She is so abnormal that even the fantasy land of Gensokyo considers her an anomaly. Truth is, she can visit Gensokyo in her dreams!</p><p><strong>A New Incident Has Occurred, and Gensokyo Has a Clone Problem</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler where the player, as Sumireko, has to navigate tricky mazes and capture a party of the strongest <em>Touhou</em> characters to assist them in turn-based battles. Go all over Gensokyo and beyond, to solve an incident which seems a little too convenient for Sumireko, seeing as she’s the only person in Gensokyo who has a tool to control this infestation of clones: her newly-bought smartphone.</p><p><strong>A Large Selection of Your Favorite <em>Touhou</em> Characters</strong></p><p>Clones are roaming the lands! They are known as Sleepers and take the shape of established <em>Touhou</em> characters, and as such, almost every <em>Touhou</em> character is represented and playable. Sumireko’s phone is equipped with a special app that allows her to capture Sleepers by beating them in a round of Danmaku.</p><p>If you win, you can add them to your party, or turn them into useful items! You can also fuse multiple Sleepers together to make something new entirely.</p><p>Adding Sleepers to your party will increase battery usage. If your phone runs out of battery charge, you will lose access to Sleepers and your Map, so always come prepared!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaQHw0i_Id4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/touhou-artificial-dream-in-arcadia-coming-to-ps5-ps4-and-switch-on-july-3]]></content:encoded>

Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade, and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Home to the world’s greatest minds, GATE operates a global network of secretive research laboratories, spanning every field of scientific study—and the realms beyond.</p><p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable—including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect—known as The Order—is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home—for now.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> brings a 90s science-fiction twist and rich character progression to the <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [532 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> open world survival crafting genre. Up to six players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Science Meets Violence</strong> – Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps – everything your big science brain can muster!</li><li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong> – Make yourself at home—you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.</li><li><strong>Form the Ultimate Think Tank</strong> – Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.</li><li><strong>Survive to See Your Next Day Off</strong> – Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional science-fiction <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,375 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Abiotic Factor - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAvH9T__jLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/abiotic-factor-launches-july-22]]></content:encoded>
