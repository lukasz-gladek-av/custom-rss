You are free to agree with El Presidente—on the greatness of Tropico and his unmatched leadership skills. In <em>Tropico 7</em>, you step into his shiny boots again to build your archipelago nation and—literally—move mountains.</p><p>With great power comes great responsibility – and even greater opportunity. As the most benevolent leader of your island nation, guide your loyal citizens (and your Swiss Bank Account) through the ages toward untold prosperity. Remember: Control isn’t tyranny, it’s efficiency – and more control means more efficiency (except when Penultimo is involved, but that’s another story).</p><p>Exert your control and shape the landscape you are building on to fit your vision. Plan and construct complex city layouts, fulfil the multifaceted needs of your subjects, give precise directions to your army, and look down on your opponents in the council, all while revelling in your own splendor. See how it all leads to ever greater efficiency? This could be an aspiring dictator’s dream come true indeed… however, sometimes life gives you lemons. Or obstacles in the shape of a very clever and very annoying opponent: Victoria Guerra! You will need all your skills, cunning and presidential ‘grandeur’ to end this latest chapter with a simple truth: ¡Victoria no es la revolucion!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Lead your nation to new heights: <em>Tropico 7</em> tells El Presidente’s continuous success story across five ampaign maps—starring himself, Penultimo and a new nemesis: Victoria Guerra.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>More is More</strong> – Archipelagos, with the biggest islands ever in the series, await your rule, expanded with 10 extra scenarios, more than 20 sandbox maps, and endless possibilities with a random map generator.</li><li><strong>Move Mountains—Literally</strong> – Erase them, create beaches, or even create entirely new islands! The new terraforming feature brings your megalomaniac dreams to life. Start that mammoth project – NOW!</li><li><strong>Bollocks Uhm… Politics</strong> – Navigate the snares and pits of internal politics, when you summon the different factions to your council, a new way to meet them face to face while you pulverize their dreams – or use them for a BIG DEAL to your own advantage.</li><li><strong>Make the World Your Playground</strong> – Elections, election speeches and a vast portfolio of edicts depending on your political standing spice up your daily rule while you juggle foreign affairs and occasionally steal… uhm relocate a landmark to revel in its benefits.</li><li><strong>Built to Prosper</strong> – Strategically place buildings to make use of synergy effects, keep citizen satisfaction high, and fill any unused plots of land with beautiful parks in a freely customized size.</li><li><strong>Generalissimo No. 1</strong> – Eliminate those pesky rebels and fend off foreign threats with a reworked military system enabling more direct control of your military units.</li><li><strong>Always Judge a Book by Its Cover</strong> – Customize the appearance of your palace and El Presidente with new and creative options.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tropico 7 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9ZrwBfbALU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/tropico-7-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>stones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.</p><p>Now 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,480 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!</p><p>The original <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song</em> included many of the <em>SaGa</em> series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded high-definition graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the <em>SaGa</em> series.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Brand new localization in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
