It sold 200,000 units within its first 24 hours of release, then 500,000 units by the end of October 19. As of October 21, it achieved a peak of 221,963 concurrent players, making it the 76th most played game on Steam based on all-time peak concurrent players, and fifth most played game on Steam based on current concurrent player count.﻿</p><p>“Team Soda is incredibly humbled to have reached such heights, and we owe this success to an incredible community of players and our friends at Bilibili Game,” said producer Jeff Chen in a press release. “Whether you’ve been with us through our early days promoting the demo on Steam or are just joining to see what all the quacking is about, thank you.”</p><p>Here is a brief overview of the game, via Bilibili:</p><blockquote><p><em>Escape from Duckov</em> is a funky and adorable duck-themed single-player top-down PvE indie survival RPG. Unlike hardcore tactical shooters, the game features cartoonish enemies, fog-of-war mechanics, and randomly dropped loot. Set in a mysterious egg-shaped world that’s slowly falling apart, players customize their own duck and set out to escape the planet by crafting a rocket ship. Combined with base-building, weapon customization, and in-depth progression systems, it offers high replayability that will keep players coming back for more.﻿</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/escape-from-duckov-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>
