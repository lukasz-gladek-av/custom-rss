Cold and distant, she floats above the ground, lashing out with psychic blasts and violent telekinesis. Her eyes are vacant, her voice devoid of emotion—something ancient has taken hold of her…and it’s not letting go.</p><p><strong>Super Anubis</strong></p><p>For years, whispers claimed Anubis was a fraud, a cult figure with no true power. But now, Super Anubis has emerged: levitating, glowing, and summoning dark forces beyond comprehension. The question lingers—was he a fake all along…or a prophet finally revealed?</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
