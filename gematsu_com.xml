With a sardonic cat, a talking power tool, and a twisting supernatural plot, in a unique musical mystery narrative adventure.</p><p>From spooky ska to wartime jazz to skater punk, each mysterious character you meet has their own story and song, waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>But when night falls, your talking power tools transform into weapons against the supernatural. Unleash the vacuum on vengeful spirits, expose invisible assailants with the paint sprayer, or subdue slithering spooks with a well-aimed bookcase to the face using the furniture cannon.</p><p>As players explore, renovate, and restore, they’ll uncover Lovecraftian mysteries, and with each passing day, a creeping horror tightens its grip.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
