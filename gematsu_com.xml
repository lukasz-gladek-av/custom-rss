            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/acclaim-interview-with-ceo-alex-josef-a-new-era</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acclaim-interview-with-ceo-alex-josef-%E2%80%93-a-new-era.1294128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/tag/play-acclaim-2025-09-10">today’s Play Acclaim showcase</a>, in which resurrected games publisher <a title="Companies > Acclaim [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/acclaim">Acclaim</a> revealed its premiere lineup, <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> caught up with company CEO Alex Josef, who talked about the brand’s revival and role in the modern games landscape. <span id="more-990931"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>How do you define the Acclaim of today versus the Acclaim everyone knew back in the dinosaur days?</strong></p><p><strong>Alex Josef, CEO:</strong> “The old Acclaim was loud, chaotic, and larger-than-life. That fundamental essence is still there. The difference is that today’s Acclaim channels that same energy and excitement into empowering awesome indie creators and delivering newer experiences that feel bold, surprising, and a little rebellious. It’s less about chasing the blockbusters of yesteryears and more about sparking the next wave of them.”</p><p><strong>Do you see Acclaim’s role now as preserving video games history through new ideas? Or is it more about reinventing that history for a new generation?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “I think it’s both. There’s a respect for history in the way we build our slate—some of our games are direct nods to eras and genres players grew up with. But reinvention and growth is the real goal. We’re taking those touch points and translating them into something defining for a new generation that’s discovering Acclaim for the first time. Our team is comprised of a great mix of people, many that grew up with Acclaim and want to make sure their children, friends, and family feel that same excitement they experienced when playing these new Acclaim Games.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>You’re backing creative indie developers. What qualities or traits are you looking for in teams or projects to fit the new Acclaim vision?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “We look for teams with strong voices—developers who know what they want to say and how they want to say it through gameplay. Original mechanics, distinct art, or just a vibe that cuts through the mundane. The common thread is ambition, experimentation and just going for it. Even if it’s a small game, we want to feel that spark of ‘this couldn’t come from anyone else.’ And we are glad they want to be a part of the new Acclaim family.”</p><p><strong>How has your experience from the past shaped what you’re doing here with Acclaim?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “My past experience has given me a front-row seat to what indie devs really need from a publisher. I saw the challenges, the pressure points, and the opportunities to add value beyond just writing a check. At Acclaim, we’re building on that foundation but turning the dial up—we have a historic brand behind us, but we’re approaching developers with a completely new mindset. I value every experience and this venture with Acclaim is a brand new opportunity to share stories and art in a whole new way.”</p><p><strong>What makes Acclaim different from other indie publishers today? Why should a developer choose you to publish their project?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “I believe we have a mix that nobody else can offer. On one hand, we’ve got decades of brand recognition, Acclaim is a name that still resonates with gamers and media. On the other hand, we’re operating with a startup spirit: hands-on, nimble, and collaborative. Developers get the credibility of a legendary name with the intimacy of a true partner. That’s a powerful combination. Our team is second to none, and the dev teams that choose us are all the better for it.”</p><p><strong>Your games lineup spans everything from <a title="Genres > Roguelite [286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelites</a> to <a title="Genres > Rhythm [199 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> and <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [232 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a>s. What’s the unifying thread here?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “They all share personality. Whether it’s a rhythm game with style and swagger, or a roguelite with heart, each title feels distinct. The throughline isn’t a genre, it’s that every project carries attitude, creativity, and a sense of fun that feels unmistakably Acclaim. You will find various callbacks to older Acclaim titles in the styles of each of the games in the new line-up and we cannot wait for the community to thread that needle. Once they understand, it’s truly going to be like an Easter egg hunt on steroids.”</p><p><strong>What excites you most from your premiere lineup, and why do you think now is the best time to bring out these sorts of games?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “What excites me is the range. We have world premieres that introduce entirely new worlds, alongside projects that give a wink to gaming’s golden age. The timing feels right because players are hungry for that kind of variety again. In a landscape dominated by sequels, a slate like ours—eclectic, daring, original, can really break through. This is just the debut, we have a lot in the tank for announcements and partnerships that we will be dropping in the new year.”</p><p><strong>Some of your titles, like <em><a title="Games > Basketball Classics" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/basketball-classics">Basketball Classics</a></em> or <em><a title="Games > HYPERYuki: Snowboard Syndicate" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hyperyuki-snowboard-syndicate">HYPERYuki: Snowboard Syndicate</a></em>, feel nostalgic. How do you see them appealing to younger players?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “Nostalgia is the hook for older fans, but the real trick is making the games stand on their own for people who weren’t there the first time. <em>Basketball Classics</em> isn’t just a throwback – it’s fun, competitive, and authentic in a way new players can appreciate. <em>HYPERYuki</em> has that retro-future <a title="Platforms > Dreamcast" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/sega/dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> aesthetic, but it’s gameplay is pure modern energy. If you’re twelve years old and discovering it today, it just feels cool and refreshing.”</p><p><strong>What’s the plan after the reveal showcase? Will there be more showcases going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “Yes, this showcase is just the beginning. We’ll be back with more in the future for sure. Think of it as planting our flag in a Direct or State of Play kind of way, but otherworldly. The goal is to keep that dialogue with players alive, and to continue surprising them with what Acclaim is bringing next. This Showcase is meant to feel like a late night cable TV binge gone deep into the spiral of Retro Future Nostalgia, a place where everything is fun and comes from a place that is real and playfully surreal at the same time.”</p><p><strong>Are there any classic Acclaim titles you’d personally like to revisit if rights weren’t an issue?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “Of course, there are classics I grew up with that I’d love to see reimagined. But the focus right now is writing new stories, so if and when those opportunities come up, we’ll approach them from a place of strength. There are no lack of wants, it’s more if it makes sense for the players now.”</p><p><strong>What is your measure of success for this Acclaim revival?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “<a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [103 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> comes in layers. For developers, it’s seeing their games reach an audience they never thought possible. For us as a publisher, it’s sustainability and building a pipeline where each project finds its footing and fuels the next one. Of course, sales matter, but equally important is whether we’ve rebuilt Acclaim into a trusted name that gamers, our community and devs alike want to rally around.”</p><p><strong>To wrap up, can you share a final message for our readers about what Acclaim is today and why they should be excited for its future?</strong></p><p><strong>Josef:</strong> “Acclaim today is about channeling the raw energy that made the brand and logo unforgettable, but pointing it forward. We’re not the old guard, we’re a launchpad. If you love games that take risks, that make you feel something, and that come from passionate creators, then you should be excited. Acclaim is back, and we’re here to make some noise.”</p><p><strong>Thank you for your time, Alex!</strong></p><p>If you missed it, watch the full Play Acclaim showcase below.
