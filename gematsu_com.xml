Once meant to be humanity’s second home, it is now a hostile frontier of toxic skies, savage wildlife, and relentless storms. Every drop from orbit is a fight for survival. Build shelter, craft weapons, hunt for food, and seek your fortune in exotic matter.</p><p>Survive alone or with up to four players in this uncompromising player-versus-environment survival game from the creator of <em>DayZ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “New Frontiers” expansion is included from the start, transforming <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> into a larger, deadlier but more rewarding survival experience. Discover new maps, missions, creatures, and rewards.</p><p><strong>A Planet That Fights Back</strong></p><p>Icarus resists your presence; poisoned air, lightning storms that tear apart structures, wildfires that spread unchecked, and predators that stalk in the shadows. It feels like the planet itself wants to drive you back into orbit.</p><ul><li>With New Frontiers added from the start, you can explore two 64 km2 maps of handcrafted terrain across forests, mountains, deserts, and caves.</li><li>Harvest every tree, rock, and creature.</li><li>Adapt to extreme weather and natural disasters.</li></ul><p><strong>“New Frontiers” Included</strong></p><p>The Prometheus region, once sealed off by the UDA, is now open. Terraforming failed here completely, leaving raw alien landscapes intact but warped. This expansion expands Icarus far beyond its original borders:</p><ul><li><strong>New Map and Biomes</strong> – Alien grasslands, volcanic wastelands of molten lava, and dangerous swamplands.</li><li><strong>Six Narrative Missions</strong> – A chained story across Prometheus as you pursue a mysterious whistleblower for the UDA.</li><li><strong>New <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Face Needlers, Dracs, Dreadwings, and other mutated apex predators, evolved to dominate these zones.</li><li><strong>New Exotics</strong> – Discover a volatile new exotic with unique effects on the flora, plus new exotic plants and over 30 additional workshop items.</li><li><strong>New Items and Resources</strong> – Mine obsidian, clay, scoria, crystallised miasma, and super-cooled ice; craft 100+ new items including weapons, food, recipes, and building tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Three Ways to Survive</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World</strong> – Establish permanent bases and explore freely.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Timed contracts where extraction is everything.</li><li><strong>Outposts</strong> – Low-pressure zones for creative building and experimentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Progression and Reward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tech Tree and Talents</strong> – Advance from primitive tools to advanced tech.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> – Focus as a hunter, builder, or survivalist.</li><li><strong>Orbital Workshop</strong> – Trade exotic matter for permanent upgrades and equipment. Exotic matter remains the ultimate prize; rare, unstable, and deadly to pursue.</li></ul><p><strong>Solo or Cooperative Play</strong></p><p>Up to four players can share each drop, combining skills and resources to endure. Prefer to go it alone? Survive solo with a Solo Talent Tree for maximum challenge.</p><p>(Note: <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> does not support cross-play.)</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition – Official Announce Trailer | Coming to Xbox &amp; PlayStation in 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luKC7WUOKOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/icarus-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><p>A group of humans, calling themselves ‘The Stalkers,’ discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity found the ‘Seal of Night,’ an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity.
