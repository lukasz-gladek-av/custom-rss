The title features grand, beautiful visual depictions made possible by the RE ENGINE, Capcom’s proprietary game development engine, and crossplay, allowing players to enjoy the game together regardless of their game platform.</p><p>The title provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation®5 system, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and PC. Additionally, the introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems have provided an even more immersive gaming experience, while the fusion of numerous new elements with <em>Monster Hunter</em>‘s appeal has generated significant excitement, all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10 million units sold. Additionally, the first free Title Update is scheduled for April 4th, which will add a fan-favorite monster as well as the Grand Hub, a new in-game settlement where players can gather and communicate with each other. Going forward, Capcom plans to continue to release updates that will delight players, such as the second Title Update which is scheduled for release in the summer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
