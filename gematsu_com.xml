We strove to make every dice roll carry that same suspense and imagination of classic <a title="Genres > Board Game [49 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/board-game">board games</a> of old.

Marisa has vanished, and Shrine Maiden Reimu sets out to solve her mysterious disappearance. An oddly oversized book standing in Marisa’s room provides the only clue to her whereabouts. </p><p>As Reimu cracks open the book, magic envelops her, teleporting her inside the book to find the first trace of Marisa’s tracks. Determine fate with every roll of the dice on an adventure through a branching narrative of literary works. Read and experience each chapter to move through wondrous worlds.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Journey through part of the first chapter in the demo, with five chapters available at launch. With an unwritten future ahead, choose the path forward as story arc choices materialize on every page. Fight or flee from monsters, eat or bypass precariously placed morsels of food, and finish each chapter to create a one-of-a-kind adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>Marisa of Liartop Mountain</em> is due out for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514630/Marisa_of_Liartop_Mountain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
