Engage in high-octane cinematic Mech battles, recruit pilots and grow relationships. Play solo or join an online world where every character is procedurally generated.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity has lost the war against the machines. The world is overrun by them. What is left of the population has retreated to a few cities and outposts constructed atop of giant pillars.

Build and tune your Mechs. Recruit pilots and watch them bond aboard the airship: your mobile base. Complete contracts and engage in high-octane cinematic Mech battles featuring a unique Timeline system.

    <p><span>Try out the anime-juiced rhythm adventure game.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>A demo for rhythm <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > UNBEATABLE [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/unbeatable">UNBEATABLE</a></em> is now available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,290 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,399 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Store and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,928 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">Steam</a>, publisher <a title="Companies > Playstack [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/playstack">Playstack</a> and developer <a title="Companies > D-CELL [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/d-cell">D-CELL</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-959440"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Playstack:</p><blockquote><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em> is an anime-juiced rhythm adventure where you (figuratively) destroy on stage while you (literally) destroy on stage. During <a title="Genres > Rhythm [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>play, you only need two buttons: a button for up and a button for down. Simple to understand! The complicated part is doing it. Try not to get destroyed yourself.</p><p>Half the game is walking around and taking things at your own pace. The other half is trying to keep up with ours.</p><p>The pink-haired girl is Beat, and she is you, and you have a lot of things to worry about. The cops are everywhere, and they are mad at you for what feels like no good reason. Though it doesn’t help your case that you keep making friends with people that the cops are mad at for slightly better reasons. But what do I know?</p><p>Talk to people, help them out (or don’t, I’m not your mom!), play huge concerts, and punch cops. And then run away from the cops you punched. Also there are monsters or something. Not sure what’s going on there?!?!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here. It’ll get you through it.</p><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em>‘s full arcade mode is an entire game by itself with its own progression system and a full online component. There’s modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!) and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as “beat a song on easy mode” to, one may presume, something as complicated as “solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.” That’s not a real example.</p></blockquote><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Demo Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: GAMEPLAY TRAILER 2.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwKFOZeJukA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bursting at the seams with dungeon-crawling hijinks, <em>9th Dawn Re</em>make lovingly riffs on the original <em>9th Dawn</em> game—evamping the combat and streamlining quests to deliver a novel, exhilarating <em>9th Dawn</em> experience. <em>9th Dawn Remake</em> has also been localized into French, Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese!</p><p><strong>New Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
