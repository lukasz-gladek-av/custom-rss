Lead investigations, uncover grand conspiracies, master tactical combat, and wage a secret war against heresy. Make tough choices as a conduit of the God-Emperor’s will.</p><p><strong>Innocence Proves Nothing</strong></p><p>Embrace the role of an Inquisitor in the grim darkness of the far future in a cRPG set in the rich Warhammer 40,000 universe. Start your service as an acolyte of the Inquisition: Investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and shape the fate of the Calixis Sector in a story-rich experience where every decision has weight, justice is non-existent, and the line between salvation and damnation is razor-thin. Explore an in-depth depiction of the Inquisition as an organization and the vast force it commands: its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As an Inquisitor, you have one primary goal: to protect the Imperium, whether that be from the taint of xenos, the betrayal of heretics, or the scourge of mutants, by any means necessary. Be the conduit of the Emperor’s will in a place where all hope was lost decades ago, explore the mysteries of the maddening Tyrant Star, and overcome the worst horrors thrown at you by the Noctis Aeterna.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_966519"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Uncover the Truth, No Matter the Cost</strong></p><p>Your duty is to investigate heresy deep within the Calixis Sector. Your craft is to expose the hidden rot in places where no one else dares to look, to be the final defense of Humanity in the face of annihilation. Uncover nefarious plots, interrogate suspects, and piece together conspiracies in a deep investigative system. The only question is, how far are you willing to go on the path of damnation in the name of salvation?</p><p><strong>You Are Not <a title="Games > Alone in the Dark (2024) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/alone-in-the-dark-2024">Alone in the Dark</a>ness</strong></p><p>Every Inquisitorial warband is unique, and yours is no exception. Ranging from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each and every one of them offers distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues.</p><p><strong>Fight on Your Terms</strong></p><p>Turn-based combat rewards careful planning and ruthless efficiency: target enemy weak points and keep each party member’s morale high to gain the upper hand in every battle. Managing their individual morale effectively will maximize their combat potential. Complex yet elegant systems ensure deep interactivity, making every decision in combat impactful and every kill brutally satisfying.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Accompanied by her brother Michael you will traverse unfamiliar places, character conflicts, and story affecting decision making. You have the power to help the world or let it rot. Careful your presence has caught the attention of something sinister…</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Many indie <a title="Genres > RPG [17,266 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> claim to be a new quirky game, but <em>Away From Home</em> is a mix of many great RPGs. The characters are full of emotion and let you empathize with them. Don’t forget that this world needs you.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Imagine if a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> and a Rhythm game had a love child. This game plays like Earthbound when it comes to walking and talking in it’s overworld, but when it comes to missions and battles it throws in <a title="Genres > Rhythm [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> related to the event. Characters also have real voices to help create mood and feeling to them. The big highlight of the gameplay is the huge amount of animations. The characters in this world are alive and through your gameplay you will begin to understand.</p><p>The amount of things to do in locations are never ending. Chocked full of lengthy side missions that unlock you new moves and items as well as random chance based events. The progression of side quests and random town events are based from entertaining games such as <em><a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> 0</em>!</p><p>The world is large and will take you hours to complete everything, not to mention alternate routes that bring replayability. Some routes include game changing decisions as well as items and battles you wouldn’t be able to do had you made different choices.</p><p><strong>Battles</strong></p><p>The battles are in a third-person view with rhythm-based function. The UI has a fight button, special button, items button, and block button. Using arrow keys your <a title="Genres > Action [2,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will be in sync with the music. If you press a key on the beat, you gain action points for special attacks.</p><p>For the first time, skill and strategy are balanced out by the battle system. You will need to use skill to time your choices and hits in time. Mean while you will need to use strategy to counteract opponents special attacks. Such as if you have an opponent with poison, you will want to apply anti poison items in your arsenal. Both you planning and action will be put to the test.</p><p>Items are unlocked by completion of side quests and can be purchased at the stores, some items are very powerful and can only be received once. You must plan three items to bring into battle and have immediately available. As well as unlock special moves that pair well with your arsenal.</p><p>The battles are stocked full of special effects to keep the fight lively! Rather than being told what’s happening around you like in a traditional RPG, you will get to witness everything from falling confetti to flashes of lightning!</p><p>Enemies have special attacks as well. Enemy specials send you into a full on quick time event with high detailed pixel art. Where you must hit provided keys. Failure to hit them in time results in major damage taken.</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>This game has may talented artists including yours truly. We bring life to the game in visually stunning ways. We focus on facial expression as well as detailed animation. Many people have poured their souls into this project. Some animations in the game took over 100 hours and I’m exited for you to see them.</p><p>We hope to convey emotion and expression in ways similar to games like Mother 3. With the high rendered detail in this game, every pixel counts. One pixel could change frown to a smile. So attention to detail goes a long way.</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>This game has an outstanding soundtrack so far. Music determines so much in a game such as mood, atmosphere, and tension. The original soundtrack has many amazing artists including NickNuwe, Chaotrope, Zakku, and Nelward.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
