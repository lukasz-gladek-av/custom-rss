Foster fur-ocious firepower, raising a weapon of mass destruction that gains combat prowess through positive affirmations, cuddles, and a steady diet of seeds. Unravel a warm story filled with good-humored banter, keeping things light in a post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>Unleash destructive havoc against incoming threats to save the nation from collapse. Grab the tiny hamster, point it towards approaching enemies, and watch MOCHI-O obliterate approaching enemy ships with its ever-evolving abilities in tower defense-style combat. </p><p>Outfit MOCHI-O with various weapons and abilities, and feast on bundles of seeds dropped by defeated foes to gain XP. Collect enough seeds to level up MOCHI-O’s base attributes, like firing rate, crit chance, attack range, and cooldown reductions to create a custom playstyle.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As the caretaker’s bond with MOCHI-O increases, so does its firepower! Outside of battle, encourage MOCHI-O with pets, feeding, and decorate its room to create an ideal environment for bonding to unlock upgrades and new weapons.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="MOCHI-O - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvP-rdNyvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/mochi-o-for-pc-launches-january-19]]></content:encoded>
