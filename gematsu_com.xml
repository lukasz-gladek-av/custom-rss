A sudden dismemberment murder of the leader of a religious nation that advocates an apocalyptic ideology… Five <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,512 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> are combined into one, centered around a suspenseful story full of mystery and intrigue.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>“168 remaining until the end of the world…”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity is approaching its end.</p><p>In a world steeped in despair and chaos, a strange religious organization called Shuten Order emerges, yearning for the end of humanity. The group rapidly gains followers, eventually forming a small nation state called Shuten.</p><p>Tragedy strikes during the grand festival celebrating their nation’s founding—the leader of the Shuten Order is murdered. Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder? For what reason? Can the mission be fulfilled before time runs out?</p><p>Thus begins a high-stakes, four-day hunt for the truth.</p><p><strong>Gameplay and Game Systems</strong></p><p>The story branches into five distinct routes, each tied to a suspect and completely altering the narrative and gameplay.
