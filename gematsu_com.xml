It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2902600/Call_of_Elyndra/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, with the possibility of later console ports. A demo will be available on December 2. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-928318"></span></p><p>Get the first details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Call of Elyndra</em> is the debut game of Quorum Games. The game combines the best things from the <a title="Platforms > SNES" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/snes">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>-era <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> (think <em>Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> or <em>Ys</em> games) with cozy farm games (like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or <em>Harvest Moon</em>). The players will be free to choose how they want to play the game—whether they want to do both farming and questing or just one or the other.</p><p>The game tells a story about three adventurers (you play as one of them) who, led by an odd dream, wandered to Elyndra—a village in the middle of nowhere. After helping the locals with retrieving a child kidnapped by monsters, the three are granted a plot of land to farm. However, a military conflict between independent villages and an evil Empire is brewing. You’re thrust right into it. What will you do?</p><p>All of the assets in the game are hand-made in a detailed pixel-art style, reminiscent of Game Boy Advance games. You’ll traverse through varied landscapes, from forests through mountaintops to beaches. These places will be filled with various NPCs, locations to explore, and quests to take. Aside from unveiling the story, you’ll gather various tools that will help you with combat and traversal. What if you want to stay in Elyndra and farm? Various intricacies of farming and crafting systems, along with building relationships with various villagers, will also present a great way of progressing through the game. Of course, simultaneous farming and questing are also possible.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928325"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the game combines the best of two worlds, it’s able to address certain possibly undesirable characteristics of both old school action RPGs and cozy games. Some of its features include:</p><ul><li>An expansive storyline that is expected to last for about 30-plus hours of gameplay.</li><li>Character development- some of which will be quite substantial.</li><li>Plenty of various fun side activities like fishing to keep the gameplay varied.</li><li>A world with a deep lore inspired by various real-world ancient religions and cultures.</li><li>Roughly 30 hours of core gameplay.</li><li>A real-time combat system with dodge rolls, items, and special powers to aid you in your <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.</li></ul><p>The engine used to make the game used to be <em>RPG Maker</em>, however approximately 70 percent of the code is custom-made.</p><p>You will be able to give the full version of the game a go in the near future, as the release date remains to be announced. A demo will release on December 2, which will feature roughly 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay, showing the very beginning of the game, including farming, the first dungeon, and the reveal of the primary antagonist of the game.</p><p>The game is expected to be released on Steam for Windows, with the possibility of later console ports.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

    <p><span>Plus new combat and synthesis details.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gust [798 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a> have released a new trailer, information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a></em> introducing new combat and synthesis details. Plus, over 30 minutes of gameplay was showcased during this weekend’s second official broadcast for the game. <span id="more-928098"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. Mysterious characters obsessed with alchemy such as a Noble in a Black Cloak (voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki), a Monocular Werewolf (voiced by Takehito Koyasu), a Sheep-Eye Witch (voiced by Yoko Hikasa), and a Dragon-Winged Warrior (voiced by Takaya Kuroda) stand in Yumia’s way.</p><p>To prepare for the adventure ahead, players will rediscover the <em>Atelier</em> franchise’s signature synthesizing system in a fresh form by manipulating “mana” to create new items useful in combat or exploration. To create more powerful items, fans will have to master the art of “Resonance Synthesis” by adding ingredients which resonate with each other to the “Alchemy Core” of the recipe. The strength of the resonance will depend on the quality of the ingredients selected.</p><p>The combat system has also been revamped in <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> to offer intense real-time combat with intuitive gameplay. The skills available to active team members will depend on their distance from the enemy (close or ranged combat). Compared to previous instalments, players can now move or interchange characters at any time during the fight. When certain conditions are met, a powerful “Friend Action” combo can be unleashed in battle. By meeting certain conditions, players will be able to activate “Mana Surge,” which will allow for exclusive actions to be performed. In addition, each character will have a unique special move, “Maximize Mana Surge,” which can inflict significant damage on enemies.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928270"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Journeying alongside Yumia and her friends, players will explore the vast open world of the Aladiss continent. As they travel, they will be able to build their own bases. Thanks to the new “Building” feature, fans will freely be able to create and decorate their atelier from a vast choice of walls, floors, roofs, furniture, and more, or choose to select a predefined base model from the catalog. By increasing the “comfort level” of their atelier, players will unlock bonuses such as the ability to develop their base and enhance the skills of Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Lastly, if players do not wish to return to their base during exploration, they will be able to set up a camp where they can spend time cooking, which will provide various benefits during exploration and combat, or resting. Certain character events that can only be seen at camps will sometimes occur, providing greater insight into Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Everyone who purchases either a physical or digital edition up to two weeks after release will receive the “Athlete of Memories” early purchase costume for Yumia, the “Floating Object of Memories” costume for Flammi, and the unique “Training Wrist Weight” equipment.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,626 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21, 2025 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.
