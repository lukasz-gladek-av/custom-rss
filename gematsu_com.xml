While the game is technically finished, reaching this final stretch has shown us that we need just a few more weeks to ensure the experience is exactly what you deserve. We want the version of <em>REPLACED</em> you play on day one to be polished, stable, and true to the vision we’ve shared with you.</p><p>The response to our Steam demo has been the ultimate fuel for us. To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible. We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Your patience and support over the years have meant the world to us. Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it. We are super close to the finish line and we can’t wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work. And if you’d like a first glimpse of <em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;before the big day, the demo is still live on Steam.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding, your kindness, and for being such a vital part of this journey.

Designed from the ground up for voice chat chaos, the game brings nostalgic 3D platforming to modern social play.</p><p>Swing, bounce, and launch your ‘Nauts through physics-driven platforming challenges while an original liquid drum and bass soundtrack sets the pace. Coordinate with up to seven friends in eight-player multiplayer as you navigate levels designed for creative solutions and shared chaos. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In one challenge, players must coordinate to swing each other across gaps—calling out timing as physics sends plans hilariously sideways.
