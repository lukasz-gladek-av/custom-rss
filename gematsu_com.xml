What was supposed to be a routine expedition has become a fight for human survival. As exploration begins, the subterranean world reveals itself as a living, reactive ecosystem. It is no longer just a mission, it’s a transformation, a challenge to integrate and thrive in a world where survival hinges on your ability to learn, adapt, and symbiotize.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_972024"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
