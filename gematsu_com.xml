    <div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > CRITICAL REFLEX [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/critical-reflex">CRITICAL REFLEX</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Hey Bird!" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hey-bird">Hey Bird!</a> have announced occult detective <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,755 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Inkblood" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/inkblood">Inkblood</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4114100/Inkblood/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1011703"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via CRITICAL REFLEX:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>You’re an Inquisitor following a trail of death. A cult is at work, your predecessor has vanished, and the region teeters on the edge of chaos. Find the truth. Uphold the Inquisition. Do not fail.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Uncover the Truth</strong> – You are uniquely equipped to solve this mystery. Besides your wit, keen eye, and intuition, your carriage provides you with some more… advanced tools. Inspect the clues, take photos of everything important, compile a case file and dial your overseer once you have a strong theory.</li><li><strong>Explore the Land</strong> – Don’t expect to find everything in one place. The investigation will surely have you riding back and forth in some bizarre, perhaps even unsettling locations. Just tap the map on the coachman’s back to choose your next stop, whether it’s the city of Inqburg, deadly swamps, abandoned villages, or rite sites.</li><li><strong>Dwell Into the Past</strong> – You are equipped with a magnifying glass, which allows you to peek into the past. Use it: nothing is certain in the present until the past is untangled. Wonder what the villagers were up to last night? Peek into that fragment of the past through their windows!</li><li><strong>Eradicate the Occult</strong> – It is nothing short of foolish to assume one case has no relation to another. In your position, you’re expected to see the big picture – no detail is insignificant, and sometimes a small clue from an old case might lead to the greatest of revelations.</li><li><strong>(Don’t) Tamper With Your Carriage</strong> – Your carriage is your home, as well as your prison. Its compartments may be of help in your search, though some of them are not to be opened. Be careful with it, don’t tamper with things you don’t understand. Remember – the Inquisition always learns the truth.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>Five days until the first-ever election, a tea shop explodes in the heart of the city. They send you to deal with the mess.</p><p>You wake up in a morgue with half the river in your boots, surrounded by ten thousand rotting apples, several corpses, and one zombie. Out of your depth and with no official backup, you delve into your beloved city to investigate the impossible mystery no one wants you to solve. Juggle factions and play them against each other. Explore the streets and tunnels of a fantasy metropolis. Debate devils, drunk sphinxes, and all manner of fantastical fools in a world where mythological creatures sell newspapers at corner shops and ideologies overtake the ramblings of dead gods.</p><p>Don’t forget the most important question: What are you voting in the election?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Make Choices That Will Come Back to Bite You</strong> – Shifting alliances!

But remember, in true TTRPG fashion, failure can often be way more interesting.</li><li><strong>It’s All in Your Head</strong> – Debate yourself! Each Ability Stat has a conflicting viewpoint and loves to interrupt important conversations. No matter whose side you fall on, you’ll complete quests in wonderfully ridiculous ways.</li><li><strong>Wield Reality-Shaping Magic</strong> – Use The Cleric’s power for unique narrative choices. Control minds for fun and profit. Detect secrets in the tunnels below or in the thoughts of your enemies. Speak with anyone, living or dead, just to see how they insult you.</li><li><strong>Turn-Based Encounters</strong> – Clerics in Norvik are taught to use violence as a last resort. When the need does arise, a roll of the dice determines life or death. But you always have a bizarre solution to any problem, don’t you?</li><li><strong>The <a title="Platforms > Quest [163 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>ing Tree</strong> – Your quest log, skill tree, and mind map all at once.
