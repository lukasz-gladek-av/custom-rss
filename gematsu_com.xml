    <p><span>Introducing Nod-Krai, the next major region in Tevyat.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> I update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue,” will launch on September 10, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [203 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-988935"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As players conclude their journey through Natlan, they can now set sail north to explore Nod-Krai’s three island territories and meet its inhabitants. In the new Archon Quests, Travelers will join Lauma of the Frostmoon Scions in the fight against the Fatui, stand alongside Flins to resist the relentless “Wild Hunt,” and encounter new allies in Nasha Town. The Fatui’s plot to claim the moon’s power comes to light with the arrival of the Fatui Harbinger, “Marionette,” also known as Sandrone. Meanwhile, Columbina—once known as another Harbinger, “The Damselette”—has withdrawn to her birthplace in Nod-Krai, where she is revered as the Moon Maiden. Meeting her may grant Travelers powerful blessings for their journey. To begin their adventure in Nod-Krai, players can unlock the region after completing Mondstadt’s main story and reaching Adventure Rank 28, or continue into the new Archon Quests after finishing Liyue’s storyline.</p><p>In Nod-Krai, an ancient elemental force known as Kuuvahki permeates the land, shaping both its terrain and its living beings. Players can draw upon this power, hidden within plants, mechanisms, and even the land itself, to overcome challenges in exploration. They may also take on the form of a unique elemental lifeform, the Kuuhenki, gliding swiftly along small patches of mist and Moonlanes. In battle, Kuuvahki reveals itself in both enemies and allies, requiring Travelers to devise targeted strategies to prevail—and granting certain characters the ability to unleash special Lunar Reactions.</p><p>In Version Luna I, three new characters from Nod-Krai will join the playable roster. Lauma, the Moonchanter and a five-star Catalyst wielder, introduces the new Lunar-Bloom reaction with her Dendro powers. Utilizing the Verdant Dew, a special resource generated from the Lunar-Bloom reaction, she can boost her team’s Bloom-related damage. With her unique bond with animals, she can even take on a half-human, half-deer form to sprint and leap with agility. Flins, a five-star Polearm wielder, commands Electro with Lunar-Charged strikes—unleashing either a devastating single blow or a storm of spear attacks. As an experienced Lightkeeper, he can also hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration. Meanwhile, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore wielder and creator of Ineffa, brings both mechanical ingenuity and a touch of home. Her workshop and inventions, including the duck-shaped combat device “Knuckle Duckle,” add playful new interactions to the adventure. Players can recruit Aino to their party for free by progressing through the new Archon Quests in Nod-Krai.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988936"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The new feature “Meeting Points” will let players step into the daily lives of their companions: relive the legends of the Frostmoon Scions with Lauma, explore the bustling Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop with Aino and Ineffa, or uncover the long-kept stories of the Lightkeepers at Flins’s home. In Version Luna I, the first half will feature Lauma alongside Nahida’s rerun in the Event Wishes, together with a Sumeru-themed Chronicled Wish. The second half brings Flins, Aino, and Yelan’s rerun.</p><p>New optimizations and rewards are set to make your adventure even smoother. Adventure EXP can now be earned through more diverse means, speeding up leveling progress, while harvestable materials will be added to the Battle Pass rewards. In this version, you’ll be able to preview the locked affix of an Artifact in advance and save more team presets with the expanded party setup slots. The biggest change comes with the introduction of Masterless Stella Fortuna, an item that lets you convert the extra 5-star Stella Fortuna to push characters beyond the current cap—all the way to Level 100. And to celebrate both the update and Genshin Impact’s 5th Anniversary, there’s a whole lineup of rewards waiting: a free 5-star character of your choice from the Standard Wish pool, Intertwined Fate ×10 from the login event, Primogems ×1,600 via in-game mail, two special Nod-Krai–themed gadgets, and more.</p><p>Additionally, Genshin Impact announced more details of “Miliastra Wonderland,” the much-anticipated UGC Gameplay System that will allow players to create and enjoy stages made by fellow gamers. Equipped with the “Miliastra Sandbox” editor tool, creators can harness Genshin Impact’s existing systems and assets to design and share a wide variety of fresh experiences, ranging from simulations and party games, to survival challenges and more. Starting with Version Luna II, Miliastra Wonderland will become available, expanding Genshin Impact’s gameplay in bold new ways.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,825 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.
