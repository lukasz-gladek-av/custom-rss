      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Arc System Works [1,301 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > DAMON and BABY [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/damon-and-baby">DAMON and BABY</a></em>, an action game. Platforms and a release date were not announced.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Arc System Works:</p><blockquote><p>An action game, not a fighting game, made by the developers at Arc System Works!</p><p>This new project is the first step towards that future! <em>DAMON and BABY</em>!</p><p>This is the tale of the Demon King who was cursed to never be able to part from a human child. The journey to release the curse begins!<br>More information to come!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“The game market is tough now,” said Arc System Works chief creative officer Daisuke Ishiwatari during today’s Arc System Works Showcase announcing the project. “To overcome that Arc System Works has launched a new project. It’s an action game project… Let me explain. Arc System Works is a fighting game company. I’m sure most of you recognize us as so. However, to achieve a new brand, where we are known for quality mid-range <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games.</p><p>“You might be wondering why I specifically use the term mid-range. There are many reasons, but one is that even creators themselves can enjoy striving for their dreams. In recent years, with AAA blockbusters and excellent indie titles gaining popularity, it has become extremely risky for companies to create new series. This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes and to accumulate technology and know-how.</p><p>“Our flagship title <em>Guilty Gear</em> has now become a million selling copy work—but its very first installment was a small-scale project. From there, over many long years, we built a foundation that could guarantee a certain level of quality in the fighting games genre. Similarly we hope to take a step with this project that will eventually lead to bigger dreams. And precisely because they are mid-range titles, this will create many opportunities to produce many titles and cultivate many creators, and we hope that will become one of the future values of Arc System Works.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DAMON and BABY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBEFzd4zr-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/arc-system-works-announces-action-game-damon-and-baby]]></content:encoded>

Select your captain from Mushroom Kingdom mainstays like Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and Waluigi, and jump into a bevy of modes like Grudge Match, Cup Battles and Custom Battles. In this arena, matches unfold with white-hot speed and intensity, and with no referees to dish out penalties, the only thing containing the mayhem is the electrified fence that surrounds the field!</p><p>Plus, obtain familiar items, like shells and mushrooms, to add to the chaos and give yourself a boost during matches. But the real key to winning is the Super Strike: a powerful shot that can net you two points at once! Hone your techniques, deal out big hits and even unleash Chain Chomp onto the field as you aim to score a goal—and crush the opposition. With simple controls, anyone can hit the pitch while playing solo, and in local1 and online multiplayer matches for up to four players.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Super Mario Strikers</em> Trailer</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->

In the years since the discovery of Lunam Ore, humanity has developed Lunafilament, a material capable of replicating almost anything. One day without warning, Earth lost contact with the lunar research station dedicated to this Lunafilament, as all signals went dark.</p><p>Today’s footage delves deeper into this out-of-this-world adventure. The journey follows Hugh Williams, who is dispatched to the moon as part of a team to investigate what happened. When a lunar quake suddenly strikes the facility, Hugh is separated from his team, injured, and knocked unconscious. In this moment, he’s rescued by an enigmatic Pragmata, a unique android created using Lunafilament, who has the appearance of a young girl. As the unlikely duo joins forces to fend off the station’s rampaging bots, Hugh nicknames his newfound companion “Diana,” and they embark on a mission to escape the lunar station and return to Earth.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_976420"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In <em>PRAGMATA</em>, Hacking and shooting are at the core of gameplay. During combat, a panel will appear on screen while aiming at enemies. This represents Diana’s ability to hack into foes’ defenses. By maneuvering the cursor through this panel, she can take down their armor and provide openings for Hugh to blast enemy weak points with his arsenal of weapons. This system will challenge players to think on the fly to overcome multisided situations in the heat of battle.</p><p>Exploration is also a team effort. Diana can utilize her Hacking abilities outside of combat to access the facility’s systems and remove environmental barriers that block progress. Meanwhile, Hugh can make use of his suit’s thrusters to traverse the lunar station’s terrain. By combining their skills and abilities, they can achieve feats that would be impossible alone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for <em>PRAGMATA</em> is now fully open. Alongside new information about the game, the site includes a “Hacking Minigame” allowing players to experience part of the game’s unique combat system before <em>PRAGMATA</em> launches. Before then, the game will be playable at Gamescom 2025 and other events.</p></blockquote><p><em>PRAGMATA</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,819 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,474 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3357650/PRAGMATA/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the <em>PRAGMATA</em> segment of today’s Capcom Spotlight below.

Grace will experience horror from the same perspective as the player as she learns to overcome her fears throughout the course of the story. Though timid, she’s also trained with firearms and uses deductive reasoning to stay calm under pressure.</p><p>The team has also gone to great lengths to deliver an unprecedented level of realism, down to minute character details like the redness of Grace’s face as she’s hanging upside down, and the natural movement of her hair, modeled in part using a custom-made wig as reference.</p><p>As shared previously, players will be able to freely switch between both first- and third-person perspectives throughout the game. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the horror up close and personal with tense, realistic gameplay in first-person perspective, or use the over-the-shoulder camera with third-person perspective that allows you to create a more <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-heavy gameplay experience.</p><!-- AD: content -->
