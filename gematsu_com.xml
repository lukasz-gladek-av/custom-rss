Serving as the final era of the samurai, the stage is set in 1800s Kyoto, where the land and iconic landmarks such as the Kiyomizu and Honnoji temples have been overtaken and transformed by the Crucible’s influence. </p><p>In addition to encountering new and fearsome yokai, players will also face the Shinsengumi, a military squad that serves the shogunate. Shinsengumi troops are challenging foes equipped with modern weaponry such as firearms and gatling guns, delivering a combination of ranged and multi-directional attacks—a first in the history of the <em>Nioh</em> series. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During their journey, players will encounter a new cast of distinctive characters unique to each time period. In Bakumatsu-era Kyoto, protagonist Tokugawa Takechiyo will meet Takasugi Shinsaku, Okita Soji, and Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the 15th shogun of the Edo shogunate.</p></blockquote><p><em>Nioh 3</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,899 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,845 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 6, 2026.</p><p>View the screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/nioh-3/november-21-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_1008708"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/nioh-3-reveals-bakumatsu-period]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Durin joins the fray and the story of Nod-Krai continues.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> III update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Interlude – A <a title="Games > Nocturne [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nocturne">Nocturne</a> of the Far North,” will launch on December 3, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1008674"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The story of Nod-Krai continues as the region prepares for “Moon-Prayer Night,” a grand festival that also marks the Dameselette’s final night before her journey to the moon. Besides the celebration, Durin, the newborn dragon, makes his debut as a playable character, displaying his dual forms in battle. Players can also unlock new abilities for Durin and other “Hexerei characters” by completing special quests related to the Hexenzirkel.</p><p>After the defeat of Rächer of Solnari, Nasha Town comes back alive with the lively atmosphere of Moon-Prayer Night. Players are invited to enjoy the celebration, explore various game stalls, and record their memories in a souvenir stamp book, savoring precious moments before the Dameselette returns to the moon. During the celebration, unexpected guests show up—the Hexenzirkel has arrived. Alice, Klee’s mother, and Nicole Reeyn, who previously guided the player in understanding Fontaine’s prophecy, finally reveal themselves with alarming news: Teyvat’s borders are becoming unstable, and strange “phantoms” are appearing across Nod-Krai. Players will join Albedo, Durin, and the Wanderer in uncovering the mystery behind them. Completing this latest Archon Quest will also grant Primogems ×500 for a limited time.</p><p>Another highlight is Durin, a 5-star Pyro Sword wielder who possesses two distinctly different combat forms, and can be served either as a team support or a strong damage dealer. Once a dragon from the fairytale world of Simulanka, Durin was later granted a human body through Albedo’s alchemy and the transfer of the dragon Durin’s heart energy. This unique origin grants Durin dual powers: One reflects the pure soul of Simulanka, supporting the team by reducing enemies’ Elemental Resistance and dealing AoE Pyro DMG. The other is imbued with Abyssal energy, excelling at unleashing devastating attacks on single targets and boosting his own Vaporize and Melt reaction DMG. Completing Durin’s Story Quest will reveal more secrets about the dragon and Hexenzirkel, and gain a special reward for Durin.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1008675"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Version Luna III also introduces a major update featuring “Hexerei characters,” enhancing certain characters closely connected to the Hexenzirkel. By completing Alice’s “Witch’s Homework,” Durin, Venti, Klee, Albedo, Mona, Razor, Fischl, and Sucrose can become Hexerei characters. Each quest unfolds a unique story for the respective character, granting them special abilities and changing their Constellation effects. Additionally, if the party has at least two Hexerei characters, “Hexerei: Secret Rite” effect will be unlocked, significantly boosting the party’s combat capabilities. For example, Venti, the Anemo Archon with a deep connection to the Hexenzirkel, will regain his once-hidden power after completing the quest. When his Stormeye is active, his Normal Attack will be transformed into powerful “Windsunder Arrows” that can pierce enemies and have a chance to further extend the Duration of his Stormeye. Players can view the full enhancement details in the new gadget “The Little Witch’s Dictionary.” After completing the prerequisite quest, players can freely invite Razor, Fischl, or Sucrose to their party.</p><p>Jahoda, the new 4-star Anemo Bow wielder, joins the adventure as well, showcasing her exceptional talents in team-healing and absorbing Elements to deal corresponding DMG. For Event Wishes in Version Luna III, the first phase will feature the debut of Durin and Jahoda and Venti’s return, and the second phase will bring back Varesa and Xilonen.</p><p>More activities and events will be available in Version Luna III. The event “Soulblazers’ Snowbound Journey” will bring players back to Dragonspine, where they can experience with winter-themed minigames and earn rewards, including an exclusive 4-star weapon “Rainbow Serpent’s Rain Bow,” Primogems, and more. Back in Nod-Krai, more stories and interactions with the Dameselette await players in Silvermoon Hall. Additionally, the Envisage Echoes challenges will be updated, adding Klee’s and Albedo’s echoes as rewards.</p><p>The UGC gameplay module Miliastra Wonderland will also receive brand-new updates in Version Luna III. The new “Wonderland Resource Center” allows Craftspeople to freely share and obtain resources and creative content via the editing tool. More rewards can be unlocked in this version, including fun actions, expressions, and free pulls. In addition, a winter-themed Main Hall will also be available to players during this version.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,899 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,845 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.
