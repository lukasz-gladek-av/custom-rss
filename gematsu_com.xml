There are outposts to pillage, ruins to explore, giant worms to admire, and suspiciously large amounts of leather clothing to wonder about. Oh, and don’t forget that mysterious vault door… What could be behind it?

In the Baadlands, you take up the hooves of Baallistic Pilgor, the antihero and survivor of the apocalypse, to complete calamitous quests, scavenge for goat gears, and enjoy a plethora of post-apocalyptic parody in this mad new world of mutants and mystery.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The brand new trailer shared today showcased some of the more unique things players can expect to come across in the Baadlands, including wacky wagons of maximum madness, leather-wearing townsfolk, and giant dune-dwelling worms…</p><p>Players will also have access to a customizable motorcycle to traverse the sandy landscape in style, while ruining people’s days with loud motorcycle noises and tires to the face.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Breach Expedition</strong></p><p>In Breach, players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and on their travels encounter the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to your corvette-building arsenal.</p><p>Excavating these wrecks will yield an array of corvette pieces including rare vertical parts which unlock a whole new range of build configurations for the more creative designers.</p><p>Among the exclusive expedition rewards, there is also a set of Atlas-themed modules for those wanting to demonstrate their allegiance to the all-seeing entity.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The jewel in the crown of these wreckages is the Fireship Arcadia, the fate of which you will learn as you venture through Breach. But you will have to face your fears and make a leap of faith into the black as you space-walk through these eerie systems to glean their unique remnants.</p><p>The spooky Breach Expedition embraces the darker side of the universe and will also lure the bravest Travellers towards the ominous and exotic purple-star solar systems which players first glimpsed in Worlds Part II back in January. The planets in these systems are particularly foreboding with their deep, abyssal oceans, unearthly entities and the notoriously imposing and volatile gas giants.</p><p>The Breach Expedition begins today, and will run for approximately three weeks.</p><p><strong>Space Wreckage</strong></p><p>In the far reaches of deep space, wrecked corvettes can now be encountered and salvaged. Step out into zero-gravity to explore these hollow hulks, and equip your Multi-Tool laser to dismantle their valuable modules – then repurpose this scrap to build your dream ship at a Corvette Workshop.</p><p><strong>New Corvette Modules</strong><br>A significant number of new corvette modules are now salvageable from deep-space corvette wrecks and planetary scrapheaps. These include new landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and a number of highly-requested wedge-shaped modules that enable a huge variety of creative and complicated corvette builds.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life</strong></p><p>In addition to the bundle of fixes, improvements, and new features in today’s update, the <em>No Man’s Sky</em> team have been hard at work on improving Voyagers since its launch in August. Notably, snapping is greatly improved, collision is more robust, and the Corvette Workshop now offers the option to apply a colour palette to an entire corvette. There has never been a better time to build a corvette!</p><p><strong>Breach Expedition Rewards</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Event Horizon [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/event-horizon">Event Horizon</a>, <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars Posters</p><p>These decorative posters commemorating the Breach expedition depict a deep-space gravitational anomaly, the tileable eternal serpent of time, and a betentacled siren, poised to begin its mucal embrace…</p><p><strong>Aeron Cowling and Diffuser</strong></p><p>The geometry of these corvette modules is ancient and unmistakable, shaped by the <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son heartbeat of the universe itself.</p><p>The extruded Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates add a bold, angular appearance to your corvette’s silhouette.</p><p><strong>Wings of Aeron</strong></p><p>This Atlas-themed wing module stabilises the corvette during atmospheric flight.</p><p><strong>Aeron Powershield</strong></p><p>The Aeron Powershield is linked to the corvette’s shielding system, providing a significant performance boost to the ship’s defence array.</p><p><strong>Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar, and Aeron <a title="Companies > Pyramid [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/colopl/pyramid">Pyramid</a></strong></p><p>These decorative Atlas-themed modules can be affixed to the corvette exterior, furthering the ship’s devotion to the crimson entity.</p><p><strong>Aeron Starship Trail</strong></p><p>This engine modification injects the Starship exhaust trail with an arterial streak of crimson.</p><p><strong>Aeron Drive and Aeron Blade</strong></p><p>Design a hefty, heavyweight Atlas corvette with the bulky Aeron Drive, or favour a more lightweight, sleek aesthetic with the streamlined Aeron Blade wing.</p><p><strong>Development Update</strong></p><p>It has been a crazy year for the <em>No Man’s Sky</em> team, with barely a breath taken between Worlds Part II, Relics, Beacon, and Voyagers. We’re so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch. Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can’t wait for you to see what we have in store in future.</p><p>Our journey continues.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/no-mans-sky-breach-update-now-available]]></content:encoded>
