As Anku, an Aymara boy with a unique gift, you’ll harness the power of color to shape the environment itself, uncovering hidden paths to navigate challenging and complex puzzles.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Single Player</strong> – Bring the world around you to life with the power of color in <em>Colorbound</em>, a vibrant palette-platformer. Join Anku on a heartfelt journey to reunite his late grandfather’s band by using color to shape the world around you. As you journey, you’ll solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and help a family of musicians come together one last time.</li><li><strong>A Farewell Tour For Your Grandfather</strong> – Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician to his people, but his band has long since scattered. Now, with only memories and a special gift, Anku must journey across diverse landscapes to find the missing musicians, reignite their passions, and give his grandfather the farewell he deserves. Along the way, you’ll use color to brighten the canvas, turning obstacles into opportunities, and puzzles into music!</li><li><strong>Change Colors to Change The World</strong> – In <em>Colorbound</em>, you will collect colors onto your palette, which can be used to overcome logic and light platforming puzzles. From lush forests to forgotten cities, <em>Colorbound</em>‘s overworld offers a variety of mind-bending puzzles that span a variety of locations and aesthetics.</li><li><strong>Finding Balance</strong> – Not all colors behave the same way. Some may be lighter, allowing objects to float away once painted, while other colors are heavier and may drop down. Using this to your advantage can help Anku cross the treacherous terrain to reach his destination.</li><li><strong>Rooted in Culture</strong> – <em>Colorbound</em> draws inspiration from the Aymara culture of the Andes, blending traditional music and art styles with an indie-gem-inspired puzzle platformer experience. Informed by Panpipe Studio’s Chilean culture and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> celebrates the rich culture of South America while delivering a universal story of love, loss, and the power of art.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
