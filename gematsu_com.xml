      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > ENDLESS Legend II [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/endless-legend-ii">ENDLESS Legend II</a></em> will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3407390/ENDLESS_Legend_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> this summer, publisher <a title="Companies > Hooded Horse [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hooded-horse">Hooded Horse</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Amplitude Studios [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amplitude-studios">Amplitude Studios</a> announced. <span id="more-957466"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3407390/ENDLESS_Legend_2/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>ENDLESS Legend II</em> is a fantasy <a title="Genres > Strategy [233 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy game</a> where you lead wildly varied factions as they build grand empires and wage planet-spanning wars on an ever-evolving ocean world at the brink of extinction. Cataclysmic events have wrought havoc on the natural order, and the very world will change as time goes on revealing new opportunities for exploration and conquest to the bold and daring. Establish expansive cities to spread your influence and strengthen your economy, raise armies and command troops in turn-based tactical battles to overcome your enemies by force, and push forth into the unknown to uncover the dark secrets that lie at the planet’s core.</p><p><strong>Lead Disparate Factions</strong></p><p>Whether you command righteous warriors descended from the stars or hive-minded aliens that know only how to fight, feed, and propagate, <em>ENDLESS Legend II</em> features vastly different factions each driven by their own philosophies, histories, capabilities, and narratives. Each of the factions have unique traits that set them apart from one another whether on the battlefield, in matters of commerce, with regards to empire-building, or in diplomatic affairs—it is up to you to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses and build strategies and distinct playstyles.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>The choice of faction will influence every aspect of the game. Will you prefer to benefit from a constant state of fighting, untethered by the need to justify your wars, spawning additional warriors with each victorious battle to grow endlessly in strength? Or will you choose to benefit from cohabitation and cooperation, spreading tendrils of influence throughout the world to build a network of allies, leveraging relationships with the minor factions of the planet to further enrich your empire? Learn what makes each faction distinct and use it to your advantage whether you’re leading them, or looking to destroy them.</li><li>Military doctrine varies greatly between the factions, providing unique opportunities for a capable commander to gain an advantage over their foe, even when out of combat. Whether you’re building massive fortifications as the Kin of Sheredyn to defend your cities, establishing connections to powerful weapons and support systems waiting in orbit, or you’re investing in the spread of coral that allows the units of spiritualist Aspects to support themselves outside of friendly territory, know your enemy and know yourself to gain the upper hand in any conflict.</li><li>Either auto-resolve combat or take direct control of individual units within your armies when battle begins, using the surrounding terrain to your advantage as you seek out chokepoints, cover, and the high ground. Apart from having faction-specific units, traits, weapons, and attributes, each faction also features special battlefield abilities that can turn the tide of battle if properly utilized. Where one faction might work best with a patient commander, able to meticulously maneuver troops to secure powerful adjacency bonuses, another might rely on force of numbers and overwhelming strength.</li><li>Recruit heroes and watch them grow over time as they gain new traits to bolster their abilities, build relationships that provide them with various boons, and acquire equipment useful both in and out of battle. Powerful commanders, properly trained and armed, can turn the tide of entire wars when wisely utilized.</li></ul><p><strong>Reign in an Evolving World</strong></p><p>Empires will rise and fall based on their ability to adapt to a changing world. Starting from a single humble city, expand according to your faction’s unique strengths and limitations while adapting to the periodic monsoons and tidefalls. Build districts around your cities’ central structures, exploit strategic and luxury resources littered around the world, and develop your technological capabilities and industrial might.</p><ul><li>Cataclysmic tidefalls will expose new opportunities and threats as the oceans recede to unveil new land ripe for expansion. While your existing territory will remain unscathed, the newly revealed terrain from the retreating oceans will open up new avenues of approach for you and your enemies, alongside new resources to exploit and new anomalies to explore. While this can fundamentally change the strategic value of various locations as time goes on, a wise leader will plan for the inevitable—will you prepare to expand into new lands as soon as a tidefall occurs, or focus on shoring up your defenses where you anticipate new landbridges to appear?</li><li>Plan the development of your cities to focus on population growth, industrialization, and commerce, or prioritize their contribution to the sciences, your empire’s influence, and your military might— the choice is yours based on the needs of your burgeoning empire. Establish districts that provide fortifications or further the production of various resources, take advantage of adjacency and terrain bonuses, and pursue technological advancements that allow you to upgrade established districts or unlock entirely new options. Will you patiently seek out ideal locations to establish long-term economic hubs and military strongholds, or will you spread rapidly to secure new lands and increased productivity ahead of your enemies?</li><li>The lands around you are teeming with both opportunity and danger alike. Crush the weaker minor factions littered around the world to pillage their resources, or instead cultivate friendly relations and have them join your growing empire, incorporating their distinctive units and heroes to further strengthen your people. Explore ancient ruins and strange anomalies, braving the dangers of the unknown to enrich your lands and gain powerful artifacts to wield against your enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Write Your Own Legend</strong></p><p>A deep mystery lies buried beneath the surface of this once-tranquil ocean world, where an ancient power stirs in the darkness. Gain dominion over the planet through violent conquest, seek victory through diplomatic and technological advancements, pursue quests and tackle events that can alter the course of a campaign, or empower your sworn heroes to unveil the story of your people—the choice is yours.</p><p>Will you be a ruthless conqueror or a cunning builder? A cultivated diplomat or a flesh-eating beast? Will you bring harmony back to the planet, seeking out lost legends and heroes, or will you defy the fate that drives your faction and carve a legend of your own?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Gameplay Trailer | Triple I" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ZbcbtTLsxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, explore medieval history on the fringes of China with two new civilizations: the Jurchens and Khitans!</p><p><strong>Five New Civilizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong> – Take the reins of the Kingdom of Shu and fulfil Liu Bei’s dream of restoring the Han dynasty. The Shu unique units are the White Feather Guard, an infantryman that slows down units it attacks, and the War Chariot, a vehicle that fires barrages of bolts from a large repeating crossbow.</li><li><strong>Wei</strong> – Step into the shoes of Cao Cao and dominate China with massive cavalry armies and nefarious schemes. The Wei unique units are the Tiger Cavalry, a horseman that levels up as it kills units, and the Xianbei Raider, a cavalry archer that fires storms of arrows into the enemy ranks.</li><li><strong>Wu</strong> – Lead the Sun Clan to glory through infantry and naval prowess. The Wu unique units are the Fire Archer, a ranged soldier that fires incendiary arrows, and the Jian Swordsman, a heavy infantry unit whose shield offers immense protection – until it breaks.</li><li><strong>Jurchens</strong> – Dominate the rugged terrain of northeast China with the skilled hunters, armored cavalry, and gunpowder weaponry of the Great Jin dynasty.

The Khitan unique units are the Liao Dao, an infantryman whose lethal sword slashes cause lasting damage, and the Mounted Trebuchet, a powerful siege engine carried around by camels. Additionally, instead of farming, the Khitans gather food from Pastures, which can be tended by two Villagers instead of just one.</li></ul><p>“The Three Kingdoms” also brings several new units and unit-lines for increased immersion in Chinese history:</p><ul><li><strong>Hei Guang Cavalry</strong> – Heavily armored horsemen.

It is available now for all platforms, free of charge. <span id="more-957436"></span></p><p>“We have another big surprise for <em>SaGa</em> fans: a collaboration between <em>Vampire Survivors</em> (yes, that <em>Vampire Survivors</em>!) and <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>,” said <em>SaGa</em> series general director Akitoshi Kawazu in a press release. “You may be wondering what could have possibly brought a bullet hell, <a title="Genres > Survival [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelike [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> and <em>SaGa</em> together. This collaboration was realized thanks to Luca from poncle being a fan of the <em>SaGa</em> franchise. I would never have imagined that SaGa would continue to expand in this way, so at the same time as being totally surprised, I feel a new, fresh kind of joy.”</p><p>Kawazu continued, “To the <em>SaGa</em> fans out there who haven’t experienced <em>Vampire Survivors</em> yet: please seize this opportunity to jump in and enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. And I would love for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> fans to try playing <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em> as well. But first, let’s enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em>. I’m going to be playing too—until my fingers hurt!”</p><p><em>SaGa</em> series producer <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>anori Ichikawa added, “Firstly, I’m truly delighted that this day has arrived. Thank you so much to Luca and all the creators at poncle for your love of <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>. I’ll also be diving in and enjoying this collaboration!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3451100/Vampire_Survivors_Emerald_Diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In a universe where a single level up choice can change everything, the <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> characters stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vampire Survivors, united to face their next <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,198 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> together. Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire? We doubt it, but never say never.</p><p>As the Junction opens, the Vampire Survivors are thrust into a strange system of interconnected worlds, from a wondrous enchanted witchdom to a sinister realm of bloody nightmares. Equipped with the power of Glimmers and befriended by those that understand this strange universe better than anyone, onward they step in to the unknown; united in cause, wanting to survive, and bereft of fear. Well maybe a little bit of fear.</p><p><strong>Over 12 New Characters</strong></p><p>An eclectic cast of bizarre <em>SaGa</em> protagonists join the Survivors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido</strong> – A fate-forged master of Kugutsu combat puppets.</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling</strong> – An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie and Formina</strong> – A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms.</li><li><strong>Diva No. 5</strong> – A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds (and robotic bodies) to rediscover her memories.</li><li><strong>And Many More!</strong> – Including a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies…</li></ul><p><strong>Over 16 New Weapons and the Glimmer Mechanic</strong></p><p>40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the <em>SaGa</em> series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there’s a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of<em> SaGa</em> gets represented!</p><ul><li><strong>Fleuret</strong> – Stab enough encroaching enemies and you’ll Glimmer the Crystalline Carve, letting you freeze foes whilst cutting them down.</li><li><strong>Pressure Point</strong> – Unleash a barrage of martial arts blows at close range to Glimmer the far-reaching fire jab Shenlong Firefist.</li><li><strong>Hecaton Machine Gun</strong> – Shoot a blistering salvo of interestingly inaccurate bullets to Glimmer the Bombarding Fire technique, blasting baddies with a massive upheaval of the earth.</li><li><strong>Hyperion Bazooka</strong> – Master these high-power missiles that explode as they penetrate through hordes of foes to Glimmer the Cosmic Rave to massively multiply your firepower.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Parties</strong></p><p>No <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> downloadable content is complete without a squad of odd allies to pal around with. Level up Tsunanori Mido to summon up to four Kugutsu combat puppets, fighting independently with their own weapons in a defensive cross formation. Pick either Bonnie or Formina to play as both intrepid investigators, combining punches and pistols for a powerful partnership. And in the darkness of Yomi, rumours swirl of a Dismal King who can enthral defeated foes to make his own army of allies…</p><p><strong>Showstopper</strong></p><p>Survivors never give up! When a <em>SaGa</em> character reaches critical HP they fight back from the brink with a Showstopper, a brief burst of bonus Might, decreased Cooldown, and a little extra Luck to help them survive whatever precarious situation you’ve put them in with a tempest of powered-up projectiles.</p><p><strong>A New World-Weaving Stage</strong></p><p>Follow the Emerald Wave through a diorama of interwoven worlds, the perfect setting to walk sideways while mowing down masses of unusual monsters and bonkers bosses.</p><p><strong>Remixes of Stupendous <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> Tracks</strong></p><ul><li>“A Fierce Engagement”</li><li>“A Quick Warm-Up”</li><li>“Against All Odds”</li><li>“CCPD, Moving Out!”</li><li>“Darkness Incarnate”</li><li>“Emerald Destinies”</li><li>“Feel The Beat”</li><li>“The World’s Heartbeat”</li><li>“Yumeha, Chipper As Ever!”</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,895 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,904 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,930 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/?snr=1_5_9__205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, iOS, and Android.</p><p>Watch the downloadable content announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>DLC “Emerald Diorama” Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama | Launch Trailer | OUT NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrb7lTnklrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
