Following a band of lone-wolf vampire hunters who unite to fight for the fate of their world, this marks the second console game from the company. This title will be the first released under new brand AmuLit, formed in September 2024, and has already attracted tons of attention from fans around the world.</p><p>More than just another love story—something Voltage Inc. is renowned for—this title offers a dramatic, thought-provoking narrative, breathtaking visuals, and compelling performances, all brought to you by the talented writers, artists, and cast.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Redbell Tree scrapes the sky, standing proudly in the heart of Hemeria, a land of sunlight. In a land ruled by a monarchy for generations, humans lived in peace and tranquility. That is, until the dawn of the day the world was dyed red.</p><p>On that day, vampires laid waste to Hemeria. They preyed on, devoured, and devastated its inhabitants. A great many people would go on to mourn their loved ones, their families and friends, for the rest of their lives. One particular town of Hemeria bore such a tragedy. A single girl was left alone in despair and disgrace. She vowed revenge, and grew into one of Hemeria’s finest vampire hunters.</p><p>And one day, she became a member of the Elpis 7; those who inspired a light of hope in its people.</p><p>One day, she receives a letter from an unknown sender. Upon her arrival to the mansion indicated inside, she finds vampire hunters and a royal knight awaiting her. The hunters assembled receive an order from the monarch.</p><p>They are to form a squad and invade Nyx, the world of vampires. A shiver of anticipation crackles through her at the opportunity she’s been waiting for her whole life. However, this is but the beginning of a game wherein the fate of her world is at stake. Pawns are sent forth, discarded, hidden out of sight…</p><p>And just how many will remain when this all comes to an end?</p><p><strong>■ Main Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Juliet Rose</strong> (name customizable)</p><p>She who hunts for Revenge.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_001.png"></a></figure><p>An elite vampire hunter and member of the Elpis 7. After her brother, her only living relative, was killed by a vampire, she swore revenge and devoted her life to that of a vampire hunter. Rather than let her hatred consume her, she fights with beauty and strength, which has led to her popularity as a savior of the people.</p><p>She is just as formidable off of the battlefield, and when challenged to games by the residents of Hemeria, she isn’t above cheating to get her way.</p><p>The news of the discovery of an entrance to Nyx, the world of the vampires, stokes a flame within her, and she dives head first into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seek revenge.</p><p><strong>Ciaran Lowell</strong> (voiced by Takuya Eguchi)</p><p>He who hunts for Power.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_002.png"></a></figure><p>Even among the elite vampire hunters that make up the Elpis 7, he is lauded as the strongest. There are whispers that he defeated an aristos vampire at the age of ten.</p><p>Preferring solitude and isolation, he rarely mixes with others. However, he thinks favorably of those in pursuit of strength, and will at times cooperate with the heroine. He takes pride in his own strength, honed by his daily training, but he is pragmatic and will not engage in reckless battle.</p><p>When summoned by the kingdom to join the invasion of Nyx, he is the one whose intentions most closely mirror the heroine’s. He is their trump card.</p><p><strong>Garrett Welkin</strong> (voiced by Daisuke Namikaa)</p><p>He who hunts under Order.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_003.png"></a></figure><p>The hero of Hemeria, promoted to Commander of the Royal Order at a young age.</p><p>The reason behind his ascension to Commander at such a young age is due to the large scale vampire assault he faced in his youth. Many of his fellow trainees lost their lives, but he was the sole survivor, saving the lives of many citizens, and hailed as a hero.</p><p>He is the public’s brightest hope against their fear of vampires.</p><p>Although he has a serious and stubborn side, and claims to hate vampire hunters, he appears before the heroine as the commander of the hunt party.</p><p><strong>Asher Thompson</strong> (voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto)</p><p>He who hunts to Live.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_004.png"></a></figure><p>A childhood friend of the heroine, with a bright and gentle personality. After an abrupt disappearance he eventually returns, having made a name for himself as one of the Elpis 7.</p><p>Both of his parents, the Thompsons, serve as both vampire hunters and mentors towards the heroine.</p><p>He’s a ray of sunshine amongst the otherwise dour members of the squad, but unlike the Asher the heroine knew in her youth, there’s an air of mystery about him.</p><p>His sunny disposition is the foundation of the trust between the hunters, with the hope his light will cut through the darkness of Nyx.</p><p><strong>Rhodes Heartfield</strong> (voiced by Kengo Kawanishi)</p><p>He who raids for Pride.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_005.png"></a></figure><p>An elegant and beautiful aristos vampire. An immortal being with a preference for human blood and manipulator of magic.</p><p>Cloaked in the fragrance of flowers, he seduces his victims with his soft smile and sweet words. He conceals his true identity from the heroine, sneaking into the crevices of her heart to compel her to do his bidding.</p><p>Does he wish to prey on humans, or does he despise them? His true intentions are unknown.</p></div><p>Watch the opening movie below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
