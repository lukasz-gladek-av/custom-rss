Strengthen the Main Character’s Abilities with Power-Up Items Called “Artifacts”</strong></p><p>By positioning the main character and supporting characters within a Magic Circle, the supporting characters’ power, known as “<a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>,” flows toward the main character. The main character’s abilities are enhanced by placing and activating magical items called “Artifacts,” which provide various enhancement effects on the spaces where Mana flows.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Use Artifacts to power-up the main character.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By placing the Artifact “Stone Guard” on green space, the main character’s DEF will increase.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Among the Artifacts are “Anywhere Artifacts,” which can be placed on any space, regardless of its type. They are useful as they can be conveniently placed anywhere.</p><p><em>—“Mana Plus” is a useful Artifact that can be placed on any space, regardless of type. It restores Mana when your Mana reaches zero.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Some Spaces Activate an Effect Even without Placing an Artifact</strong></p><p>Some spaces in a Magic Circle activate effects by simply having Mana following through them. These are called “Fixed Spaces.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fixed Spaces have various effects, such as always reviving dead supporting characters when passing through a dungeon gate, or switching the equipped weapon to the one placed on a space while active.</p><p><strong>Customize Skills and Magic with Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles can also enhance the skills and magic assigned to the main character.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>By placing an Artifact on a space marked “Skill Magic 1” in a Magic Circle, you can enhance the skill or magic assigned to that slot.</p><p>Not only can you expand the range and increase the power of your skills, you can also increase their level.</p><p><em>—Double a skill’s level to increase its power and expand its range!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>High-level skills and magic consume a lot of SP, so they can’t be used frequently. In such cases, you can use Artifacts to “lower their level” or “increase their power,” combining them to create various effects. Explore and find the combination that best suits your gameplay style and the dungeon you’re trying to clear.</p><p><strong>“Titles” Further Enhance Artifacts</strong></p><p>Some Artifacts have special effects called “Titles.” These Titles enhance Artifacts further.</p><p><em>—The effects of Titles can be checked by pressing the “<a title="Platforms > Switch [16,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>” button on Artifacts list.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>One notable Title is “Union.” When you place Artifacts with the same “Union” Title next to each other, they will “unite” and share each other’s effects. For example, if you place an Artifact that increases ATK by 1 next to one that increases DEF by 1, both ATK and DEF will increase by 2. “Union” is a powerful Title, as its effects stack with the number of connected “Union” Titles.</p><p><em>—The enhancement effects of “Union” Artifacts can be easily checked.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Many New Artifacts Appear, Including “Wide,” “Twin,” and “Zero”</strong></p><p>“Wide” is a powerful Artifact that doubles the effects of all spaces beyond where it is placed. If “Wide” is placed on a skill or magic space, it will turn the skill or magic into a wide-range (wide) version.</p><p><em>—Here is a look at the same magic before and after the placement of a “Wide” Artifact. After placement, the wall of flames effect has a wider range.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Twin” transforms into the Artifact placed on the next space, granting you twice the power. Additionally, Mana consumption is halved, allowing you to double the strength of powerful Artifacts at half the cost.</p><p><em>—After the placement of a “Twin” artifact next to an Artifact that requires 11 Mana and increases ATK by 3, Mana cost decreases to 5 while ATK now increases by 6.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Zero” is an Artifact that enables the Artifact placed on the next space to activate with zero Mana. If the next space is a Fixed Space, its effect will be nullified.</p><p><em>—With “Zero,” you can use Artifacts that consume a lot of Mana or activate Fixed Spaces with debuff effects without having to worry about the drawbacks.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Enhancement 2. Power-Up By Placing Supporting Characters in Your <a title="Genres > Party [86 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>! They Will Shoulder the Main Character’s Burden!</strong></p><p>Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle act as a shield for the main character, taking damage in their place when attacked. The main character will not take any damage unless the HP of all supporting characters reaches zero.</p><p><em>—Simply place three supporting characters to boost your HP by three characters’ worth and significantly power you up!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, if a supporting character’s HP drops to zero and they are defeated, the Artifact buffs provided by that supporting character will disappear, causing the main character to lose power. To prevent this, consider placing supporting characters with high HP, or position supporting characters with low HP inside a Magic Circle where they are less likely to be attacked.</p><p><em>—When all the supporting characters’ HP reaches zero, the main character can be directly attacked. Be sure to keep an eye on your supporting characters’ HP.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_023.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_024.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>A New Magic Circle that Branches Based on Certain Conditions</strong></p><p>The Ranger Magic Circle “Mermaid” increases resistance to all attacks when in water.It is ideal for clearing dungeons with mostly water-based terrain.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_025.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_026.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Swordsman Magic Circle “Magic Swordsman” is a powerful Magic Circle that automatically activates the skill or magic set in the fourth slot when the skill or magic in the third slot is used, allowing for consecutive skill or magic activation. It is especially useful in boss battles.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_027.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_028.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Saint Magic Circle “Honor” is a highly effective Magic Circle for dungeons with many traps. On floors that are multiples of three (such as the third, sixth, and so on), it grants the “Flying” state, allowing you to bypass all ground traps. It is especially useful in dungeons with multiple floors that are multiples of three.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_030.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to these, there are over 20 types of Magic Circles that each class can learn. There are also special Magic Circles that can be obtained by clearing specific “Magic Maps” (Mapgeons) under certain conditions.</p><p><strong>Develop and Level Up Your Characters in Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles not only enhance characters, they also serve as a party development system. Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle and exploring dungeons with you will gain experience points and level up. By using Magic Circles that allow you to set more supporting characters, you can level up your party more efficiently.</p><p><em>—Somewhere in the world is a hidden Magic Circle that allows the placement of 16 supporting characters…!?</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_031.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are also Artifacts that can boost the stats that increase when a supporting character levels up. By selecting the stats you want to strengthen, you can develop your characters according to your preferences.</p><p><em>—This is a development-focused Artifact that benefits the supporting character who activates it. Use it to develop the strongest possible characters.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_032.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Introductions to Three Out of the 10 Classes</strong></p><p><strong>Ninja</strong></p><p>Toy with enemies using a variety of ninjutsu Magic Circles and fast running.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_033.png"></a></figure><ul><li>If set as the main character, you can walk faster, making them ideal for time attacks.</li><li>Can learn “Dagger” skills and use magic.</li><li>Can learn ninjutsu-related Magic Circles, such as changing appearance while using skills or magic.</li><li>Many of their Magic Circles are designed for a small number of characters, but with plenty of development spaces, they are great for character growth.</li></ul><p><strong>Dragoon</strong></p><p>The best of the best in hand-to-hand combat.
