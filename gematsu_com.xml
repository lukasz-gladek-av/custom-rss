There’s harsh elements and rough terrain to overcome, food to be foraged and mysteries to be uncovered, all the while, Sam is on a journey of making peace with his past and becoming himself.</p><p><em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> is inspired by the Franklin expedition of 1845 (more on that in a sec, if you’re interested) and Inuit legends and can be played solo or <a title="Genres > Co-Op [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly.</p><p>The Franklin expedition set out on a mission to discover a North-West Passage that would connect Europe and Asia in 1845. Their ships, Terror and Erebus, were the best equipped expedition vessels thus far and yet never made it home. The ships and other remainders have only been discovered fairly recently and their disappearance is shrouded in mystery to this day.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The story of Franklin and his crew has been fascinating us long before we started development on <em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> and became our initial inspiration. In the game we’re telling our fictional version of the story through a mystery Sam needs to solve on the island. The Humboldt expedition had been lost and Sam’s crew was tasked to find out what happened when they themselves got into an accident leaving Sam and a single sled dog stranded on the island that happens to be the stage for the final days of the lost Humboldt crew. Sam now has the chance to retrace their steps and uncover a dark secret that led to the expedition’s tragic failure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_946743"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>An Emotional Narrative</strong> – <em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> is a coming-of-age story in which you explore unfamiliar terrain, forage for food and uncover mysteries.
