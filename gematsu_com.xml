      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Pocketpair [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> has announced the establishment of <a title="Companies > Pocketpair Publishing" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pocketpair/pocketpair-publishing">Pocketpair Publishing</a>, a new publishing business that will support game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for independent developers and studios. Its first project will be a new horror title from <em><a title="Games > Tales of Kenzera: ZAU [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera: ZAU</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Surgent Studios [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/surgent-studios">Surgent Studios</a>, scheduled to release in 2025. <span id="more-939923"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>About Pocketpair Publishing</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank">Pocketpair Publishing</a> provides comprehensive support for game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for indie game developers and small studios. Pocketpair Publishing promises to take a hands-off approach, providing as much support as developers need without overstepping or imposing strict conditions on the development process.</p><p><strong>Supporting New Title From Surgent Studios</strong></p><p>Pocketpair Publishing’s first project will be supporting a brand new title from the United Kingdom-based studio Surgent Studios which is scheduled to release later in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Surgent Studios is a studio that has been garnering attention for its original approach to storytelling, founded by renowned British actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim. Pocketpair Publishing has provided the necessary development funding and support so that Surgent Studios’ next title can realize its full potential.</p><p><strong>A Message to Developers From John “Bucky” Buckley, Head of Pocketpair Publishing</strong></p><p>“At Pocketpair, there is nothing we love more than games, and Pocketpair Publishing is our latest venture to help the world enjoy gaming even more. Game development comes with many challenges, but we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.</p><p>“We are pleased to be able to support SURGENT STUDIOS’ new title as our first step. We deeply sympathize with their original ideas and passion and are honored to help them realize their vision. We will respect the autonomy and vision of developers and work together to make great games for people all over the world.</p><p>“We sincerely hope that more creators will be able to realize their dreams through Pocketpair Publishing.”</p><p><strong>A Message From Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios</strong></p><p>“We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a <a title="Genres > Horror [549 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> about it. Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. This game will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say.</p><p>“We’re still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the <em><a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> Kenzera</em> universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we’ve come from and where we’re going.”</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
