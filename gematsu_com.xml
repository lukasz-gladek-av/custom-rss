It will launch digitally this winter as a timed console exclusive. <span id="more-992211"></span></p><p>According to a FAQ on the game’s <a href="https://suikagame.jp/planet/" target="_blank">official website</a>, there are no major differences between the Switch 2 and Switch versions of the game, other than the Switch 2 version supporting GameShare. The FAQ also states that while the game will be digital-only at launch, a physical edition is under consideration for Japan. As for whether the game will be released for “smartphones, game consoles other than Switch, or PC,” plans are “currently undecided.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Aladdin X:</p><blockquote><p>The hit puzzle game returns in outer space. Collide matching fruit to “evolve” them into larger fruit and higher scores. Drop fruit towards the center of the planet to create as many big watermelons (Suika) as possible, and net bonus points by triggering new Super Evolution combos. <em>Suika Game Planet</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 also features an exclusive local four-player cooperative mode with GameShare.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->

Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,545 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz—those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/two-point-museum-for-switch-2-launches-october-28]]></content:encoded>
