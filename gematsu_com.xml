I’m Runhao Yao, producer of the <em>Nikki</em> series. I want to personally thank each of you for your continued support and patience. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that <em>Infinity Nikki</em> will officially release across multiple platforms on December 5—a date that holds special meaning for us. Twelve years ago, on this very day, we released our first game in the beloved <em>Nikki</em> series, <em>Nikki Up2U: A Dressing Story</em>. Now, our fifth <em>Nikki</em> game is finally ready to meet you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The first <em>Nikki</em> game was created by just a few of us, but today, the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> team has grown to more than one thousand people. Bringing this “one-of-a-kind” project to life has been challenging, with far more complexity in development and <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> than we ever anticipated. It’s been tough, but our determination carried us through. Our team has always believed in taking on the impossible, and because this was a <em>Nikki</em> project, we were even more motivated and inspired to pursue “infinity” with everything we had.</p><p>These last 12 years have been a long but precious journey for both the <em>Nikki</em> series and our team. Thank you to everyone who has played Nikki in the past, those who enjoy it now, and those who will join us in the future. If you’re planning to try <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, we hope it brings you joy.</p><p>—Runhao Yao, Producer</p></blockquote><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Infold Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> is the fifth installment in the beloved <em>Nikki</em> series developed by Infold Games. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5, this multi-platform, open-world dress-up adventure seamlessly blends the series’ core dress-up mechanics with open-world exploration elements. It also offers platforming, puzzle-solving, and many other gameplay elements to create a unique and rich experience.</p><p>In this game, Nikki and Momo embark on a new adventure to travel across the fantastical nations of Miraland, each with its own unique culture and environment. Players will encounter many characters and whimsical creatures while collecting stunning outfits of various styles. Some of these outfits possess magical abilities that are crucial for exploration.</p><p><strong>Whimsical Adventure with Endless Fun</strong></p><p>Harnessing the power of Whim that’s hidden within outfits, Nikki has the tools to help her overcome difficult trials. Her courage and determination know no bounds.</p><p>The Floating Outfit allows Nikki to hover gracefully, the Gliding Outfit summons a giant flower for high-altitude flights, and the Shrinking Outfit lets her sit on Momo’s head as he navigates through small spaces. These Ability Outfits open up many possibilities for adventure and thus offer an endless amount of fun!</p><p>In this vast, fantastical world, master techniques such as floating, running, and plunging to freely explore the land as well as tackle cleverly designed puzzles and levels. The joy of 3D platforming is interwoven throughout the game’s open-world exploration. Each unique scenery is vibrant and charming. Soaring paper cranes, speeding wine cellar minecarts, mysterious ghost trains—new mysteries are waiting to be unraveled!</p><p><strong>Wonderful Moments with Endless Immersion</strong></p><p>Miraland is also a fantastic place for you to relax and appreciate life.</p><p>With sunrises, sunsets, and the ever-changing weather, the creatures of Miraland have their own lives. Remember their daily routines and try to find them! Wear outfits with special abilities to fish by the river or catch bugs with a net. The game features an in-depth gathering system where the items Nikki collects become great clothing materials.</p><p>Stroll through flower fields and meadows, walk along mountain streams, and encounter merchants offering special outfits. Let your inspiration rise with the paper cranes on the streets. Use Momo’s Camera and dress Nikki up in your favorite outfits. You can choose the perfect backgrounds and frames to take pictures of her, capturing every heartwarming moment of your journey anytime, anywhere.</p><p><strong>It’s Glam Time Any Time!</strong></p><p>Thank you for being interested in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. We look forward to meeting you in Miraland!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer and interview with theme song singer Jessie J below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4dbzntYMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="インフィニティニキ グローバルリリース決定 記念PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyt8yKhZyC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《無限暖暖》全球公測定檔12月5日！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6DLW7obwIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Theme Song: “Together Till Infinity” Interview with Jessie J</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Infinity Nikki Theme Song Together Till Infinity | Exclusive Interview with Jessie J" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaWNdwimZHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="インフィニティニキテーマソング「Together Till Infinity」歌手Jessie Jスペシャルインタビュー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH3FANSECEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="《無限暖暖》主題曲《Together Till Infinity》－歌手Jessie J特別訪談公開！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7-8wTjBxz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
