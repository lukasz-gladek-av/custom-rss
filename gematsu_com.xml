Unlike hardcore tactical shooters, the game features cartoonish enemies, fog-of-war mechanics, and randomly dropped loot. Set in a mysterious egg-shaped world that’s slowly falling apart, players customize their own duck and set out to escape the planet by crafting a rocket ship. Combined with base-building, weapon customization, and in-depth progression systems, it offers high replayability that will keep players coming back for more.﻿</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/escape-from-duckov-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>
