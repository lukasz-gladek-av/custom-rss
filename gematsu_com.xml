        <p>Monstrous creatures known as “GEMs” begin attacking people, and at the same time the academy city is sealed off by a mysterious “bubble,” leaving no means of escape to the outside.</p><p>In this closed and desperate situation, each person is forced to confront the “karma” they bear.</p><p>What is the truth behind the strange phenomenon surrounding the academy city—?</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Protagonist</strong> (voiced by Kengo Kawanishi)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 17 (skipped a grade)</li><li>6th year student at Adhvan Resilience Academy School of Science and Engineering in the Life Sciences Department</li><li>Member of the basketball team</li></ul><p>A talented young man who skipped a grade after enrolling in the academy. He is part of the same Mano Dormitory as his friends, and is Marika’s cousin and Sushiro’s best friend. In order to catch the culprit behind a certain event, he and his friends form the team “ADHVAN REBS.”</p><p><strong>Sushiro</strong> (voiced by Shunsuke Takeuchi)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 19 (enrolled one year late, and repeated a year)</li><li>5th year student at Adhvan Resilience Academy School of Science and Engineering in the Life Sciences Department</li><li>Member of the basketball team</li></ul><p>A cheerful and kind older brother-type. He is the captain of the basketball team and is very protective of the younger students, though his overprotective nature sometimes annoys his friends. He and the protagonist are best friends—almost like brothers.</p><p><strong>Anastasia</strong> (voiced by Aimi)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 18</li><li>6th year student at Adhvan Resilience Academy School of Science and Engineering in the Life Sciences Department</li><li>Member of the cosplay club</li></ul><p>A cosplayer who loves anime and has a ton of followers on social media. She is astute and has a good intuition, but can sometimes be a bit lazy. While usually guarded and cold, she becomes more compassionate and physically affectionate once she gets to know you. She can also be stubborn and superstitious.</p><p><strong>Oliver</strong> (voiced by Atsushi Tamaru)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 15</li><li>4th year student at Adhvan Resilience Academy School of Science and Engineering in the Life Sciences Department.</li><li>Member of the debate team</li></ul><p>A sarcastic and socially unpopular person. While he is constantly at the top of his class and regularly wins debate competitions, he tends to ridicule others and is disliked in his private life. Within the group, Sushiro often teases him, but he always coldly brushes him off.</p><p><strong>Chloe</strong> (voiced by Asami Shimoda)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 14</li><li>3rd year student at Adhvan Resilience Academy School of Science and Engineering in the Life Sciences Department</li></ul><p>A pure girl who grew up in a naturally rich environment and loves animals and mother nature. In the past, she has been suspended from school for refusing to participate in experiments involving animals. While she has a photographic memory and is a strong student, she is not good at socializing. Only around her friends does she drop her guard and act slightly more relaxed.</p><p><strong>Marika</strong> (voiced by Aoi Nagatsuki)</p><ul><li><strong>Age:</strong> 13</li><li>1st year student at Adhvan Resilience</li><li>Member of the occult research club</li></ul><p>The protagonist’s cousin, who grew up with him like a younger sister. She is restless and energetic, and plays the role of the mood maker who lightens the mood among the group. Though she actually has asthma and is worried about her health.</p><p><strong>■ Systems</strong></p><p><strong>Sankhara Spacetime</strong></p><p>The Sankhara Spacetime is a dungeon-esque alternate dimension that embodies the “ten evil deeds” of humanity. When people at the academy mutate into GEMs, they create a Sankhara Spacetime that stands in the way of the protagonist and company in their pursuit of the “truth.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_037.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_039.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Battle</strong></p><p>The battle system is a fusion of real-time “speed <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>” and a multitude of tactics. Players must utilize cooperation between the protagonist and his companions, as well as powerful special moves, to take on formidable foes. Assess the rapidly changing state of battle, quickly select skills, and gain the upper hand.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_026.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_027.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Genome Arms</strong></p><p>“Genome Arms” are mutated arms that transform into weapons. By changing equipped skills, players can adopt a variety of combat styles. Additionally, the protagonist’s Genome Arms can be switched during battle—by considering enemy affinities and coordination with companions, players can gain a strategic advantage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_028.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_029.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Wall Slide</strong></p><p>When you approach a wall, a wall slide will begin, allowing you to quickly move along the wall to the opposite side of the field. Outside of swift movement, it can also be used to launch a surprise “raid attack” on enemies from above. Raid attacks make it easier to fight off enemies, allowing you to aim for a quick victory.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Warning Signal</strong></p><p>When an enemy is about to attack, a warning signal will shine. By swapping Genome Arms at the right moment in response to the signal, you can parry the enemy’s attack. This prevents damage and enables a strong “deflect counter” right after. There are also counters that can be used by successfully dodging at the right moment, and counters that allow you to blow back after being sent flying by the enemy’s attack. <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter these various counters to respond to the enemy’s attack in any situation.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_034.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editions</strong></p><p><strong>Standard Edition</strong> (8,580 yen on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>; 9,680 yen on <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li></ul><p><strong>Special Edition</strong> (17,380 yen on PlayStation 5 and Switch; 18,480 yen on Switch 2)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_044.jpg"></a></figure><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Visual art book</li><li>Digipack soundtrack CD</li><li>Wide-color-gamut art prints (x2)</li><li>Lottery ticket application card for an extra large (727mm x 606mm) canvas board (10 winners will be selected)</li></ul><p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition</strong> (10,780 yen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch; 11,880 yen on Switch 2)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Digital visual book</li></ul></div><p><em>Villion: Code</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, and Switch on May 25 in Japan.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

With a vibrant aesthetic that aims to recreate the richness and dynamism of hand-drawn Japanese animation, <em>Homura Hime</em> tasks players with ridding the world of the fiendish Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, utilizing slick melee combat evocative of the <em><a title="Series > NieR [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/nier">NieR</a></em> and <em>Devil May Cry</em> series. Dodge the barrages of enemy attacks and string together flashy combos to clear the battlefield, excising tainted souls from a troubled world and unraveling the mysterious legacy of the titular heroine.</p><p>Welcome to a world populated by both humans and demons. Here, troubled souls burdened by intense emotion or deep regret are transformed into archdemons when they pass through the veil of mortality. These archdemons have the power to corrupt the very foundation of the world, contaminating their surroundings and the creatures who dwell within them. Those tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters; vicious fiends that operate solely on raw instinct. When this world becomes threatened by a quintet of extremely powerful Archdemon Girls, the High Priestess has no other choice but to turn to Homura Hime, the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist. Alongside her devoted aide Ann, Homura Hime must embark on a divine mission to eliminate the five Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, banishing their evil and purifying her discordant world.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022093"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
