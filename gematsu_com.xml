Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But <em>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</em> also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.</li><li><strong><em><a title="Games > Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em></strong> (PS5) – Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer <a title="Genres > Co-Op [224 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play in this genre-defying, <a title="Genres > Action [2,394 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [1,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,264 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">third-person shooter</a> from <a title="Companies > Rocksteady Studios [128 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games/rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady Studios</a>, creators of the critically acclaimed <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series. Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive <a title="Genres > Open-World [541 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> city of Metropolis, the game puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect. All the while, the Suicide Squad must be mindful of the lethal explosives implanted in their heads that could go off at the first sign of defiance. Each squad member has their own unique moveset with enhanced traversal abilities to freely explore the dynamic open-world of Metropolis, along with a variety of weapons to customize, and skills to master.</li></ul></blockquote></div>
