There are no blocks to slice or balls to smash, and you don’t need to flail your arms like an octopus in a mosh pit. While other games ask you to zone out and follow along to a pre-set beat, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you wield the most majestic of brass instruments—the trombone, and lets you take control of the music itself. You’re not just reacting to a song like a musical lemming—you’re performing it. Every note, slide, and toot is yours to control, letting you decide whether to stick with the melody or go rogue in Improv Mode with a jazz solo wild enough to have your music teacher reaching for the tissues.</p><p><strong>Campaign Promises</strong></p><p>Our all-new Campaign Mode offers an epic journey packed with surprises for beginners and <em><a title="Games > Trombone Champ [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a></em> veterans alike. It eases you in, letting you get comfortable with the instrument’s quirks and rhythm. But don’t get too cozy. The campaign ramps up faster than a trombone glissando, introducing complex tracks and challenges that push your rhythm, timing, and ability to adapt. Every milestone you reach unlocks new tracks, and you’ll leave your mark on the leaderboards as you compete for the illustrious title of the one true <em>Trombone Champ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hornucopia</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest. One trombone just isn’t enough. How many is too many? We’re not sure yet, but we’re definitely going to find out. At launch, you’ll have over 20 trombones to unlock, each with its own sound, style, and… personality. From a purrfect cat trombone that meows as you play to a ridiculously floppy pool noodle that bends with every slide or even a melting ice cream cone, each trombone has a unique look, sound, and feel. And with dozens more unlockable trombones rolling out in the coming weeks and months, there will always be a new piece of brass to chase after.</p><p>As if that weren’t enough for you relentless collectors, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> also offers a full set of collectible Tromboner Cards. Yes, they’re called Tromboner Cards, and yes, they’re exactly as ridiculous as they sound. With 50 individual cards packed with absurd trombone trivia and mysterious lore, these cards are truly another thing to unlock and collect. Think you’ve got what it takes to snag them all? Just don’t lose your grip on the slide (or your grip on reality) along the way.</p><p><strong>Make It Make Sense</strong></p><p>Thanks to the advanced haptics and adaptive triggers of the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you feel each note as you play. Whether you’re executing a delicate note or unleashing a full blast, the tactile feedback makes each musical moment feel impactful. Plus, with the game running at a smooth 120 hertz on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and delivering crisp, vibrant visuals in 4K HDR, every toot and slide looks as impressive as it feels. The dynamic environments and audience reactions adjust to your playing, adding an extra layer of immersion to every performance as you bring the music to life.</p><p><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></p><p>As our debut PlayStation VR2 adaptation, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em>, kicks off Flat2VR Studios’ mission to take the classics and give them new life in VR. This is just the beginning for us—we have more in the pipeline, each reimagined to fully leverage the immersive power of VR. We’re thrilled to have PlayStation players join us on this journey as we work to push PlayStation VR2 gaming to new heights.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened! - Announce | PS VR2 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwmnT8t_3Gw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
