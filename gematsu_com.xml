    <p><span>Currently in closed beta.</span>

A full release is planned across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-994724"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Closed Beta</strong></p><p>We’re two weeks into <em>2XKO</em> closed beta, and the response from the community has been amazing. We’ve seen lots of love for our newest champions, Vi and Blitzcrank, as well as a ton of community tournaments popping up all over the world. Shoutout to all the grassroots tournament organizers who are making those happen. The closed beta was our first time rolling out our online systems at a large scale, and our team has been tuning matchmaking, fixing bugs, and making sure everything’s working correctly. So far, everything’s been holding up pretty well, so we’re ready to talk about what comes next for the game.</p><p><strong>Early Access</strong></p><p>The closed beta ends on October 7, and <em>2XKO</em> Early Access kicks off the same day. This is when we’re rolling out our very first full-feature version of the game, including a full season of content and a few new features like combo trials.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We’ll be using this time to dial in our Battle Pass and Ranked systems, and to do some balance tuning. Starting in Early Access, there won’t be any more content resets. That means anything you unlock after October 7 is yours to keep.</p><p><strong>Seasons</strong></p><p>Early Access will also be our very first season: Season 0. 2026 will be made up of five seasons, and each season will come with a new champ, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. That means that our tenth champ will be dropping when Early Access hits live on October 7. Keep an eye out for their gameplay reveal trailer and dev update soon.</p><p><strong>Community Tournaments</strong></p><p>We’re also working on how Riot will support the <em>2XKO</em> competitive scene. Our goal is to put the spotlight on community TOs and organizations, so we’ll be sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments through the rest of 2025. We’re calling this the First Impact program. </p><p>Each First Impact event will receive a pot bonus from Riot, with an extra prize for winning as a duo. You can read more about it in our announcement article, which also lists all 22 sponsored events.</p><p>First Impact kicks off with Evo France. Come check out our booth October 10-12 and run some sets with us.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new developer update below.</p><h2><span>Developer Update: Early Access</span></h2><p><iframe title="2XKO Early Access Announcement | Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_ge1A4vZ-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/2xko-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-on-october-7]]></content:encoded>
