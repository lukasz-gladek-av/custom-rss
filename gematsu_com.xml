The port allows players to guide the politics and people of New London with the palms of their hands, on controller and thumbsticks alike.</p><p>Several improvements help tailor the control scheme for gamepads and provide quick access to vital <a title="Genres > Action [2,888 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Players can use bumper buttons to cycle between districts of the same type, or a dynamic radial menu that appears over resource piles and presents actions specific to them. Additionally, following the console release, the PC version of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> will receive an update enabling players to use this new UI scheme whenever a gamepad is connected.</p></blockquote><p>“Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible [from PC to console],” said <em>Frostpunk 2</em> production coordinator Igor Skibinski in a press release. “But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless—so players never have to think about how to play while they’re playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex <a title="Genres > Strategy [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

More than 150 previews were published this week from journalists and content creators and their response was universally positive. We’re blushing about quotes like “nailbiting survival <a title="Genres > Horror [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>,” “absolute blast,” “project with a soul,” and being called a “standout game of 2025.” It proved the gut feeling that we had already—we’re making a very special, fun game.</p><p>It also proved that the <em>Dying Light</em> community is the best. The preview coverage has been viewed by millions of players who looked at every detail of the game with laser focus eyes, highlighting, discussing and getting excited about thousands of details. We’re spending time effortlessly, reading and collecting your feedback and opinions and making sure that your voice is heard and we know exactly what’s important for you.</p><p>It has always been our goal to make <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> the best <em>Dying Light</em> game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</p><p>We’ll keep you busy this summer with regular updates from the studio and a playable demo at Gamescom in Hall 6. Starting next week, we’ll also share an update on the game’s gore and you’ll meet our good friend Bober the Beaver again.</p><p>We’re almost there so please bear with us for the remaining eight weeks—we can’t wait until you finally unleash the Beast on September 19.</p><p>With the best regards from the entire team at Techland,<br>The Developers of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-to-september-19]]></content:encoded>
