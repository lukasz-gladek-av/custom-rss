      </p></div><div><p>Publisher THQ NOrdic and developer <a title="Companies > Quantumfrog" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/quantumfrog">Quantumfrog</a> have announced 3D puzzle <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,739 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Pumuckl and the Crown of the Pirate King" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pumuckl-and-the-crown-of-the-pirate-king">Pumuckl and the Crown of the Pirate King</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,036 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,919 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3864960/Pumuckl_und_die_Krone_des_Piratenknigs/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in early 2026 for $39.99 / €39.99. <span id="more-1010598"></span></p><p>Pumuckl is the red-haired “kobold” from the German children’s series <em>Meister Eder und sein Pumuckl</em>, which began in 1961. It recently had a successful return to television with the series <em>Neue Geschichten vom Pumuckl</em>, as well as a feature film with <em>Pumuckl and the Big Misunderstanding</em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via <a title="Companies > THQ Nordic [547 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic">THQ Nordic</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The famous German kobold Pumuckl is back with a 3D puzzle adventure game <em>Pumuckl and the Crown of the Pirate King</em>. The player controls Pumuckl through 3D puzzle levels, plays mini-games, solves tricky challenges and has to defeat scary enemies.</p><p>There’s always a lot going on in <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Eder’s workshop—especially when the kobold Pumuckl has to tidy up. But while tidying up, he finds a strange bottle, a ship in a bottle, and something is moving inside! With nerve-racking curiosity, Pumuckl opens the bottle containing the ship. Before he can shout “Darn bottle thing!”, the kobold is sucked into a magical vortex—directly onto the ship inside the bottle!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>He wakes up in a magical pirate world that is bigger than it could possibly fit inside any bottle.</p><p>Here he meets the quirky and forgetful Captain Krimskrams, who asks Pumuckl for help: the Pirate King has cursed the ship and hides behind a magical door. Only the golden doubloons can open the door so that Pumuckl and Captain Krimskrams can face the king and have him lift the curse.</p><p>In the pirate world, travel is possible through a magical structure with doors to other worlds: tropical islands, enchanted ruins and an ancient pirate castle. Tricky puzzles, skeleton pirates, kobold traps and mini-games await Pumuckl and Captain Krimskrams everywhere. They are accompanied by the cheeky parrot Krakula, who gives helpful tips—or is amused by their misadventures.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Puzzle Level</strong> – Pumuckl moves through isometric 3D levels.</li><li><strong>Mini-Games</strong> – Memory, collecting quests and tricky challenges.</li><li><strong>Couch Cooperative Play</strong>&nbsp;– Second player can help out as Capt’n Krimskrams (locally).</li><li><strong>Parrot Clues</strong> – Krakula gives clues or makes fun of Pumuckl’s misfortunes.</li><li><strong>Enemies</strong> – Ghosts and skeletons.</li><li><strong>Final Boss Fight</strong> – The Pirate King with multiple phases—puzzle, combat, reaction..</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
