Players will need to be resourceful as they craft and assemble various “Karakuri” (automaton) to shape the hunting ground accordingly and arm themselves with powerful weapons in order to destroy these massive monsters. Upon completing the demo, players will be able to carry over their save data to the full game to continue the hunt.</p></blockquote><p><em>WILD HEARTS S</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on July 25.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/wild-hearts-s-demo-now-available]]></content:encoded>
