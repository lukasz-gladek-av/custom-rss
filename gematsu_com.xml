      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,760 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a> has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/news/this-is-battlefield-labs" target="_blank">announced</a> <em>Battlefield</em> Labs, a new initiative to collaborate with the community, allowing players to test concepts of future <em>Battlefield</em> experiences and provide valuable feedback. Sign-ups are available <a href="https://ea.arcsivr.com/Portal/Default?as-refcode=7718" target="_blank">here</a>. <span id="more-941843"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the initiative, via Electronic Arts:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is <em>Battlefield</em> Labs?</strong></p><p><em>Battlefield</em> Labs is a place for us to test concepts and experiences we’re excited about with you, our players. We want our community to play a key role in the future of <em>Battlefield</em> and this is an opportunity for many of you to do just that.</p><p>We will test (almost) everything but not everything you see will be complete. To ensure that your feedback has impact, players will experience, under NDA, different pieces of an unfinished puzzle so we have time to incorporate your feedback into the final product. </p><p>Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at. We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This is an unprecedented moment for <em>Battlefield</em>. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play. </p><p>And yes, we will be testing Conquest and Breakthrough, the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience, but BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve <em>Battlefield</em> pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play.</p><p><strong>How Do I Get Involved?</strong></p><p><a href="https://ea.arcsivr.com/Portal/Default?as-refcode=7718" target="_blank">Sign up now</a>. To form an accurate snapshot of our community we need a variety of players – veterans and new recruits – ready to play and feedback on our vision for the future of <em>Battlefield</em>. Initial invites will be limited to a few thousand participants with servers located in Europe and North America. Over time we’ll invite tens of thousands more with support for further territories.</p><p>Regardless of your level of participation, we want all <em>Battlefield</em> fans to be a part of the process. We’ll be posting work-in-progress public updates from our community team where you will hear directly from developers at <em>Battlefield</em> Studios.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank"><em>battlefield</em>.com/labs</a> for more information on how you can sign-up.</p><p>There will be ample opportunity to play and converse around the next <em>Battlefield</em> ahead of its launch. This is just the beginning.</p><p>Until then, join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/battlefield" target="_blank">official <em>Battlefield</em> Discord</a> as it’s our prime way to stay up to date on all things <em>Battlefield</em>!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the initiative announcement video below.</p><h2><span><em>Battlefield</em> Labs Announce Video</span></h2><p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
