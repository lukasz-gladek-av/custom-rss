    <p><span>New footage ahead of Taipei Game Show 2025.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gust [800 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a> have released a new trailer, information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a></em> introducing the game’s systems. Plus, 15 minutes of new gameplay was showcased during the Taipei Game Show 2025 Special Program for the game. <span id="more-939549"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In the latest entry of the <em>Atelier</em> franchise, players can freely explore the Aladiss continent by discovering ruins, uncovering hidden treasures, and encountering brand-new characters. A newly unveiled overview trailer gives fans a deeper look at the game system, while a brand-new key visual by Benitama has also been released to the public to help celebrate the upcoming game.</p><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the adventures of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off on a journey to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. In her quest, Yumia will be assisted by Flammi, a flying, self-confident traveling companion who once belonged to her mother. Yumia will also encounter many different characters throughout her travels including Licht, a highly skilled informant; Wilma, an anthropologist with a passion for the culture of Aladiss; Erhard, the leader of the Research Team; and the Alber, a small and friendly tribe who live in various parts of the world.</p><p>Throughout Yumia’s adventures, players will explore dungeons and ruins in search of hidden treasures including “memory vials” – remnants of the past that will allow them to consult certain information on the field such as the location of relic treasure around them. “Memory vials” can also be dismantled to obtain rare materials which are useful for synthesis.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_939581"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>By using the treasure trove keys found during their journey, players will be able to access precious treasures. They can find “trait crystals,” which can be used on items or equipment to improve performance from treasure chests. As they venture into Aladiss, fans will also find “mana geysers” which will release “particles” needed to unlock new synthesis recipes.</p><p>In <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em>, exploration will not be without its dangers, however, as players will sometimes have to venture into “manabound areas” where highly dense mana lies stagnant. Entering these areas will gradually deplete players’ energy, making it impossible to run while also reducing abilities in battle. Players will be able to restore their health by finding Alstahlia Flowers, while discovering and restoring landmarks will clear the area and improve ease of exploration.</p><p>While progressing through the story, players will receive exclusive quests from their travelling companions, but will also be able to gain rewards by completing normal quests. Discovering and unlocking landmarks and Shrines of Prayers during exploration will grant them with location quests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,685 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,590 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,713 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

A cold, almost heartless beauty, she always says what’s on her mind, even if it means offending others. She’s just as merciless on the battlefield, where she gets a twisted sense of pleasure from tearing invaders apart.</li><li><strong>Tsubasa Kawana</strong> (voiced by Ayane Sakura) – A girl who knows a lot about machines and what makes them tick. She had a bright, lively personality, but isn’t good with stressful situations. When she gets nervous, she gets nauseous, and then…</li><li><strong>Gaku Maruko</strong> (voiced by Kensho Ono) – A guy who’s true to his personal desires (to put it delicately). He’s a coward and always looking out for himself. However, there’s something so refreshingly honest about his pettiness that it’s hard to hate him. Gaku’s also good at taking care of other people once he opens his heart to them.</li><li><strong>Kyoshika Magadori</strong> (voiced by Marina Inoue) – A young samurai who’s utterly clueless about the modern world. Has never even heard of multiplication tables, let alone learned them. She has a disturbingly close relationship with her katana, the Holy Jumonji Sword.</li><li><strong>Yugamu Omokage</strong> (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) – A boy who’s been in the business of killing since long before the war started. Unlike the rest of his family (who are also assassins, by the way), Yugamu believes that killing should be done with love. He enjoys torture and other immoral forms of pleasure.</li><li><strong>SIREI</strong> (voiced by Otsuka Hochu) – The principal and commanding officer of Last Defense Academy. To put it another way, a weird little robot that orders the members of the Special Defense Unit around. Under his command, Takumi and the others will be working to wipe out the mysterious School Invaders.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 24 worldwide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
