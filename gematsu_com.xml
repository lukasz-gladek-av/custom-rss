Find a way to communicate with the Mothman via electromagnetic radiation, but don’t linger. Whatever’s out there is tracking you, too.</p><p>Wander through wooded forests, dank caves, mysterious shrines, sealed catacombs, haunted churches, cult lairs, abandoned military outposts, and other handcrafted environments on a hunt for the world’s most fabled creatures of the night. Discover clues from bloody notes, obscurely placed skeletons, and other oddities to combine wit and intuition and outsmart otherworldly dangers.</p><p>Learn what brought each creature into this world and find a way to contain it before it takes any more lives. Take these lessons and apply them to shorter Contract Hunts to tackle randomized locations and puzzles, and earn rewards for living to unlock new gear, traps, and other helpful equipment to personalize your own hunting techniques.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Folklore Hunter - 1.0 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMFv7KvgPqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/folklore-hunter-launches-january-30-2026-for-pc-later-in-2026-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch]]></content:encoded>
