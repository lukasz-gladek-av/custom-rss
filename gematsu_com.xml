Explore the natural landscapes of Colorado and Texas, alone or in a group, and hunt numerous animal species with the help of your faithful hunting dog.</p><p>With almost 10 years’ expertise in hunting games, developer NACON Studio Ghent intends to offer fans of the genre an authentic hunting experience with this third opus. Thanks to feedback from the community, which numbered over one million players on the two previous titles, NACON Studio Ghent has retained the foundations that have made the series such a success, while introducing a number of new features and gameplay improvements. Among these, <em>Hunting Simulator 3</em> introduces an all-new dynamic system, “SimFauna,” which faithfully reproduces animal behavior, allowing players’ actions to have a real impact on animals and the environment.</p><p>In addition to improved hunting dog behavior and sound design, and the addition of vehicles, the game features realistic, natural open-world environments thanks to Unreal Engine 5. Players can hunt over 40 species of animal, using hunting equipment from renowned brands such as Beretta, Winchester, Browning, and many others.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
