It will support English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese language options. <span id="more-1010933"></span></p><p><em>Yokai Landlord: Monster Mystery!</em> first launched in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3193560/Yokai_Landlord_Monster_Mystery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 25, followed by a full release on April 15.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A Werewolf game-style social deduction adventure where you play as the landlord of an apartment and try to uncover the Yokai hiding among your residents. Not just a mystery adventure, this is a heart-warming tale of character growth.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After your father’s passing, you inherit the apartment he left behind.</p><p>Then one day, a mysterious man appears with a warning for you—the new landlord:</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>From that moment on, your journey to uncover the cleverly disguised Yokai begins.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>A social deduction adventure where monsters wear human faces.</p><p>This is a social deduction adventure game where you, as the landlord, must uncover Yokai who are blending in among your apartment’s tenants by gathering clues and presenting evidence.</p><p>The game is a single narrative divided into multiple chapters. As you progress, the seasons change, and new tenants—including more Yokai—move in to replace those who were evicted.</p><p>In each chapter, you’ll need to identify the Yokai in disguise, gather convincing evidence, and evict them.</p><p>The overarching goal of the game is to uncover why Yokai are infiltrating your apartment—and what motives lie behind the warnings of the mysterious man who appeared before you.</p><p><strong>Gather Information From Tenants</strong></p><p>Talk to your tenants—they’ll come to you, the new landlord, with complaints, requests, or simply to chat.</p><p>These conversations may contain clues that help you identify the Yokai among them. If something sounds off or strange, that might be a hint. Be sure to take notes.</p><p>Use the apartment’s security cameras (Available from Chapter Two)</p><p>Yokai are clever. Even with surveillance cameras, they won’t reveal themselves easily.</p><p>But if you’re observant, you might catch them doing something not quite human—when they think no one’s watching.</p><p>Even behavior that seems ordinary at first might hold hidden meaning. Keep your eyes open and leave no clue unexplored.</p><p><strong>Evict the Yokai Once Discovered</strong></p><p>After gathering enough evidence and identifying a tenant as a Yokai, you can proceed with their eviction.</p><p>However, simply pointing out the suspicious tenant won’t be enough to make them leave.</p><p>You must present evidence—such as proof that the other tenants are human—to convince the Yokai to reveal their true identity.</p><p>Be cautious: if you wrongly evict a human tenant, the remaining residents will become even more suspicious of one another—exactly what the yokai want.</p><p>Interview tenants carefully, uncover subtle “suspicious,” and connect the dots to build your case.</p><p>When you finally corner a yokai after rounds of deduction, you’ll experience a unique sense of accomplishment that only this game can deliver.</p><p><strong>If You Don’t Evict Them in Time…</strong></p><p>On the night of the new <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>, the Yokai will unleash their true power.</p><p>When that happens, there’s nothing us powerless humans can do.</p><p><strong>Estimated Total Playtime</strong></p><p>About 10 hours.</p><p>If you’re new to “mystery games,” it may take longer.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/yokai-landlord-monster-mystery-for-switch-launches-december-25]]></content:encoded>

        <p><em>POSTAL: Bullet Paradise</em> throws the Dude straight into the Shitty Future, a world where every robot, psycho, mutant, and corporate goon wants you very, very dead. Good news: you don’t care. Even better news: there’s plenty of junk lying around that can be turned into guns, bombs, or whatever else makes things explode.</p><p>This is a bullet-heaven <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> with online cooperative play, an arsenal of improvised weapons, and more psychos than the Dude has unpaid parking tickets. Pick your favorite Dude from across the <em>POSTAL</em> multiverse and carve your way through waves of chaos, upgrades, and stupidly dangerous power fantasy moments.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Play as Multiple Dudes</strong> – Choose from iconic versions of the POSTAL Dude from across the entire series. Each one has unique stats, perks, and attitude problems.</li><li><strong>Online Cooperative Carnage</strong> – Team up with friends (or other unstable strangers) to survive the endless storm of enemies. Revive each other, stack builds, and ruin the future together.</li><li><strong>Bullet-Heaven Gameplay</strong> – Hundreds of enemies on screen. Thousands of projectiles. Zero shame. Movement and build choices matter… mostly because everything is trying to erase you.</li><li><strong>DIY Arsenal</strong> – Trash becomes firepower. Upgrade weird weapons, stack absurd modifiers, and turn broken scraps into overpowered monstrosities.</li><li><strong>The Shitty Future</strong> – A dystopian world filled with psycho, corporate cultists, malfunctioning robots, and way too much surveillance. If it moves, it probably wants to kill you.</li><li><strong>Progression That Actually Feels Good</strong> – Unlock new Dudes and other well-known <em>POSTAL</em> characters, weapons, abilities, and synergies as you survive longer. Die horribly, come back stronger.</li><li><strong>Multiverse Flavor</strong> – <em>POSTAL 1</em>, <em>2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4,</em> <em>Brain Damaged</em>… they’re all here. Easter eggs, references, and familiar faces for fans who know the chaos by heart.</li><li><strong>Stupid Jokes, Smart Explosions</strong> – <em>POSTAL</em>-style humor and a lot of things blowing up. Sometimes both at once.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
