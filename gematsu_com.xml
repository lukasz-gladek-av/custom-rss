    <p><span>There's a little Asocial Giraffe in all of us.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Qual Button has released the reveal trailer for comedy <a title="Genres > Point-and-Click [67 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/point-and-click">point-and-click adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/a-week-in-the-life-of-asocial-giraffe">A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe</a></em>. <span id="more-931041"></span></p><p>“With <em>A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe</em> we wanted to make a game that captures the internal conflict and unease that comes with wanting social interaction, while paradoxically being too timid to engage,” said the writer and level designer at <a title="Companies > Quail Button" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/quail-button">Quail Button</a> in a press release. “Because even the most extraverted people still have moments of shyness. In that sense, there’s a little Asocial Giraffe in all of us.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3071440/A_Week_in_the_Life_of_Asocial_Giraffe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Can you make it through the week without talking to anyone as a giraffe living in the friendliest city in the world?</p><p>Giraffe is quite happy with his life. He likes listening to lo-fi music, drinking matcha, eating sushi, taking care of his succulent plants, and writing haikus. There’s just one thing that makes his life hard: he’s so anxious about being in social situations that his head would explode if he ever talks to anyone. Fortunately, that’s never happened yet: as you’ll see, Giraffe has gotten good at sneaking around, distracting, and avoiding the overly chatty residents of Friendly City (voted friendliest city in the world!).</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We at Quail Button are happy to announce <em>A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe</em>, a point-and-click stealth game where the goal is to make sure nobody talks to you so that your head does not explode. You’ll get to experience an average week of Giraffe’s life as he does exciting things on his to-do list, such as going to the laundromat, perusing antique stores, purchasing groceries, and working out at the gym, all while making sure the incredibly sociable citizens of Friendly City never have a chance to speak with him so that his head will not explode.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>A story about avoiding any and all social contact and Giraffe’s quest to live his best life without ever talking to anyone.</li><li>A chore-filled week’s worth of levels that combine the logic and humor of point-and-click <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,901 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> puzzles with the tension of <a title="Genres > Stealth [71 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth games</a>.</li><li>Dozens of Friendly City’s friendly residents to avoid, all of whom are delighted to talk your head off—literally.</li><li>Hand-drawn art and traditional animation of Friendly City’s locations, inhabitants, and Giraffe’s head exploding.</li><li>Music that combines the diegetic soundscape of Friendly City with the calming melody of lo-fi music.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,829 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3071440/A_Week_in_the_Life_of_Asocial_Giraffe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.
