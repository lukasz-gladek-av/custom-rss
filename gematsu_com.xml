Players can create and customize their own personal chaos gremlin, who are sent underground by the titular <em>Mother Machine</em> to battle alien enemies, discover rare technology, and uncover the mysterious planet’s darkest secrets.</p><p>In <em>Mother Machine</em>, players can:</p><ul><li>Create and control their own unique chaos gremlin, capable of seamlessly running, climbing and leaping through intricate procedurally-generated alien caves</li><li>Customize the abilities of their gremlins with a range of mutations, altering gameplay to suit their preferred playstyle</li><li>Share the experience with friends of all skill levels, as the game’s balanced cooperative mechanics allow expert cave-runners to join together with novices</li><li><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> unique moments created by emergent gameplay, idiosyncratic level design and the singular brand of chaos that comes from you and your best gaming buddies</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Set thousands of years in the future, <em>Mother Machine</em> takes place on a distant planet once colonized by humans but since abandoned. Left behind by her creators, an Artificial Intelligence faced a problem: without a purpose, she needed to find a way to protect her digital mind from breaking under the burden of being forever alone. Her solution was to create creatures she could care for.</p><p>True rascals, with an affinity for mischief and chaos, these little gremlins were bioengineered by their mother to withstand and survive a harsh alien environment. 3D-printed from organic filament by their godlike <em>Mother Machine</em>, these creatures are tasked to collect and explore a vast cave network of a mysterious alien planet, brimming with biodiversity and peculiar life-forms—but the further the gremlins venture, the more they find out about the dark secrets of the planet’s history, and the true ambitions of their mechanical mother.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Explore the vast open world filled with challenging events, and raid your enemies.</p><p><strong>Player-Versus-Player, Player-Versus-Environment, Raiding</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We have three types of servers in <em>Deadside</em> 1.0: Player-Versus-Player, Player-Versus-Environment, and Player-Versus-Player No Raids.</p><p>Note on all three types of servers your player disappears when offline with all loot on your body</p><ul><li>Player-Versus-Player servers provide an intense hardcore experience where players can engage in fights, and can raid each other’s bases with no limits.</li><li>Player-Versus-Environment servers are a more chill experience where you can interact with other players, and can’t fight each other or raid/steal each other’s bases. We recommend this mode to learn the game’s mechanics.</li><li>Player-Versus-Player No Raids are a blend of both, where you can fight each other while being unable to raid bases.</li></ul><p><strong>Vehicles and Fast Travel</strong></p><p>Nobody likes running forever in open world <a title="Genres > Survival [377 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>. <em>Deadside</em> has boats, motorcycles, cars, and a Fast Travel System to easily get around the map.

Store your vehicles, and keep your hard earned loot safe from raiders.</p><p><strong>The World of <em>Deadside</em></strong></p><p>Explore the forests, rivers, and settlements of this post-soviet apocalypse. You can build anywhere outside of settlements. Challenging NPCs patrol the map, and your progression is solely decided by your own skill. There are no levels or bars. Your level is your skill and the equipment you acquire.</p><p><strong>Weapons, Combat System, Missions</strong></p><p>It’s all about the ballistics and variety of weapons. Choose from 32 firearms, and modify them with scopes, expanded mags, flashlights, silencers and other modules. Feeling tactical? Setup tripwire traps, respawn bags, use smoke grenades for cover. The combat system is designed to be hardcore. Combine this with an intuitive missions system with clearly marked objectives on the map and you have the perfect hardcore survival shooter.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,927 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DEADSIDE Console Launch Trailer (Xbox &amp; PlayStation 5)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQihnFiJ3do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
