The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><p>A group of humans, calling themselves ‘The Stalkers,’ discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity found the ‘Seal of Night,’ an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage in Fast-Paced Dynamic Combat</strong> – Dash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers.

Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.</li><li><strong>Discover the Dark World of Medhram</strong> – Explore Medhram in a combination of <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [2,642 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and dark fantasy lore. Survive huge dungeons full of traps, enemies, puzzles and challenges. Discover all kinds of locations, from ancient cathedrals and libraries of knowledge to lost kingdoms and devastated floating cities.</li><li><strong>Complete ‘Hunts’ as a Member of the Stalkers</strong> – Accept a hunt at ‘Crow’s Nest’ and track down the dark beast, find where it hides and hunt the most powerful creatures of the Night.

Find a way to communicate with the Mothman via electromagnetic radiation, but don’t linger. Whatever’s out there is tracking you, too.</p><p>Wander through wooded forests, dank caves, mysterious shrines, sealed catacombs, haunted churches, cult lairs, abandoned military outposts, and other handcrafted environments on a hunt for the world’s most fabled creatures of the night. Discover clues from bloody notes, obscurely placed skeletons, and other oddities to combine wit and intuition and outsmart otherworldly dangers.</p><p>Learn what brought each creature into this world and find a way to contain it before it takes any more lives.
