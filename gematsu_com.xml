    <p><span>Farewell to Penacony with Sunday and Fugue.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “A New Venture on the Eighth Dawn,” will launch on December 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-929490"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update brings the final chapter before the Express sets its course for the mysterious realm of Amphoreus, the Eternal Land. With the journey in Penacony coming to a close, a new story is set to unfold, featuring the debut of two new playable characters, Sunday and Fugue. In addition to these characters and storylines, Version 2.7 also offers Trailblazers a range of immersive experiences to enjoy.</p><p>In the previous story arc, Black Swan suggested that the Crew venture to Amphoreus, a realm so enigmatic that even the Aeon of Trailblaze, Akivili, could not reach. Curious yet cautious, Navigator Miss Himeko decides to gather intel on this destination. Meanwhile, the Crew makes a final stop in Penacony, reuniting with old friends and creating lasting memories before embarking on their next journey.</p><p>The memories of that ‘performance’ at the Penacony Grand Theater are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. It’s not just the Astral Express or Penacony that’s awakened from its dream—Sunday has, too. Having stepped down as head of the Oak Family, he has chosen to “descend to the mortal realm and see what this world is truly like.” Casting aside blessings from both Harmony and Order, Sunday sets out to pursue his vision of a utopia as a mere mortal. With the help of a secret Pepeshi named Wonweek, he returns to Penacony with one wish—to give a final, unforgettable performance before beginning his new journey. His robe and hood provide a fresh appearance and conceal his identity for his last dance in the “Planet of Festivities.”</p><p>While in combat, as a 5-star Imaginary character, Sunday has unique support skills. His Skill allows teammates to immediately take action while increasing their DMG dealt. If the teammate has a summon, both can immediately take action, and the DMG Boost effect is even more evident. Using Sunday’s Ultimate can regenerate Energy for one teammate, as well as causing the character and their summon to be blessed with “The Beatified.” A halo will appear on “The Beatified” teammate, boosting their CRIT DMG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Another character soon to arrive is Fugue, who Trailblazers know as their old friend—Tingyun. Once a tactful foxian girl, she now finds her name, appearance, and even identity stolen. Fate, however, has left her a slender thread of hope, though the mark of Destruction still stirs restlessly within her. Tingyun barely escaped death after her clash with Phantylia during version 1.2’s main storyline and was saved only by the intervention of Madam Ruan Mei from the Genius Society, who granted her a second chance at life. Recently, Himeko and Welt visited Madam Ruan Mei and took it upon themselves to bring Miss Tingyun home, renewing her journey back to the familiar.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_929491"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Fugue is a 5-star Fire character with an affinity with support one teammate in reducing enemies’ Toughness regardless of Weakness Type. When Fugue is in combat, enemy targets will be inflicted with the “Cloudflame Luster” effect. When “Cloudflame Luster” is reduced to 0, the target will take Weakness Break DMG again. Furthermore, when teammates attack Weakness Broken enemy targets, they will also deal Super Break DMG. Not only that, through her Skill, Fugue can increase ally characters’ Break Effects. When she uses her Ultimate, she deals Fire DMG to all enemies regardless of Weakness Type and directly reduces all enemies’ Toughness.</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters, General Jing Yuan and Firefly will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 2.7 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance make them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond new characters and storylines, Version 2.7 introduces an immersive experience aboard the Astral Express’s new Party Car, blending elegance with a sense of nostalgia. Here, a spacious reception area with a sleek marble bar and a classic bartending robot awaits. With the Cosmos as their backdrop, players can enjoy a drink with the Express Crew or quietly reflect by the window, letting the view inspire their thoughts.</p><p>Ascending the stairs, players will find the Trailblazer’s personal quarters. In the “Cosmic Home Décor Guide” event, they’ll transform an empty storage room into a cozy haven, adding areas like a bedroom and bathroom. Using Express Funds earned from tasks, Trailblazers gather furniture piece by piece, crafting a space that reflects their journey through the stars.</p><p>Looking ahead, as the game prepares for Version 3.0, it will introduce the Path of Remembrance, featuring characters with unique summons known as memosprites. Each memosprite will offer distinct abilities in battle, joining allies on this Path and enhancing strategic depth in every encounter.</p><p>The Relic system will be updated in Version 3.0, allowing players to select both a Relic’s Main Stat and Subsidiary Stats during synthesis with specialized tools. By using a certain amount of the new item, Wishful Resin, along with Self-Modeling Resin, players can set both the Main and Sub Stats of a Relic simultaneously.</p><p>Lastly, while sorting through the Trailblazer’s storage boxes, Pom-Pom discovered something special. From the Version 2.7 update through to the end of Version 3.2, Trailblazers will be able to claim the “Gift of the Express,” which grants the opportunity to select one regular 5-star character of their choice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.
