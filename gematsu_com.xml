On top of that, she has learned dance from a young age, making her agile.</li><li><strong>Anami Tsukine</strong> (voiced by Saho Shirasu) – Best friends with Ikuno since childhood. Polite and gracious, but sometimes shows a surprisingly clumsy side. After meeting Rizu, a Crysnut Fairy, begins her quest with Ikuno. She has high academic skills and is good at studying. She is quick-witted, but her laid-back personality makes it difficult to tell.</li><li><strong>Sen</strong> (voiced by Saima nakano) – A Crysnut Fairy. Ikuno tripped and squashed him, and he became one with her as a result of this. He is confident and loved to be praised, loving himself more than he does others.

He has a serious personality and can’t feel rested unless rules are followed. Because of this, he can feel hard to work with, but he has developed a strong bond with Anami.</li><li><strong>Hamester</strong> (voiced by Rika Kinugawa)</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_963797"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ System</strong></p><p><strong>Retrieve the Crysnuts!</strong></p><p>Obtain all Crysnuts scattered throughout the map whilst avoiding the Hameham,</p><p>Hamester’s underlings to clear the stage.</p><p>Throughout the map are items, such as “Nut soda” that heals your health, and “<a title="Companies > Hamster Corporation [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hamster-corporation">Hamster</a> wheel” that will make you invincible against the Hamehams.
