Start as a “tailie,” trapped in eternal servitude aboard a massive mega-train, and fight to rise through the classes, take the engine, and become the conductor. Whether you focus on shooting and raiding, make friends and build alliances, or craft the ultimate base and gear, every new train is a chance to carve your own path to freedom.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_944852"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Start Your Revolution</strong> – Lead your uprising however you choose—through force, strategy, or social cunning. The train’s AI may want to keep you subservient by limiting your clone supply, but the most daring rebels know that even if your group runs out of respawns, there are always the remains of other tailies attempts at the engine for you to raid and fuel your comeback. You can even pause your revolution by entering cryo sleep and return whenever you’re ready to continue the fight.</li><li><strong>Take What’s Yours</strong> – Discover rare tech and isotopes or pillage them from the engine. Extract to your dagger shuttle, your personal escape pod and assault craft, to secure your spoils. Upgrade your dagger from a rusty bucket to a powerful transport capable of raiding other trains.</li><li><strong>Own an Engine</strong> – Claim your own train, add new carriages, and build the community of your dreams—or your enemy’s nightmares. <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge your passengers carefully or risk an uprising of your own.</li><li><strong>Derail the Opposition</strong> – Raid rival trains to steal resources and eliminate competitors. But beware—there’s always a bigger train waiting to strike.</li><li><strong>Community First Development</strong> – Red Rover has been developing <em>Enginefall</em> with playtesting and player feedback at its core for over a year. <em>Enginefall</em> is expected to leave the station in early 2026, and we want you to be part of the journey.
