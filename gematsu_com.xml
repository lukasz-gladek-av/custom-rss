        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The full remake of the second installment in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> series, originally released in 2003, titled <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly</em>. This Japanese-style horror adventure game follows twin sisters who become lost in an abandoned village haunted by vengeful spirits. Using the Camera Obscura—a device that can capture and seal away the impossible—they fight ghosts as the story unfolds.</p><p>This title has undergone a complete overhaul, with improvements to everything from visuals and audio to the core gameplay systems and controls. The signature Camera Obscura mechanic, used to capture and fend off spirits, remains a key feature, now offering richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat. In addition, the new “Holding Hands with Mayu” mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Twin sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura visit a stream they remember from their childhood memories.</p><p>The area will soon be submerged by a dam. As Mio reminisces, her older sister Mayu is drawn away by a crimson-colored butterfly, leading her toward the rumored village that no longer appears on any map.</p><p>It is a village of vengeful spirits hunting for the twins girls who fled their ritual. A village of never-ending night.</p><p>As Mio tries to find Mayu and escape from the village, her actions unknowingly retrace the horrors of the past.</p><p>In the deepest reaches of the village, Mio uncovers the truth behind the “forbidden ritual that must never be witnessed.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
