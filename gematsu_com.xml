The Switch version will feature a litter of new playable dog breeds, which will be available as downloadable content for the PC version.</p><p>“Whether a veteran gamer needs a cozy, dog-themed palette cleanser, or a young child is experiencing their intro to the wonders of video games, <em>DORONKO WANKO</em> provides charming fun for all ages,” said Bandai Namco Studios in a press release. “We’re proud to bring an enjoyable, accessible game to such a prominent platform as the <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Phoenixx:</p><blockquote><p>Mom keeps her house so pristine! It would be a shame if… newly-added furry friends… made a heckin’ mess all over the place! Alongside <em>DORONKO WANKO</em>‘s playful Pomeranian protagonist, unleash the rascal within as three new breeds are added to the mix of playable puppers. </p><p>How much will it cost to clean this up? As much as possible! Roll around in nearby puddles, tippy-tap into clean areas of the house, then shake-shake-shake to splatter muddy mayhem in every direction and rack up a six-figure housekeeping bill. Don’t worry, master could never be mad at such a cute, smol doggo, right?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hop onto kitchen countertops, run across shelves, and into various rooms to paint a multicolored messterpiece by knocking over nearby staining liquids like tomato juice, wine, coffee, ink, and paint. Explore the entire house to find special rooms in which to wreak even more havoc prior to discovery.</p><p>Snoot-boop power buttons of nearby appliances — like robot vacuums and fans — that can fling muck even further than any floofer’s tiny toe beans could ever touch. Don dirt-spreading wearables like miniature mess cannons and sludge-spouting whales to dishevel rooms at a devious pace. Pick up misplaced items like mugs and toys, then return them to the right spot to solve bamboozling puzzles that unlock special gifts. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As they battle through hordes of enemies across five vibrant biomes, players will uncover hidden weapons, power-ups and upgrades. Each enemy defeated makes Ada stronger, unlocking new weapons, abilities, movement upgrades and more. By defeating Overlords, players can steal their equippable Shaper Cores, significantly boosting Ada’s power. Be warned—just as Ada grows stronger, the challenges ahead also intensify, requiring players to adapt to increasingly complex warfare and evolving environments.</p><p>The game’s standout feature is its variety of gameplay, letting players experiment with different builds and discover new synergies. At launch, <em>Battle Shapers</em> offers:</p><ul><li>28 weapons, including 16 standard variants and 24 corrupted variants</li><li>52 weapon and gear modifiers, which can be customized using the Mod Extractor to switch modifiers between weapons and gear</li><li>24 unique abilities</li><li>Four distinct Shaper Cores (Adamant Core, Volt Core, Wind Core and Strike Core) that can be equipped in Primary or Secondary slots<!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Equipping a Primary Core changes Ada’s appearance, granting the player a different melee and an additional Ultimate ability</li></ul></li><li>38 Shaper Core <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>rs with varying bonuses, from granting players aerial mastery with an additional Windstep, to replacing the Dash upgrade with a piercing Overkill Laser</li><li>…and so much more.</li></ul><p>During Early Access, players received new gameplay and narrative content every few weeks, with the 1.0 Phantom Code update marking the ninth update since the October 2023 launch. The game has built a dedicated following, and to show appreciation, the developers are introducing features based on popular demand. One key addition is the Endgame Difficulty System, where players can adjust the difficulty with Fragment Effects and Access Levels, and unlock rewards by completing successful runs. This system also leads to the game’s true ending.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Battle Shapers 1.0 Version Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DuU1Od3G0I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
