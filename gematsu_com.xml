        <p>Try to survive this cursed game with some help from an unusual cat.</p><p>This game includes scenes where information from the player’s PC environment is displayed within the game. When streaming or recording, enabling “Streamer Mode” is strongly recommended to prevent a loss of privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we are participating in the Steam Next Fest, (starting on February 24) and a demo version is already available. Save data from the demo can be transferred to the full version, so please take this opportunity to play <em>DYPING: ESCAPE</em> and add it to your wishlist.</p><p><strong>About the Game</strong></p><p>“Let’s play a typing game. All you have to do is type what I tell you to. You don’t have to think at all.”</p><p>A pair of creepy, mysterious eyeballs is your game master. You’ll follow their instructions to progress through a typing game… but also be forced to sign a rather unreasonable contract.</p><p>Whatever you type becomes reality and is inflicted upon you. You might be asked to run programs you don’t want to, or even hack your own system in an act of self-destruction. You might have to watch in horror as your computer breaks down before your very eyes. There’s not much you can really do to fight against this, especially in a typing game… But with the help of a cat awakened from an ancient game, perhaps you can escape.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/dyping-escape-launches-march-13]]></content:encoded>
