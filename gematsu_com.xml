    <p><span>More games and features coming in the future.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Digital Eclipse [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a> have released a free update for <em><a title="Games > Tetris Forever [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tetris-forever">Tetris Forever</a></em>, which adds the MS-DOS game <em>Welltris</em> to the collection, as well as updates to <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> and other improvements. The company also confirmed that it plans to add more games and features to the collection going forward. <span id="more-935902"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Game: <em>Welltris</em> (Spectrum Holobyte, MS-DOS)</strong></p><p>The first follow-up to <em>Tetris</em> created by Alexey Pajitnov, Welltris is a beloved variant in which Tetriminos (and other shapes) fall down four sides of a well.</p><p><strong><em>Tetris Time Warp</em></strong></p><p>All players can now individually remap their controls in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, the new four-player Digital Eclipse game included in <em>Tetris Forever</em> that has proven to be a hit with both casual and competitive players. Control remapping was the most requested feature change from players.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Other Improvements</strong></p><p>More customization options: Players can now remap their controls in Electronika 60, MS-DOS &amp; Apple II games on console. This functionality was previously added to the <a title="Platforms > PC [22,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version in November. </p><p>Switch version audio fix: At launch, a conflict with the Rewind functionality caused audio issues that could be heard while playing some classic games in the <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> version of <em>Tetris Forever</em>. As a first step, the team has disabled the Rewind function in games that had audio glitches, which has fixed the issue. The team will look into the possibility of restoring Rewind in a future update.</p><p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p><p>It is Digital Eclipse’s goal to continue to improve and expand on <em>Tetris Forever</em> with more games and features. The teams at <em>Tetris</em> and Digital Eclipse continue to explore adding new games to the collection, as well as addressing further feature requests and reported issues. The team’s next priority is to address an issue in some classic games that prevent users from saving or registering high scores, for which they expect to issue a fix in early January. </p><p>Jason Cirillo, the lead designer and programmer of <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, is currently working on a larger update to the game, with support from the rest of Digital Eclipse, adding a variety of new features and modes based on player feedback, which will be released in early 2025.</p></blockquote><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,519 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,687 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/tetris-forever/december-20-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_935903"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
