      </p></div><div><p>The full-motion video romance sim <em><a title="Games > Five Hearts Under One Roof" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/five-hearts-under-one-roof">Five Hearts Under One Roof</a></em> is back—available now for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/61229/Five_Hearts_Under_One_Roof_Franchise_Pack/" target="_blank">Steam</a>—picking up Yuman’s story as he once again finds himself running a boarding house that’s anything but ordinary. This new season brings more heroines, more branching paths, and more chances to get tangled up in the emotions of everyone living under the same roof.</p><p>Old faces Mal-sook, Gran, and Min-jung return, joined by newcomers Yu-na, Yoo-jung, and Gyu-ri. Each one shifts the atmosphere of the house in their own way. Paired with upgraded visuals, a smoother progression flow, and a few added systems that shake up how each route unfolds, <em>season2</em> aims to deliver a more approachable and more engaging experience than the original.</p><h2><span>Returning Favorites and New Heroines Join the Boarding House</span></h2><p><strong>Mal-sook Go</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Yuman’s first tenant and a childhood friend he’s known for 20 years. She jokes that he’s “under her control,” but there’s something she’s been hiding from him—something she still can’t bring herself to say.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Gran Dong</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>The second tenant and Yuman’s supervisor at work. Gran lives and breathes her job, brushing off anything that isn’t work-related. The one exception is Yuman, who she watches more closely than she admits. She even asks him to drop the “<a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger” title when they’re off the clock.</p><p><strong>Yu-na Jeong</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_004a.jpg"></a></figure><p>The third tenant and the youngest daughter of a major conglomerate family. Outgoing and cheerful on the surface, she’s labeled the “useless” one at home, and the trouble she causes pushes her into Yuman’s boarding house.</p><p><strong>Min-jung Park</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>The fourth tenant and Yuman’s first love. After rising from an overlooked idol to a national sweetheart, a sudden scandal threatens to derail it all. With nowhere else to turn, she finds her way back to Yuman’s boarding house.</p><p><strong>Yoo-jung Yang</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>The last tenant is a quiet girl who throws herself into work. Past bullying makes it hard for her to face others, and she’s been postponing college because of it. Yuman becomes the first person to truly acknowledge her for who she is.</p><p><strong>Gyu-ri Bang</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>A nurse known for her warmth and dedication. Patients adore her, but lately she’s been catching herself thinking about Yuman in ways that go beyond professional concern. It’s only a matter of time before she edges closer to becoming a tenant herself.</p><h2><span>Expanded Narrative Paths and Improved Immersion</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>season2</em> is once again shot fully from Yuman’s perspective, pulling players directly into the conversations, choices, and emotional moments. The video team behind the first season returns, this time with more natural performances and cleaner cinematography.</p><p>New epilogues, hidden routes, and additional interactive elements give players more ways to shape each heroine’s storyline. Bonus scenes and fresh branches also encourage multiple playthroughs for players who want to see every path unfold.</p><h2><span>A Deeper Focus on Character Growth</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>This season takes time to show how each heroine has changed since the last. Some face new challenges, others find their confidence shifting, and a few are grappling with complicated feelings toward Yuman. These developments play into how each route moves forward, adding new layers to relationships that began in the first season.</p><p>As everyone grows in their own way, the boarding house becomes a place where old emotions, new tensions, and unresolved moments collide, shaping the connections that form throughout the story.</p><h2><span>A House Full of Unforgettable Romance</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FHUOR2-Sponsored_11-25-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>With a larger cast, expanded story routes, and refined presentation, <em><a title="Games > Five Hearts Under One Roof season2" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/five-hearts-under-one-roof-season2">Five Hearts Under One Roof season2</a></em> brings players another round of heartfelt full-motion video drama.
