I’m grateful to everyone who helped bring it to this moment, especially the teams at Apogee, <a title="Companies > Atari [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a>, and <a title="Companies > Infogrames [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari/infogrames">Infogrames</a>. See you on the island. Listen carefully to the voice you follow.”</p><p>Apogee Entertainment executive producer Jeron Moore added, “<em>Total Chaos</em> is Apogee’s first step into survival horror and a full-circle moment for Sam, whose early love for classics like <em>DOOM</em>, <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em>, and the horror genre at large helped inspire this original vision. What began as a total conversion mod has grown into a faithful and expanded remake. Our creative bond from <em><a title="Games > Turbo Overkill [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a></em> made it a privilege to support him again and ensure <em>Total Chaos</em> delivers a truly landmark horror experience.”</p><p>Guest composer Akira Yamaoka said, “I am truly honored to have taken part in this collaboration with <em>Total Chaos</em>. Within the chaos lies a hidden silence—an invisible world that cannot be captured by words, but only expressed through sound. It is an experience like a journey where unseen landscapes are felt through the ears rather than seen by the eyes. I hope you enjoy it.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Apogee Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
