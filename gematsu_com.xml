It will support English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese language options. <span id="more-973286"></span></p><p>“What we and <a title="Companies > Neotro [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/neotro">Neotro</a> kept hearing from fans was that they loved <em>NeverAwake</em>‘s world and challenges, but wanted more content and replayability,” said developer Hiroshi Sawatari in a press release. “We hope this is a nightmare <em>NeverAwake</em> fans will never want to wake up from!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Phoenixx:</p><blockquote><p>After escaping the ordeals of <em>NeverAwake</em>, protagonist Rem thought she found peace, but her sweet dreams start to turn dark again. Joined by her plushie Gabe-chan, Rem must once again dive deep into her subconscious and fight literal sleep demons to enjoy peace once more. But now, the nightmares keep changing.</p><p>Flying about procedurally-generated arenas, blasting away twisted versions of youthful fears like terrifying dentist tools, broccoli monsters, and aggressive chihuahua ghouls in 360-degree combat. At the start of each run, combine three weapons and three accessories to optimize Rem’s attacks to collect souls to progress and unlock upgrades. Use Gabe-chan’s special abilities to help turn the tide against the apparitions.</p><p>Fight through 50 procedurally-generated stages in randomized order, swapping out weapons and abilities as needed. Play through new series of levels each time, or use a simple code to replay a favorite seed of levels. Fight dangerous new bosses, navigate new hazards, in an experience that combines quick pick-up-and-play action while giving NeverAwake veterans new challenges in a familiar environment.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>NeverAwake FLASHBACK</em> will also appear at <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/event/shooters-fes-2025">Shooters Fes 2025</a> on June 15, where Phoenixx and Neotro will share the latest information, game specifications, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
