This culminates on the third day, where if players were successful in surviving the night must take on one of the Nightlords—new bosses for this version. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the <em><a title="Games > Elden Ring [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a></em> universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat.
