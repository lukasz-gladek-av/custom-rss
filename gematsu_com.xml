I’m proud of what we’ve built together and deeply grateful to everyone who has been part of this journey.</p><p>“While this marks the end of Neon Doctrine in its current form, I know our games are in excellent hands with Raw Fury and will continue to thrive as part of their ecosystem.”</p><p>Neon Doctrine co-founder and chief corporate officer Vlad Tsopljak will leave the company alongside Garner.</p><p>“This wasn’t a decision taken lightly by either of us,” Tsopljak said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7389178563385765888/" target="_blank">separate post</a>. “After long, deep discussions, Iain and I concluded this was the best path forward—it ensures the games we poured our hearts (and youth) into are supported, celebrated, and will continue to thrive for years to come.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
