As they battle through hordes of enemies across five vibrant biomes, players will uncover hidden weapons, power-ups and upgrades. Each enemy defeated makes Ada stronger, unlocking new weapons, abilities, movement upgrades and more. By defeating Overlords, players can steal their equippable Shaper Cores, significantly boosting Ada’s power. Be warned—just as Ada grows stronger, the challenges ahead also intensify, requiring players to adapt to increasingly complex warfare and evolving environments.</p><p>The game’s standout feature is its variety of gameplay, letting players experiment with different builds and discover new synergies. At launch, <em>Battle Shapers</em> offers:</p><ul><li>28 weapons, including 16 standard variants and 24 corrupted variants</li><li>52 weapon and gear modifiers, which can be customized using the Mod Extractor to switch modifiers between weapons and gear</li><li>24 unique abilities</li><li>Four distinct Shaper Cores (Adamant Core, Volt Core, Wind Core and Strike Core) that can be equipped in Primary or Secondary slots<!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Equipping a Primary Core changes Ada’s appearance, granting the player a different melee and an additional Ultimate ability</li></ul></li><li>38 Shaper Core <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>rs with varying bonuses, from granting players aerial mastery with an additional Windstep, to replacing the Dash upgrade with a piercing Overkill Laser</li><li>…and so much more.</li></ul><p>During Early Access, players received new gameplay and narrative content every few weeks, with the 1.0 Phantom Code update marking the ninth update since the October 2023 launch. The game has built a dedicated following, and to show appreciation, the developers are introducing features based on popular demand. One key addition is the Endgame Difficulty System, where players can adjust the difficulty with Fragment Effects and Access Levels, and unlock rewards by completing successful runs. This system also leads to the game’s true ending.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Battle Shapers 1.0 Version Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DuU1Od3G0I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His main mechanic—breaking the fourth wall, which allows him to communicate with you in a multitude of ways.</p><p><em>Morkull Ragast’s Rage</em> is a 2D video game that combines platforming and action with a touch of exploration.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You control Morkull, the villain of the story, who not only knows he’s a character in a video game, but is also aware of the player who controls him (i.e., you) and the developers who created him (i.e., us).</p><p>Your objective? Help Morkull escape from the Ragast so he can rule the world and carry out his evil plans.</p><p>You know, typical cliche villain stuff…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Art and Animation</strong> – <em>Morkull Ragast’s Rage</em> is completely hand-drawn and animated frame-by-frame. Inspired and influenced by traditional animated films and other 2D video games, the old-school style gives life and fluidity of movement to the whole cast of characters.</li><li><strong>Break the Fourth Wall</strong> – What makes this game special is Morkull himself, his personality, and his ability to break the fourth wall to talk with the players like he was there in the room. Morkull possesses charisma and charm, and never fails to create a light-hearted atmosphere with his endless humor, bad jokes and pop culture references.</li><li><strong>Combat System</strong> – You’ll have all the power of the God of Death and Darkness at your fingertips, of course, along with an ample selection of combos and abilities that will open up even the most remote corners of the Ragast.</li><li><strong>Become Part of the Ragast and Join Our Community</strong> – Once you enter the Ragast, you’ll never leave—unless you can get through Morkull… So why not join his ranks and support his Machiavellian cause with the rest of his champions as part of our <em>Morkull Ragast’s Rage</em> community.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Morkull Ragast's Rage | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoyVeimTDDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
