Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos emerged victorious, twisting the earth and its inhabitants into unspeakable horrors. Defy their might by forging a bond with a powerful RailGod, an ancient abomination from beyond the stars fused with a mighty locomotive.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Board the train and expand it with custom cars for storage, loot, and workbenches. Navigate shifting hellscapes armed with axes, firearms, and spells, battling eldritch horrors and fanatical cultists—or capture them to feed the wheeled monstrosity. Seek the RailGod’s pounding heart to purge the creeping madness and unlock devastating GodKeeper abilities.</p><p>Resist mental torment while foraging for new materials and clues, then return to the RailGod to purge the mind of unearthly visions, develop new skills, and gear up for the next adventure. While the journey is long, this rolling base of operations is never far away – but remember, it always needs to feed… and it has a taste for flesh.</p><p><strong>What’s New in Early Access</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Improved Ranged Combat</strong> – <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d targeting, projectile mechanics, and responsiveness.</li><li><strong>Inventory Filters and Optimization</strong> – Streamlined item <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> for a better user experience.</li><li><strong>Polished Combat Feedback</strong> – More impactful hit reactions, animations, and combat feel.</li><li><strong>Madness Level Gameplay</strong> – Expanded mechanics tied to the Madness system, adding new strategic elements.</li><li><strong>Connected Chests</strong> – Improved resource management by linking storage across carriages.</li><li><strong>Corrupted RailGod Gameplay</strong> – New mechanics and interactions with a corrupted version of the RailGod.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="RailGods of Hysterra - Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU0wo0LRGTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Truth is an illusion, paranoia is constant, and your humanity is an oddity.</p><p>You awake to find yourself a prisoner within a living nightmare. Your name, your past: gone, but not the record of your misdeeds. Your <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es: beyond comprehension. Your conviction: incontestable. Your sentence: eternal. The need to escape and set things right: undeniable.</p><p>Fight your way out of a living, twisting labyrinth. Hone your skills as you take on dynamic combat encounters and absurd puzzles. Meet the Cosmic Engine’s most disturbing and grotesque inhabitants, all with unique and nonsensical personalities, who are just as likely to aid in your quest as they are to deceive you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Escape means freedom, and in freedom, the truth.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Fantasy Adventure</strong> – Descend through the surreal, twisting Spire as you recover from amnesia and slowly discover the morbid truth about your past and your hostile surroundings. Cling to your sanity as the very fabric of reality is unraveled before your eyes.</li><li><strong>Swiss Army <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">Hack-and-Slash</a></strong> – Take on the army of undead with an arsenal of unorthodox weapons and accessories. You may prefer the quick slices of the Chainsword for large hordes of enemies while reserving the devastating blows of the Power Hammer for boss fights. Or go all-out and replace your entire arm with a fully functioning cannon. Mix and match to find the build that best suits your playstyle.</li><li><strong>Puzzling Paranoia</strong> – Test your resolve with a myriad of environmental and logic puzzles. In a world devoid of sense and reason, you’ll have to stoop to your lowest if it means moving forward. Solve puzzles by drinking blood, forcing regurgitation, and digging through viscera. Fun.</li><li><strong>Will the Madness Ever End?</strong> – Designed especially to torment you, the Cosmic Engine will stop at nothing to keep you contained. Several playthroughs of <em>Moroi</em> will be required to experience all the game has to offer, from subtle changes within the story to the multiple fate-changing endings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Moroi - Official Release Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSsL82tpsTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
