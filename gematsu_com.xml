Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokemon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokemon and other Pokemon not usually found in Lumiose, some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</p><p>Hoopa’s powers are awakened when it receives one of Ansha’s donuts, transforming the distortions into portals to hyperspace. Ansha uses Berries to create various kinds of donuts that grant different effects in hyperspace, such as powering up your Pokemon. She can also use more potent Hyperspace Berries, which are useful for taking on the high-level Pokemon in Hyperspace Lumiose.</p><p>Trainers will be joined by new allies such as Korrina, a successor to a line of Mega Evolution gurus determined to encounter every Mega-Evolved Pokemon.
