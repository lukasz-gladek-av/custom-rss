    <div><p>High-speed mech <a title="Genres > Action [2,380 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em>Project Six</em> is officially titled <em><a title="Games > OMEGA PHENEX COMMENCED PROJECT SIX" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/omega-phenex-commenced-project-six">OMEGA PHENEX COMMENCED PROJECT SIX</a></em>, independent Japanese developer <a title="Companies > Surume Koubou" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/surume-koubou">Surume Koubou</a> announced. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,011 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392040/OMEGA_PHENEX_COMMENCED_PROJECT_SIX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> when it launches. A release date has not been announced. <span id="more-935214"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392040/OMEGA_PHENEX_COMMENCED_PROJECT_SIX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>You will become a pilot of the mech “Icarus,” which has tremendous maneuverability. You will enjoy a fight and face large powerful armies and rivals by moving from skimming the surface of the sea to the cloud with Icarus. This game is a high-speed mech shooting game capable of firing massive amounts of missiles.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Immerse Yourself in Tactile Mech Action at Overwhelming Speeds</strong><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>This work is characterized by an overwhelming sense of speed. There are no restrictions on turning speed, and the consumption of the boost gauge required for high-speed movement and flight is set to a moderate level. Enemy bullets are easy to avoid, making it easy to enjoy high-speed combat.</li><li>Aim controls follow those of general shooting games such as <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,584 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">FPS</a> and <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,264 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">TPS</a>, so that even those unfamiliar with robot games will find the game easy to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mechanical Customization System for Both Appearance and Performance</strong><ul><li>It also features the mech’s customization functions, such as changing parts and painting capabilities. The performance of each part varies slightly, but the performance of the mechs is largely determined by the “Tune” function. This “Tune” can be used to enhance any parameter of your choice, such as durability value, mobility, or weapon performance by spending a limited predefined amount of the cost.</li><li>This allows you to customize your mechs’ to your preferred appearance while pursuing your preferred fighting style.</li></ul></li><li><strong>More Than 30 Missions, Plus an “Arena Mode” for One-on-One Battles</strong><ul><li>The game includes a wide variety of missions, such as extermination, exploration missions, boss battles and escort missions (we are considering a less stressful specification for the escort missions). In addition, there is an “Arena Mode” for one-on-one combat with the enemy “Icarus.”</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Title Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="PROJECT SIX official title announcement and opening of the steam store." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsu5cxQB_4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
