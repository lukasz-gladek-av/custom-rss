            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The legendary Carmageddon engine roars back to life, reimagined for a new era of vehicular combat.</p><p><em>Carmageddon</em> smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem. Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.</p><p><strong>The Long Night</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The year is 2050, and the world you know is a post‑apocalyptic wasteland.</p><p>Hordes of nightmare creatures, the Wasted, lay siege to humanity. Every night, the streets are overrun, forcing everyone to barricade themselves in their skyscraper-homes for <a title="Genres > Survival [489 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</p><p>There is just one chance to escape all this: the Carmageddon.</p><p>These deadly races promise power, prestige, and valuable prizes to the participants. Most importantly, the champion wins the right to attempt the perilous journey that leads to the spaceport beyond the mountains. The only one left, the only chance to flee this dying world.</p><p>You enter the <em>Carmageddon</em> as one of countless racers, equipped with little more than a rust bucket, scavenged fuel, and a makeshift weapon. You’ll face off against rival gangs like the Autoscum and other rogues in a fight for survival. Each destruction race is an opportunity to win parts and upgrades, a step towards the ultimate escape.</p><p>As the night descends, the Wasted take the streets, and you with them.</p><p><strong>Drive to Survive</strong></p><p>The original <em>Carmageddon</em> spirit of vehicular mayhem has been refined and redesigned. We looked at the past and the present to create a visceral, fast and accessible form of combat racing.</p><ul><li><strong>15 Upgradeable Vehicles</strong> – FWD, RWD, and AWD, each with unique weight and suspension</li><li><strong><a title="Platforms > Meta [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l‑on‑Metal Car Combat</strong> – Crash, shove, boost and side‑bash rivals</li><li><strong>13 Weapon Classes</strong> – From shotguns to railguns, all fully upgradable</li><li><strong>Over 80 Perks</strong> – Craft outrageous synergies for destruction racing supremacy</li><li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Day‑Night Cycle</strong> – Rain slicks the tarmac, fog shrouds ambushes</li><li><strong>Elite and Boss Events</strong> – Colossal war‑rigs, corrupted Enforcers, and endless zombie hordes</li><li><strong>Extensive Visual Damage Model</strong> – Windshields, hood, doors, bumpers and trunk lid will bend, crumple, hang and detach.</li></ul><p><strong>The Roguelite Campaign</strong></p><p>Every Campaign run offers a unique journey through a randomly generated graph.</p><p>Win Events and smash opponents to gain Credits. Maneuvers such as killing Wasteds, drifts, jumps, and flicks also grant rewards.</p><p>Strategically plan your route so you can reach Shops. In these safe havens you can repair your car, swap weapons, or install one of the 80+ unlockable perks.</p><p>Adapt to the dynamically increasing difficulty and conquer elite events and bosses.</p><p>With branching paths, varied objectives, and ever-changing time-of-day and weather conditions, no two runs are the same.</p><p>But the <em>Carmageddon</em> ain’t over when your vehicle is wrecked. Another driver will step up, and the challenge will resume anew, in a typical roguelite loop. Earn Beatcoins to unlock permanent bonuses and new content between runs in the Black Market. Find synergies between these elements to create the ultimate killing machine: the Carmageddon never ends.</p><p><strong>Opponents</strong></p><p>The Carmageddon hosts a diverse assembly of marauders, rejects, and lowlifes. Some prefer to rush in front of the pack. Others will chase you and try to bash you out of the way. Some will wait for the chance to unload their weapons into your car. Some are more skilled or better prepared than others. You may recognize some familiar names in the crowd.</p><p>Corrupt police forces known as the Enforcers impose their brutal rules on those spared from mutation. The Enforcers will force you off the road to strip your car for spare parts and ammo, if you let them.</p><p>Each area of the city is controlled by a particularly fierce opponent, commonly known as “the Boss”. These are the biggest, baddest, fastest, more armed vehicles that you can find. The rules of the Carmageddon demand that you beat each Boss before advancing to the next stage.</p><p>Every race is a brutal test of skill, demanding you master driving, melee, and ranged attacks against a diverse and unpredictable roster of foes. To do so, you must work on your car, find upgrades and weapons that combine well together, and consistently perform behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>The Wasted</strong></p><p>The Third World War and a series of devastating natural disasters left Earth in ruins. Amidst the chaos, a food supplement called MiVis was introduced to address food shortages, and became a ubiquitous part of daily life.</p><p>However, long-term consumption of MiVis led to a horrific cellular mutation, transforming people into Wasted – monstrous, empty husks consumed by the supplement’s side effects.</p><p>Now, they have become a mass of unsentient, super-aggressive beings that threaten survivors as soon as the sun starts to set.</p><p>A lone Wasted is no match for your chariot of fury. Things start to heat up when more Wasteds show up. Boost into the hordes of humanoid husks swarming the track, parting the waves of Wasted like a Moses on wheels! But be careful not to get stuck in the high tide: too many Wasteds will surround your car and smash it to bits with the remains of their raw hands.</p><p>And then there are Special Wasteds… horrible supermutations of the Wasted, morphed into something even less human.</p><p>They may explode, shoot you from a distance, lunge at your car, or produce even nastier surprises.</p><p>They pose a real danger and tend to show up late at night.</p><p>And then, there’s the ultimate abomination. A creature whispered about, rarely seen; the monster that guards the only mountain pass towards salvation, and your final challenge.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/carmageddon-rogue-shift-launches-in-early-2026-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
