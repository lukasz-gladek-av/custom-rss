Tire Boy may be the last of his kind, and was lost as a child. At the start of the game, we learn he was found and raised by a large owl named Nestwijk and doesn’t know much about his family or ancestors.</p><p>It’s a story about connection and curiosity, as Tire Boy journeys through a vast, unfamiliar world, searching for purpose and traces of his forgotten origins. <em>Tire Boy</em> is weird, heartfelt, and full of little surprises—and we’ve built it to feel like a place you’ll want to come back to, whether you’re chasing big moments or just soaking in the quiet ones.</p><!-- AD: content -->

A physical edition will be available for Switch via the <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/off/products/off-game-nintendo-switch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fangamer store</a> in Q4 2025. <span id="more-971445"></span></p><p>A demo, <em>OFF Prologue</em>, is currently available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3746910/OFF_Prologue/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Featuring up to an hour of gameplay, it acts as a prologue to the game and puts the player in control over the Batter at the very start of the game.

I’ve been entrusted with a sacred mission.”</p><p>One of the most influential <a title="Genres > RPG [17,324 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> of the last 20 years is finally coming to Steam. Take control of the Batter as he seeks to purify an uncanny and hopeless world haunted by specters, guided by a cryptic, grinning cat called The Judge.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Allow Me to Confess That I Find You Quite Tangible for a Phantasmagorical Being</strong></p><p>I must say, this is really quite strange. You are the first living being I have ever met in this place. Nevertheless, I will introduce myself. I am the Judge.</p><p><strong>The Batter Has a Sacred Mission to Fulfill</strong></p><p>He seeks to purify the world. You, then, the controller, the soul that he harbors, must aid him in this laudable task. Alongside my sportive companion you will find it necessary to solve puzzles, rain blows upon certain hostile individuals of our wild zones, and oversee the headways and logistics of a network of swan boats and interurban locomotives.</p><p><strong>I, Too, Travel Widely Among the Zones of This World</strong></p><p>Open your wings and fly toward the zones ahead without hesitation! All of them are filled with strange and enchanting beings as well as every modern convenience. All of them appear, it must be said, to require the beneficent application of our friend the Batter’s muscular wrist. Do not worry, my dear phantasm—I, the Judge, will be with you (in spirit and body) at all the most crucial moments of your quest.</p><p><strong>I’m Going to Cut That Insufferable Smile Right Out of Your Face</strong></p><p>How dare you talk to me? Why have you decided to be such a pain in my ass? The Queen chose me to protect Zone 1, and I’ve dedicated my whole life to it. </p><p>Listen. Get out of here, and take those ghosts with you, or I am going to kill you. I hope that’s clear enough.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>From Semblance studio Nyamakop.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>South African developer <a title="Companies > Nyamakop [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nyamakop">Nyamakop</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Relooted [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/relooted">Relooted</a></em>, an Africanfuturist heist game in which you plan, parkour, and reclaim real looted African Artifacts from Western museums. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/relooted-89fdd7" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971423"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nyamakop:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A crew. A job. A plan. Toss those ingredients together, and you’ve got yourself a classic heist—but with a few twists. Your crew members are everyday citizens (from different countries in Africa) with pretty normal careers. The job is to liberate African artifacts from Western museums. And the plan? Well, that’s up to you to create.</p><p><strong>Africanfutur-heist</strong></p><p>Near the end of the 21st century, the political powers that be brokered a Transatlantic Returns Treaty, promising the repatriation of African artifacts from museums. Good old fashioned diplomacy was working—until it wasn’t. An amendment switched up the terms and conditions of which objects were to be returned. Museums, now knowing that only publicly displayed artifacts would be given back, were slowly removing artifacts from public display.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When life gives you lemons and museums pulling shady moves, it’s time to chuck the lemons back at life and try a new, <a title="Genres > Stealth [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ier form of diplomacy. You’ve got 70 of these artifacts to (re)loot, all of which exist in real-life and are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</p><p><strong>Teamwork Makes The Heist Work</strong></p><p>It all starts with a troublesome little brother, who, yeah, gets you into all sorts of messes. But thankfully, as Nomali, you’ll meet more reliable crew members from different African countries. Recruit people from the classic hacker to… your prim and proper grandma? Don’t worry, grandma pulls her weight.</p><p><strong>Case the Joint</strong></p><p>Plan ahead to lay the groundwork for a beautiful masterpiece of an escape. Check the getaway route, fiddle with puzzles and obstacles, and find spots to recruit the help of the right teammates.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971428"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Get In. Get Out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve set the stage carefully and the artifact is sitting all pretty—looking quite not-stolen, but no worries, you’re gonna fix that ASAP—this is the moment to perform. Plucking an artifact from its resting spot starts the countdown timer, and with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities, escape should feel like you’re in the fun, montage part of a heist movie. But if you slacked on the planning phase, you’re gonna pay for it!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pull Off Heists</strong> – Plan and prepare your escape route by solving puzzles and placing teammates in the right place. When you’re ready, take the artifact and escape with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities.</li><li><strong>Recruit a Crew</strong> – Meet and gradually recruit different team members with their unique abilities.</li><li><strong>Explore an Africanfuturist Setting</strong> – With a Hideout based in South Africa, you’ll see parts of Johannesburg imagined in the future.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Real Artifacts</strong> – Recover 70 artifacts that exist in real-life, all of which are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
