    <p><span>Embark on the final campaign of Flame-Chase Journey.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “The Fall at Dawn’s Rise,” will launch on May 21, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [195 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-964197"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers will join forces with Chrysos Heirs as they enter a pivotal chapter of Flame-Chase Journey. In addition, this version also introduces two new playable characters—Hyacine and Cipher—each bringing their own compelling backstory and distinct flair to the unfolding saga. A wide array of limited-time events will also offer fresh excitement and challenges throughout the journey.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Chrysos Heirs reclaimed the Coreflame of “Death” and “Reason.” Now, in Version 3.3, Trailblazers will stand alongside Chrysos Heirs for the final battle of Flame-Chase Journey—confronting the Sky Titan. According to ancient records, Aquila is a hundred-eyed giant bird. With the sky as its eyelids, it controls the cycles of dawn and dusk. In addition, “Echo of War: Glance of Twilight” will also become available in Version 3.3, offering players brand-new challenges and generous rewards.</p><p>While the people of Amphoreus pursue Era Nova from within their world, the geniuses beyond it are watching closely. At the end of Version 3.2, Madam Herta’s data spirit entity successfully reached the Vortex of Genesis. As the Geniuses delve deeper into their investigation, the root of Amphoreus’s tragedy will gradually come to light and its fate will intertwine with that of the galaxy. Yet, how the story unfolds from here is for players to discover in the chapters ahead.</p><p>In the upcoming story, a new 5-star character, Hyacine, will join the Trailblazer’s team as a vital ally. As the chief physician of the Twilight Courtyard, Hyacine has long been responsible for the medical care of Flame-Chasers. Her ideal is to leave a footnote for ordinary people on the blank pages of epic history, doing her utmost to heal every soul in need. A Wind character following the Path of Remembrance, Hyacine excels at restoring HP for the entire team and boosting overall survivability. By using her abilities and summoning Little Ica, she provides continuous healing to her allies. When she unleashes her Ultimate, Hyacine not only restores HP to all teammates but also increases their Max HP. Additionally, whenever any ally (excluding Little Ica) is attacked or voluntarily sacrifices their own HP, Little Ica will consume its own HP to automatically heal them. Beyond healing, Little Ica can also attack enemies, and the damage Little Ica deals scales with the amount of healing performed.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_964199"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Another new 5-star playable character, Cipher, is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to join the Flame-Chase Journey alongside Aglaea and Tribbie. As the inheritor of Trickery’s divine authority, Cipher has wielded this power for years, yet her movements remain elusive and unpredictable. No one has ever been able to pin down her true whereabouts… A Quantum character following the Path of Nihility, Cipher specializes in targeting the enemy with the highest Max HP on the field, placing them under a special status that records all damage they take. She can also actively switch the marked target, allowing for adaptive tactics mid-battle. When allies attack the marked enemy, Cipher performs a follow-up attack. Upon using her Ultimate, she unleashes additional True DMG based on the total recorded damage!</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters The Herta and Aglaea will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.3 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond the compelling story, Version 3.3 also introduces a variety of exciting events that promise brand-new gameplay experiences. Registration is now open for the Penacony Speed Cup Spheroid Racing Tournament, where top racers will gather for high-stakes showdowns! Trailblazers will take the wheel of their Spheroid Racers and engage in thrilling speed challenges. In addition, thanks to Giovanni’s investment, Legend of the Galactic Baseballer: Demon King is officially launching! Based on player feedback during the previous beta test, the official release retains the raccoon’s quest for the bat while adding a host of exciting new elements that bring fresh challenges to the battlefield.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,099 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.
