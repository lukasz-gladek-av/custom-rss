Pre-orders will open in June. <span id="more-950673"></span></p><p>The expansion will feature “numerous cinema-grade” anime story sequences produced by Japanese animation studio MAPPA (known for Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man), as well as the voice talents of Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh (<em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>) reprising her A<em>RK: The Animated Series</em> role as Mei Yin, Madeleine Madden (<em>Wheel of Time</em>) as Helena Walker, Auli’i Cravalho (<em>Moana</em>) as Meeka, and other to-be-announced, fan-favorite characters voiced and depicted for the first time in-game.</p><p>Here is an overview of the content, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Confront the demons of Arat Prime—birthplace of the ARKs—in <em>ARK: Survival Ascended</em>‘s first massive canonical expansion pack, <em>ARK: Lost Colony</em>! Starring Michelle Yeoh as Mei Yin in cinematic anime sequences by legendary Japanese studio MAPPA, the epic new story of <em>ARK: Lost Colony</em> bridges the gap from <em>ARK: Extinction</em> to <em>ARK: Genesis</em> and into the world of <em><a title="Games > ARK II [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ark-ii">ARK II</a></em>. As you follow in Mei Yin’s footsteps through an intense journey into the heart of darkness, you’ll unlock powerful “Lost” character ability trees, befriend exotic tames, craft “Cursed” tiers of gear, and master advanced new building systems!</p><p>But beware, the frozen wastes of Arat Prime are not devoid of intelligent life; on the contrary, the city has become a war-torn battleground between twisted Element-powered ‘factions’ seeking to undo what was accomplished at the end of <em>ARK: Extinction</em>. Together with generations of heroes, you’ll unite the past and the future of <em>ARK</em>!</p></blockquote><p><em>ARK: Survival Ascended</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,894 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
