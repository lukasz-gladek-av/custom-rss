            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em><a title="Games > Battlefield REDSEC [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/battlefield-redsec">Battlefield REDSEC</a></em> is a genre shifting free-to-play destination built on <em>Battlefield</em>‘s iconic DNA, featuring a bold new take on the <a title="Genres > Battle Royale [51 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">Battle Royale</a> genre, an intense squad-based competitive mode called Gauntlet and new ways to unlock the power of Portal. <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>&nbsp;launches alongside Season 1 for <em><a title="Games > Battlefield 6 [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a></em>,which brings the battle to Southern California, introducing new seasonal content to the ultimate all-out warfare experience.</p><p>Today players can join the fight for free, with the launch of <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>, an explosive sandbox set in the backyards and beaches of California in a destructible environment called Fort Lyndon.</p><p>As part of this free-to-play package, players can jump into <em>Battlefield</em>‘s biggest map ever Fort Lyndon, and experience an explosive new take on the Battle Royale genre. <em>Battlefield</em>‘s DNA is fused with the best of the Battle Royale genre, creating unrivaled opportunities for your team to approach each match and achieve ultimate victory. Players drop into a massive battle with 100 players, explore a massive world for powerful loot, and take down enemy squads through <em>Battlefield</em>‘s signature gameplay experience. The power of Tactical Destruction brings an entirely new level of strategy to the genre, as players create their own paths to victory or turn the environment into their own deadly weapon while crushing opposing squads. Each round is a bombastic ride on an incredible cinematic scale that <em>Battlefield</em> is known for.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>‘s free-to-play destination also includes Gauntlet, a new mode which pushes squad competition to a new level of intensity. In this fast-paced elimination mode, eight teams of four-player squads compete in a series of dynamic round-based missions in a tournament-style format. Each round consists of 5-minute windows for squads to complete their mission objectives. Prepare for the unexpected as each round, location, and mission will be unique variables.</p><p>Players can also go beyond the lines in <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> and change the rules of engagement with <em>Battlefield Portal</em>. With this toolset, players can create or discover their own <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> experiences on the diverse and ever evolving Fort Lyndon playspace. Create a grueling battle environment with sledgehammers only, fight against the best of the best in a headshot contest or create something truly unexpected, with these powerful scripting and customization tools, all available within the Fort Lyndon sandbox for free.</p><p><strong>Season 1</strong></p><p>Starting today across all platforms, Season 1 will offer three distinct phases of content up through the holiday season. Season 1’s first phase called “Rogue Operations” launches today and features three new weapons, a new map, a new close quarters and high intensity <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [628 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode called Strikepoint, and much more. The new map Blackwell Fields is the latest large-scale all-out-war experience, set in the arid shrublands of Southern California, while the new mode Strikepoint brings <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>‘s high stakes gameplay into multiplayer with its squad-focus, one-life experience in four-versus-four combat. The mode pits small teams against each other in fast rounds, battling over a single capture point.</p><p>Season 1 also sees the release of “Rogue Operations” themed Battle Pass with 100 tiers, six total paths and 10 prestige tiers. A premium BF Pro tier and premium store content is also available today.</p><p>Two more Season 1 content releases follow this year, with California Resistance launching on November 18 and Winter Offensive launching on December 9. California Resistance includes a new map set in the suburbs of Southern California and a new mode called Sabotage where players must destroy as many sites as possible before the round ends. While Winter Offensive includes special seasonal themed content.</p><p>Seasonal content will be released on a consistent basis, adding maps, modes, weapons, and more. All gameplay-impacting features will be free or earnable as part of our commitment to fair play and access for all players. As done with <em>Battlefield Labs</em>, Battlefield Studios will continue to build both <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> with players, taking their invaluable feedback into account as these games grow and the <em>Battlefield</em> universe expands.</p></div><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/battlefield-redsec-now-available-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

These updates culminate in the full 1.0 release, which officially kicks off a new season today.</p><p><strong>What’s New in 1.0</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

By paying a small amount of Gold and entering into a contract with the Scavenger before entering Competitive (Solo, Trio) mode, you can recover your equipment if you fail to escape the dungeon.</li><li><strong>Profile Customization System</strong> – A profile system will be added, allowing you to customize your profile card. Your profile will display borders, banner images, icons, and titles. Each of these elements will be unlockable through gameplay or purchasable with currency.</li><li><strong>Season Reputation Point Reward System</strong> – “Reputation Points” will be awarded based on the sum of all Stalkers levels players achieved during the Pre-season.

There are 6 characters each with unique playstyles, movesets and gear types available immediately, with four unlockable with in-game currency and more to come as the game continues to release content to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting with each update.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Armor Destruction System</strong> – As characters take damage, this is represented visually with degraded armor and can be seen by enemy players, adding tension and strategic depth on how and when to engage.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Witch’s Curse System</strong> – The Witch’s Curse changes dungeon conditions multiple times per session. Each 5 minute phase can bestow buffs, debuffs, summon power monsters or change rules on at moment’s notice</li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – Choose between a lighter, fun and casual player-versus-environment experience or hardcore competitive player-versus-environment-versus-player dungeon run modes to suit your style and do so with teammates or solo.</li><li><strong>Play as Unique Stalkers</strong> – Select from a roster of vivid, story-driven characters with diverse abilities and discover the story behind why each of them has found themselves here and unfold the secrets to the dungeon itself!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dungeon Stalkers - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1sUqRSLbqUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/dungeon-stalkers-for-pc-now-available]]></content:encoded>
