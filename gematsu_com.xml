    <p><span>Join Section 6 in testing new technology and confidential equipment.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Virtual Revenge,” will launch on November 6, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-923899"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Besides working with Tsukishiro Yanagi from Section 6 to complete a special mission, Proxies will also be able to join Lighter from the Sons of Calydon to celebrate the Settlement Days at the Outer Ring. New gameplay including “The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault” and “Simulated Battle Trial” will be introduced in Version 1.3. Moreover, with new areas including HAND Headquarters, H.S.O.S. 6 Office, and Sān-Z STUDIO at Lumina Square being open to players, the immersive urban journey in New Eridu will be further enriched.</p><p>Led by Hoshimi Miyabi, H.S.O.S. 6 (Section 6) is an elite frontline operational unit dedicated to responding to Hollow disasters. In Version 1.3, Proxies will execute the commission requested by the Hollow Investigative Association (HIA) with Yanagi and other Section 6 members. In the meantime, following the conclusion of “Tour de Inferno,” the celebration of Settlement Days at the Outer Ring is about to begin. Proxies will be immersed in the vibrant atmosphere while savoring persistent victories with Lighter. On top of the main story, Special Episodes of Yanagi and Lighter will also be available, in which Proxies will know more about Yanagi and be able to control Lighter in a side-scrolling mode.</p><p>The new main story will feature new characters. Yanagi, the Deputy Chief of Section 6, is an S-level Electric – Anomaly Agent who can rapidly accumulate Anomaly Buildup and increase the whole team’s Disorder damage. Wielding her Naginata, Yanagi’s Ex Special Attack triggers extra Polarity Disorder which can rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies. The other powerful S-level character is Lighter, known as “The Champion” of the Sons of Calydon. He is a Fire – Stun Agent who racks up Morale and stuns enemies with a flurry of punches while lowering their Ice and Fire Resistances. Once his Morale reaches a certain level, his combat strength and skills will be reinforced. In addition, 2 new A-level Bangboo Baddieboo and Knightboo will be introduced in this new update.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_923900"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>To offer players a more varied experience, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is introducing two new gameplay modes – The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault and Simulated Battle Trial. In the roguelike The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault, there will be five chapters with each generating random environments with random Resonia and resources on the TV board for players to explore. By completing challenges, players can receive an array of in-game rewards, including Knightboo. Furthermore, players can practice their combat skills in the battle tower Simulated Battle Trial. The higher players get, the more formidable the enemies become. By reaching certain levels, players can obtain Polychromes and Badges which can be displayed on the Personal Homepage together with the newly added Titles in Version 1.3.</p><p>Additionally, a number of optimizations will be applied in Version 1.3. The functions and interface of the Compendium as well as the systems for character leveling up and upgrading will be optimized to provide a smoother experience. Players can also further decorate the 2nd floor of Random Play with the gadgets they purchase from Sān-Z STUDIO at Lumina Square. With exclusive events such as Virtual Battlefield Mayhem and When Sandwiches Come A Knockin’ coming soon, a wide range of in-game rewards await.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,253 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,566 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.3 trailer and special program below.
