        <p><em>Serpent’s Gaze</em> features handcrafted levels, with no procedural generation, best enjoyed in up to four-player cooperative play, though the game can also be played in single-player. Every run is unique thanks to a “Curse” system that applies stacking difficulty modifiers to your runs, from invading enemies, to minibosses that will hunt you down. Construct powerful builds on each run to overcome the many challenges you will face.</p><p>You play as a scion—given life by the withering tree god Magnolia, with the sole purpose of vanquishing the opposing gods and usurpers who currently rule the lands. There is only one path towards that goal—violence. But you choose how to tread that path, and along the way you’ll learn more about the secrets of the desert and the truth behind your patron in a story that subtly unfolds as you play.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Soulslike Combat With a Roguelike Twist</strong> – Choose your favorite weapon and fight tough enemies in heavy, tactical combat, with a plethora of different upgrade possibilities. Fight your way through handcrafted levels, and face the bosses—as many times as you need.</li><li><strong>Play as a Team, or Face the Challenges Alone</strong> – With support for up to 4 players, you can face the challenges of the world together with your teammates, or play at your own pace alone.</li><li><strong>Gather Blessings and Choose Your Playstyle</strong> – As you progress through levels, you find upgrades along the way—blessings from strange deities, gifts from your patron and strange relics to utilize in your pilgrimage. Choose wisely and explore endless builds and strategies.</li><li><strong>Get Cursed by the Gods, and Adapt to New Challenges</strong> – The Curse system introduces random variables every run—everything from minibosses hunting you, to environmental hazards that keep new runs fresh and challenging. The Awareness system brings even more challenges, making each successful run progressively harder.</li><li><strong>Explore an <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> Desert and Its <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>eries</strong> – Battle through imposing environments inhabited by different factions.
