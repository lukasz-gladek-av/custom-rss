Explore a large <a title="Genres > Open-World [772 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> map and sail around enchanted islands, each with their own ecosystems, treasures, resources and adventures.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Everdream Village</em> is the next evolution of <em><a title="Games > Everdream Valley [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/everdream-valley">Everdream Valley</a></em>, allowing Mooneaters to take the best parts of the original game and expand on it with new mechanics, a bigger world and deeper systems that help you connect with your cozy home, its residents and most importantly, the cute cuddly animals under your care.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sail Around and Explore Magical Islands</strong> – Set sail and explore a collection of enchanted islands, each with their own ecosystems, treasures, and resources to help you grow and expand your village. Whether you’re gathering rare flora, collecting new creatures or discovering secrets, there’s always a journey to enjoy too!</li><li><strong>Build a Living, Breathing Village</strong> – Your village isn’t just the buildings you construct, it’s a thriving community that reacts to your choices. Befriend NPCs, manage their moods, and even possibly find romance. The village you build and maintain affects how everyone feels and behaves from a variety of factors. Add decorations, care for your animals, remove pests, and so much more to make this a happy place to be.</li><li><strong>Dive Into an Animal Paradise</strong> – Interact with a massive variety of wild and domestic animals that each bring something different to the ecosystem. Breed and cross-breed animals to create unique variations of inherited traits, with hundreds of possible variations and combinations. And when the islands’ magic takes hold, transform into different animals to see the world through their eyes and maybe even cause a little mischief along the way.</li><li><strong>Make Your Farm Flourish</strong> – Turn your little village into a thriving farm! Grow crops, care for animals, and build relationships with your fellow villagers. Each has their own routines, personality, and needs. The more they like you, the more they’ll help around the place—harvesting crops, chopping wood, and even feeding your animals.</li><li><strong>Terraform the Land</strong> – Shape the world to match your vision! Raise hills, carve out rivers, or dig deep underground to uncover hidden secrets, lost treasures, and rare resources.</li><li><strong>A Sandbox of <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>s</strong> – Beyond farming and building, <em>Everdream Village</em> is packed with activities!
