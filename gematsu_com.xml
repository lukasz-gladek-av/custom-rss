Cygnus Cross showed me that not only is <em>Emberville</em> an incredibly cool idea, but they also have that detail and nuance in overflowing abundance. Their care and commitment to creating something with legacy and quality for their players is what truly makes me excited about <em>Emberville</em>. Oh, and I lied to Doug [Cockle] about him getting sausages to help get the deal across the line… don’t tell him.”</p><p>Previously revealed cast member Doug Cockle added, “The passion, skill, and experience going into the development of this game is phenomenal. I’m always attracted to projects where the team has a clear goal in mind, and the drive and knowledge to reach for it, especially when that goal pushes boundaries. That’s exciting to be part of. Plus, they told me there would be small sausages. I like small sausages.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

Since then, it served as a co-developer on <em><a title="Games > God of War Ragnarok [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a></em>. While it has not released a new game of its own, an unannounced live service game from Bluepoint Games <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sony-interactive-entertainment-cancels-live-service-games-from-bluepoint-games-and-bend-studio">was canceled</a> in January 2025, which was reportedly a <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> game that began development in 2022.</p><p>Here is the full email to employees from Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst on the studio’s closure, via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes-is-shutting-down.1440826/" target="_blank">ResetEra</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to share an important update from the Studio Business.</p><p>As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,624 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios. <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a></em> launched to critical and commercial success, <em><a title="Games > Death Stranding 2: On the Beach [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>&nbsp;and <em>MLB The Show</em> continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p><p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p><p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p><p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for fiscal year 26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead.</p><p>Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p><p>Best,<br>Hermen Hulst<br>CEO, Studio Business Group</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-shut-down-bluepoint-games]]></content:encoded>
