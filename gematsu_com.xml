      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Day 4 Night [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/day-4-night">Day 4 Night</a>, the studio founded by <em><a title="Games > Red Dead Redemption [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> lead designer and writer Christian Cantamessa, and <em>Mario + Rabbids</em> series creative director Davide Soliani, has announced genre-bending action <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,780 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Bradley the Badger" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bradley-the-badger">Bradley the Badger</a></em>. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, “with the team exploring additional platforms and consoles.” A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1013516"></span></p><p>“Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them,” said Day 4 Night Studios co-founder Christian Cantamessa in a press release. “Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in.”</p><p>Co-founder Davide Soliani added, “We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine. And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Day 4 Night:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Bradley the Badger</em> is a love letter to games. It’s an action adventure that blends exploration, traversal and mind-bending freeform puzzles, all brought to life through a satirical narrative that features moments in live-action.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A beloved platforming icon wakes up to a world that no longer makes sense. Longing to return home, Bradley embarks on a journey to save his world and his friends at all costs, even if that means coming face to face with a revelation bigger than anything he ever imagined.</p><p>Across wildly different playable worlds, “inspired” by famous games but stuck in development hell, you’ll experience a unique narrative told through the enthusiastic, curious, and endlessly playful eyes of a videogame mascot. Will Bradley rescue Dreamwoods?</p><p><strong>Core Gameplay: An <a title="Genres > Action [3,278 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-Adventure Like No Other</strong></p><p>You will explore, double-jump, solve challenges, fight with your trusted frying pan across unfinished game worlds that are very much in need of a creative spark. Maybe that’s what you’ll contribute to save the day? There will be items to collect, quests to answer, secrets to unravel. And as much as Bradley would hope that this is gaming as usual, things will definitely be unlike anything he has ever experienced.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1014182"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Kit</strong></p><p>At the heart of our game is the Kit. It’s a tool that lets Bradley modify every unfinished asset he can find, just as if he was a game developer. It’s systemic, immediate, and completely transforms how you approach exploration, traversal, puzzles, and combat. It might even change the way you think about this game.</p><p>Here are some functions you’ll unlock:</p><ul><li><strong>Scale</strong> – Shrink or enlarge unfinished objects to open new paths, crush enemies, and redesign the environment.</li><li><strong>Transfer</strong> – Assume control of every unfinished asset in the world (anything from a toy robot to a car) to gain new abilities and movement options.</li><li><strong>Tessellate</strong> – Make walls temporarily climbable to reach secret routes and vantage points.</li><li><strong>Explosive</strong> – Turn innocuous objects into bombs, hazards into opportunities, and enemies into debris.</li><li><strong>Extrude</strong> – Push or pull geometry from unfinished surfaces to create your own platforms, paths, and cover.</li><li><strong>Manipulator</strong> – Grab, rotate and stack unfinished objects as if they were building blocks to solve problems in your own way.</li></ul><p>And many more! Additional powers like COPY, GRAVITY, LIQUIFY and even the ability to DEBUG await, as Bradley pushes forward in his quest.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
