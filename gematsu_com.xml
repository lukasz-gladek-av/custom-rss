I’m happy to say that we cooked on this.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We didn’t just lazily scale up enemy stats and call it a day, we’ve added new moves to bosses, some new items, and oh yeah, remixed almost every enemy encounter in the game. You’ll even be able to upgrade your fork and stowaway weight even higher. Have you ever wanted FOUR stowaway slots? NG+ has FOUR stowaway slots. PLUS we’ve also added new exclusive stowaways for NG+, the Sigils.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Another-Crabs-Treasure_04-07-25_002.png"></a></figure><p>oOooOooOoohmysteriouswhatdotheydooooo</p><p>Outside of New Game Plus…</p><p><strong>Refight Bosses</strong></p><p>You’ll now have the chance to go back to your favorite boss fights and get your shell handed to you through COMBAT MEMORIES.
