You’re a brilliant but tormented operant on a desperate assignment. Pick up the pieces of your broken network, untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History, and prove yourself on the big stage or blow it all up—again.</p><p><strong>A Spy Like No Other</strong></p><p>Brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed—you play as operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE. Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you’ve been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate. If they don’t go your way (and they won’t), you’ll have to improvise and hope the consequences are ones you can live with.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong> – Play as Hershel—brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to ash. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li><li><strong>Espionage Reinvented</strong> – Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment. Cope with the terror of reality by giving up parts of yourself and try not to lose your mind in the process.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p>Hey, Bub. We know it’s been a minute, so let’s cut to the chase: <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> is set to launch on PlayStation 5 consoles in Fall 2026, and we have a brand-new trailer just for you. </p><p>Additionally, we’re proud to include Descriptive Audio for the trailer. This is available in the video settings under Audio track.</p><p>Not only do we have a new trailer, but we’re also revealing the game’s cover art! Our cover bridges bold simplicity with the expressive energy of comics to further accentuate Wolverine’s rugged, complex personality.</p><p>Our <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> cover art, designed in collaboration with renowned comic artist Jock.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>He’s the best at what he does…</strong></p><p>Bold, resilient, and volatile, Wolverine is a character that all of us at Insomniac are thrilled to explore in collaboration with our friends at Marvel Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment. Like our <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> franchise, we’re once again combining our super powers to deliver an original take on a beloved character based on Marvel Comics.</p><p>Our Wolverine, <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">AKA</a> Logan, is played by actor Liam McIntyre who taps into the rage, pain, and nuances of this iconic character. In this story, he is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him. Unfortunately, in this world, he’ll have to dig his claws deep to pull any shred of information that may lead to answers. Often, that means shredding into a relentless onslaught of enemies who aim to stop him by any means necessary. Fueled by unflinching resilience (and a rapid healing factor), Wolverine won’t go down easy if it means keeping the mission on task.</p><p><strong>…But What He Does Best Isn’t Very Nice </strong></p><p>Logan is the quintessential reluctant hero – haunted by the consequences of unleashing the beast within. Once the claws come out, Wolverine doesn’t hold back: as a living weapon forged against his will, he’ll use razor-sharp adamantium to dispatch enemies and untamed berserker rage to build momentum on the battlefield. He’ll leave an impression on his foes with fast, fluid, and rapid attacks and techniques that’ll dismember or break anyone who gets in his way. Wolverine might be distant, but he isn’t afraid to get up-close and personal when it counts.</p><p><strong>A Dark Past Threatens to Consume Him </strong></p><p>Independence is often the way of Wolverine, although keen-eyed fans may have spotted some of the familiar faces he’ll encounter on his journey, like the elusive <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ique or the brutish Omega Red. Some will fight alongside Logan against all odds and others will unleash all-out attacks on our hero, such as the Reavers, one of our enemy factions, who will keep our hero’s instincts on edge. Speaking of which, our trailer concludes with a prototype of an iconic-yet-menacing purple robot. </p><p>In this global thriller, Wolverine’s search for answers will send him on perilous excursions to exotic locales, including the island nation of Madripoor, the frosted wilderness of Canada, and the narrow city streets of Tokyo – all potential battlegrounds for fierce, bloody, destructive <a title="Genres > Action [3,066 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p><strong>Unmask the Heart of a Hero</strong></p><p><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> is built from the ground up for PlayStation 5 consoles. Injecting our Super Hero know-how into this new <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,580 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, this is an original take on Logan and his iconic adamantium-centric skillset… that’s a fancy way of saying “claws.”</p><p>We aim to deliver the ultimate Wolverine fantasy built on Insomniac staples like fast, fluid, and ferocious combat; exhilarating, action-packed set pieces; robust accessibility features; and a gripping story that taps into the core tenets of one of the most compelling comic book characters of all-time. We’re breaking new ground with Wolverine, yes, but our penchant for telling stories about heroes overcoming colossal odds is as strong as ever. We’re eager to explore Logan’s story with you and tap into his signature spin on heroism, which is much darker and more brutal than you might expect from Insomniac.</p><p>You can slice into all of the action when <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> launches on PlayStation 5 consoles in fall 2026. But we won’t keep you in suspended anticipation; keep your eyes peeled and your claws sharp for more information on <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> in Spring 2026.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer and a behind the scenes video below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/marvels-wolverine-launches-in-fall-2026]]></content:encoded>
