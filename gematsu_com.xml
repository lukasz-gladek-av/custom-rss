    <p><span>Rescue lives, unveil the truth behind the catastrophe, and reignite hope with the Coreflame.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne,” will launch on February 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-944235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers and their companions will forge ahead on the grand Flame-Chase Journey, venturing into uncharted territories and embracing a tapestry of thrilling events. Adding brilliance to the adventure are two new playable characters, Tribbie and Mydei, each weaving their unique threads into the ever-unfolding saga.</p><p>In the previous chapter, Nikador’s Coreflame was successfully reclaimed. Yet, the Flame-Chase Journey remains a race against time. With this pivotal milestone achieved, preparations for the next step are already underway. In Version 3.1, the Trailblazer will take on the role of a messenger, embarking alongside their companions to a brand-new map, “Grove of Epiphany,” where the journey continues with renewed purpose.</p><p>The Grove of Epiphany, a revered city-state honoring Cerces, the Reason Titan, stands as Amphoreus’ cradle of knowledge and maintains strong ties with Okhema. Known for its vital academic contributions to the Flame-Chase Journey, the Grove has long provided critical research on the black tide and Titans, serving as a beacon of enlightenment and progress. Cerces, like Kephale, harbors goodwill toward humanity and, with boundless generosity, transformed the Grove into a sanctuary for knowledge seekers, offering rest, study, and the wisdom of the world to mortals once shrouded in ignorance. However, this haven of learning has recently fallen to the black tide’s assault. Amidst the ensuing chaos, a shadowy foe has emerged, seeking to claim Cerces’ Coreflame for their own. In the Version 3.1 Trailblaze Mission, Trailblazers must rise to the challenge, rescuing survivors, uncovering truths about the catastrophe, and reclaiming Cerces’ Coreflame to restore hope to Okhema.</p><p>Moreover, in Version 3.1’s Main Story, Trailblazers will harness the power of Oronyx to awaken echoes of the past, leading them to a new map where the “Abyss of Fate,” once known as “Janusopolis,” stands in its Day State. Along the way, they will uncover long-buried secrets from the “Era Chrysea,” gradually unveiling the mysterious past of Tribbie, the latest 5-star playable character.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

As a 5-star Imaginary character following the Path of Destruction, in battle, Mydei fully utilizes his undying nature to fight the enemies. With a mass of Max HP, he can consume HP to charge, and then enter an enhanced form. When enhanced, Mydei automatically strikes enemies in his turn, dealing greater DMG and showcasing the might of the crown prince in Castrum Kremnos.Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Yunli and Huohuo will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.In addition to new characters and storylines, Version 3.1 brings an array of exciting events. One highlight is the new season of Divergent Universe, which introduces a brand-new research topic centered on Amphoreus. This time, battles will feature the innovative "Day and Night System," where combat alternates between day and night. Each state provides unique boosts, while transitions between them trigger additional effects. Furthermore, the Day and Night System, along with its associated Blessings, is deeply connected to the Titans and the Chrysos Heirs, adding layers of strategy and lore to the experience. Additionally, Trailblazers will take part in The Awooo Firm event, where players step into the role of manager to assist the chimera squad in Okhema. By providing guidance and support, Trailblazers will help the squad turn their fortunes around and rise to become the strongest team of all.<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,864 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.
