The high-definition remaster is based on the PC game from 2018, but features some important additions: All graphics have been improved in high definition, the controls have been reworked, and there is a leveling system: the more items you collect, the stronger you get, but also the opponents will get more resilient, and the hordes will get bigger… Ahem, anyway, enter one of the Striker airplanes or the Zeppelin with an aerial mine launcher and fight your way through seven complex stages full of well-balanced euro-shmup action. In short: a remaster—restored with love!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/the-legend-of-steel-empire-for-ps4-launches-october-9]]></content:encoded>
