Is someone watching you? Are they there with you? Is this perhaps just a dream? You’re never quite sure.</p><p>Developed by Tensori, a team of four in Finland, <em>POOLS</em> became an unexpected phenomenon after its debut. It went on to win the “Best Creative Achievement of the Year” at the Finnish Game Awards, earned a 95 percent “Overwhelmingly Positive” rating on Steam, and allowed the developers at Tensori to turn their passion project into a sustainable studio.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>PlayStation 5 players will be able to play the original <em>POOLS</em> game and the “Chapter 0” expansion, both in flatscreen and on PlayStation VR2.

        <p><strong>Crimson Dusk</strong></p><p>The developer of this game is the Taiwanese indie team Crimson Dusk, formed in May 2020. In 2018, Sam revealed the prototype of <em>Homura Hime</em>, a project he started on his own while he was a student, at a contest. It received a lot of positive feedback, and from there, Crimson Dusk was formed.</p><p><strong>Stage Showcase</strong></p><p>The very first stage of the game is Adashino, a beautiful place surrounded by greenery but covered in graves and Jizo statues. Here, Homura Hime will have to traverse the terrain with all of the basic actions she’s learned. At the end of the stage, she will have to face the archdemon Agasa, who takes the form of a young girl, in a terrifying battle.</p><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>Welcome to a world where humans and demons coexist. Souls harboring strong emotions and deep regrets at their time of death are transformed into archdemons. Archdemons have the power to corrupt the foundation of the world and contaminate their surroundings. Creatures tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters that operate solely on raw instinct.</p><p>Faced with the threat to the world posed by five extremely powerful demon girls, the High Priestess is forced to dispatch Homura Hime—the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist of them all—and her aide, Ann, who are now entrusted with the divine mission of purifying the world and defeating all demons.</p></blockquote><p>Watch some new footage below.</p><h2><span>PLAYISM Game Show: September 16, 2025</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZQzbmxMmZE?&amp;t=20</p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ6ryGqboUY?&amp;t=20</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/homura-hime-launches-this-winter]]></content:encoded>
