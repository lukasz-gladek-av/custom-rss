      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Super Rare Originals [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/super-rare-originals">Super Rare Originals</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Wallride [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/wallride">Wallride</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Grandma, No!" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grandma-no">Grandma, No!</a></em>, a physics-based <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,001 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> where players become a grandma and take on her day-to-day house chores in chaotic fashion. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362680/Grandma_No/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025. <span id="more-939390"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Super Rare Originals:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Grandma, No!</em>, it’s up to the player to keep things under control, or the house turns into a whirlwind of chaos; a range of challenges and scenarios that need to be resolved await. What chaos ensues when Grandma gets stuck babysitting her grandkid out of the blue?</p><p><em>Grandma, No!</em> is a physics-based, laugh-out-loud adventure where the player steps into the worn-out slippers of a grandma who’s in way over her head. She is trying to survive her day without burning the house down—or maybe she’ll embrace the mayhem.</p><p>The gameplay takes a turn when “simple” tasks go off the rails. Taking out the trash may lead to somewhere unexpected, while cooking dinner could end up with more fire than flavor. Each challenge is designed to be wilder than the last, and new outfits for Grandma can be unlocked along the way, so she can tackle the mayhem in style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
