Just sign in with your Steam account and your entire library is there.</p><p><strong>There’s an LED Strip, Y’all!</strong></p><p>Keep tabs on system status like download progress, even when your screen is off. Customize it with different colors and animations. Or turn it off!</p><p><strong>Optimized for Gaming…</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It Runs SteamOS</strong> – Steam Machine runs Valve’s gaming-first operating system. SteamOS is designed to provide a plug-and-play user experience, while keeping the power and flexibility of a <a title="Platforms > PC [24,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> SteamOS in the same way as other Steam hardware, like Steam Deck and Steam Frame.</li><li><strong>Steam Machine Verified</strong> – We are expanding our Verified program to include ratings for Steam Machine, so customers can understand how their games will run.</li></ul><p><strong>…and it’s a PC</strong></p><p>Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it’s still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer?</p><p><strong>Steam Machine Plays Well, Wherever Steam is</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Made for Steam Controller</strong> – Steam Machine comes with a built-in wireless adapter, just for pairing with Steam Controller. (Up to four with a single adapter!) This means you can pair your Steam Controller without its puck, and you can wake your Steam Machine without leaving your couch.</li><li><strong>Great for Streaming</strong> – With enough horsepower to take on the most demanding games, Steam Machine is the perfect host PC for streaming to other devices. Easily stream to your Steam Deck, Steam Frame, or any other device running Steam or Steam Link.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>SteamOS</strong> – An OS optimized for gaming, with fast suspend/resume, and cloud saves. And that’s just the start.</li><li><strong>Small Form Factor</strong> – Put it under your TV. Set it on your desk. Hide it under a banana. It’s powerful PC gaming packed into a roughly 6-inch (~160mm) cube.</li><li><strong>Cool and Quiet</strong> – Steam Machine keeps cool and runs whisper-quiet, even while running the most demanding games.</li><li><strong>I/O for Days</strong> – Ready for all the peripherals and monitors you can throw* at it: 1 Gigabit Ethernet. DisplayPort 1.4. HDMI 2.0. One USB-C and four USB-A ports. *But, like, don’t actually throw things at it.</li><li><strong>CPU and GPU</strong> – 4K gaming at 60 frames per second with FSR, thanks to a discrete semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> – Available in two storage sizes: 512GB and 2TB. Both come with expandable storage via microSD.</li><li><strong>Connectivity</strong> – 2×2 Wi-Fi 6E, plus Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna. Steam Controller’s wireless adapter is built right into Steam Machine for direct pairing.</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – No giant brick!

Step into immersive VR, or lean back and enjoy your non-VR catalog. And it supports stand-alone play too.</p><p><strong>Designed for Comfort. Easy to Use</strong></p><p>The Steam Frame headset is lightweight and compact, with the weight balanced front-to-rear for a comfortable experience. It’s also easy to just slip on and play, with no wires and no setup.</p><p><strong>A High Quality Streaming-First Experience</strong></p><p>Streaming can be highly variable, so we prioritized making Steam Frame a stable, high quality streaming experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Wireless Adapter and Dual Radios</strong> – The included plug-and-play 6GHz wireless adapter provides a dedicated link for both VR and non-VR streaming. Steam Frame’s dual radios make this connection even more stable: One radio is dedicated to streaming the audio and visuals, and the other connects to your Wi-Fi. Two dedicated links, no competition for bandwidth.</li><li><strong>Introducing Foveated Streaming</strong> – Foveated Streaming is a new feature that optimizes detail where your eyes are looking, and typically offers over a 10x improvement in image quality and effective bandwidth. Behind the scenes, we’re using low-latency eye tracking data to steer the best quality pixels only to where you’re looking. This is all happening without you noticing, and works for your entire Steam library.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Jump Right Into Your Games</strong> – Just wake up the headset, and you’re gaming. No fuss, no setup; just games</li><li><strong>Who Wants Pancakes?</strong> – Thin and light custom pancake lenses provide edge-to-edge sharpness and a large eye box. Optics feature 2160 x 2160 LCD panels, one per eye. Supported refresh rates are 72-144Hz.</li><li><strong>Seamless Audio Experience</strong> – Steam Frame has high fidelity audio via dual stereo speakers on each side. The speakers within each pair are oriented in opposite directions to cancel out vibrations, which can be a tracking system buzzkill.</li><li><strong>Camera Tracking</strong> – No setup required. Four high-resolution, monochrome cameras provide controller and headset tracking. Infrared LEDs on the outside make tracking great even in dark environments.</li><li><strong>Controllers for All Your Games</strong> – Hop between your VR and non-VR games. Steam Frame Controllers are designed with a split gamepad layout to work with your whole Steam library.</li><li><strong>The VR Inputs You’d Expect…</strong> – Steam Frame controllers are tracked in space by the headset, and come with all the inputs needed for your VR games. Capacitive finger tracking enhances immersion. These controls are fully backwards compatible and support the full SteamVR catalog.</li><li><strong>…And Inputs for Non-VR Games, Too</strong> – The Steam Frame controllers also have all the familiar inputs you need to play non-VR games: D-pad, ABXY, thumbsticks, triggers, and bumpers, all right where you’d expect them.</li><li><strong>Magnetic Thumbsticks</strong> – Steam Frame includes next-generation magnetic thumbsticks for precision and capacitive finger sensing. These are the same thumbsticks included in Steam Controller.</li><li><strong>Easy Battery Access</strong> – Each Steam Frame controller runs on a single AA battery, offering ~40 hours of play time.</li></ul><p><strong>Supports Standalone Play, Too</strong></p><p>Steam Frame is a PC, and runs SteamOS powered by a Snapdragon 8 Series Processor. With 16GB of RAM, Steam Frame supports stand-alone play on a growing number of both VR and non-VR games without needing to stream from your PC.</p><p><strong>Steam Frame is a PC</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It Runs SteamOS</strong> – Quick suspend / resume. Cloud saves. All the features of SteamOS that make for a great user experience are now available in VR. Just like any SteamOS device, install your own apps, open a browser, do what you want: It’s your PC.</li><li><strong>Steam Frame Verified, for Standalone Games</strong> – Just like Steam Deck and Steam Machine, Steam Frame will have a verified program that helps you see which games in your library (VR and non-VR) will work stand-alone.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, There’s a Developer Kit!</strong></p><p>Hi devs! We want a great experience on Steam Frame for as many Steam games as possible, whether it’s via streaming or stand-alone. We’re opening up a Steam Frame Developer Kit program to help.</p><p>The more developers with Steam Frames in hand, the more feedback we can grab; and the better we can make Proton and SteamOS and improve compatibility for the entire Steam library. You can request a Steam Frame developer kit in your Steam partner dashboard. Supplies are limited, but we will be sending out kits on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Steam Frame Plays Well, Wherever Steam Is</strong></p><p>Your Steam Frame headset easily pairs with your Steam Controller; you’ll even see a virtual Steam Controller floating in your VR space.
