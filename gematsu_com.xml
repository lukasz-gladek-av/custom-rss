      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: The Edge of <a title="Series > Fate [66 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a></em> expansion will launch on July 15, <a title="Companies > Bungie [226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Rite of the Nine,” is available today. A second expansion, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and titled <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>, will launch in December. <span id="more-963278"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Release Schedule</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody><thead><!-- AD: content -->
        <tr><th>Release</th><th>Release Date</th><th>Availability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rite of the Nine</td><td>May 6, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Core Game updates</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td>Ash &amp; Iron (major update)</td><td>September 9, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>December 2, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow &amp; Order (major update)</td><td>March 3, 2026</td><td>Available to all</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em></strong></p><p>When <em>The Edge of Fate</em> releases on July 15, players will be reintroduced to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, and face a new threat that predates everything Guardians know about Sol. Two major characters will step into the spotlight: Lodi, a new ally from a distant place, and the legendary Warlock Vanguard Ikora. <em>The Edge of Fate</em> will propel Guardians into a multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions.</p><p>The expansion will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeons and destination design, which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery. New enemies, weapons, gear, and destination-specific abilities await those brave enough to dive into its secrets.</p><p>A key feature of Kepler is the abundant dark matter energy, which powers the abilities available to the Guardian while exploring the destination. The new Matterspark ability allows Guardians to bind to dark matter to change forms, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces, jump and dash across terrain, and become a rolling force of destruction. Additional abilities include the new Relocator Cannon, which uses Fallen dark matter tech to teleport players across the environment, and Mattermorph, which lets Guardians manipulate their surroundings using the combined forces of dark matter and Strand.</p><p>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Campaign</li><li>New Raid</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li></ul><p>Year of Prophecy Edition Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> and <em>Renegades</em> Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li></ul><p>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition Pre-Order includes:</p><ul><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> and <em>Renegades</em> Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li>Instant Unlock Exotic Sniper Rifle: New Land Beyond<ul><li>New Land Beyond Ornament and Catalyst (available at launch of <em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em>)</li></ul></li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li><em>The Edge of Fate</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li><em>Renegades</em> Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Emote (instant unlock)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Sparrow (available July 15, 2025)</li><li>Dark Side Legends Bundle (3 full armor ornament sets, 1 for each class, instant unlock)</li><li>Secret Stash (1x Exotic Cosmetic, 1x Exotic Cipher, 2x Ascendant Alloys, 3x Ascendant Shards, delivered with each seasonal update)</li></ul><p>The <em>Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Collector’s Edition</em> is also available for pre-order on the Bungie Store.
