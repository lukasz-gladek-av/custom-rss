So many developers now seem almost embarrassed to embrace the media that’s inspired them, whether out of legal concerns or fear of being called derivative. I’d rather make something derivative than something insincere.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Akupara Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Visually inspired by Urusei Yatursa and set in an alternate 1989 Empire of Japan, play as Himari Sanada, a barista thrust into a deadly game alongside fifteen other Absolute students.
