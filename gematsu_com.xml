    <p><span>"These changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before."</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Microsoft Gaming has begun the process of widespread layoffs that have been expected since last week, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a> by Jason Schreier. <span id="more-977367"></span></p><p><a title="Companies > Activision [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> subsidiary and <em>Candy Crush</em> developer King, will cut 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans.</p><p>Other European offices, such as <a title="Companies > ZeniMax Media [822 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, will also face job cuts.</p><p>United States-based subsidiaries are expected to be told how many jobs will be cut at each office later today.</p><p>The move marks the fourth mass layoff at Microsoft Gaming in the last 18 months.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a>, Microsoft as a whole is expected to lay off as much as four percent of its workforce, or roughly 9,000 employees. It is unclear how many employees will be affected across Microsoft Gaming.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Central</a> also shared the following note from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer sent to staff this morning:</p><blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p><p>—Phil</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/microsoft-to-lay-off-thousands-of-staff-including-at-microsoft-gaming]]></content:encoded>
