This explorable hub area blends quiet moments of preparation with new layers of storytelling. Here, you’ll meet <a title="Games > Dew" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dew">Dew</a>, the mysterious goddess who guides your journey, and interact with new NPCs that offer quests, gear upgrades, auctions, and essential services. Invite friends, form parties, and strategize before calling upon Soekja to summon the boat that will carry you into the Gyldenmist.</li><li><strong>New Class Path, Blasphemer Seers</strong> – The once-divine Seers now splinter. While some remain faithful, others walk a new path. Blasphemer Seers reject the Goddess of Light and channel their suffering into brutal close-quarters combat. Wielding maces infused with elemental devastation, they unleash a Special State that fuels explosive burst damage and savage flanking strikes. It’s a violent rebuke of divinity—and a deadly asset in the right hands.</li><li><strong>New Boss: General Harald</strong> – Prepare for an unforgettable boss encounter—General Harald, former hero of Brandrgarde. Once a revered commander, his soul was lost in a desperate experiment to stop the Gyldenmist. Now, twisted by madness and power, Harald guards the ruins as a relentless executioner. Only the most fearless Gyldhunters will survive him—and claim the treasures he protects.</li><li><strong>Playable Female Characters and Customization Debut</strong> – The female versions of all five core classes—Sorcerer, Black Arrow, Shadowstrix, Mercenary, and Seer—are now fully playable. Alongside this long-awaited feature, Beta 3 introduces the first wave of character customization, giving players more freedom to define their identity in the Age of Corrosion.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mistfall Hunter</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pn5wjm7v6m0" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->
