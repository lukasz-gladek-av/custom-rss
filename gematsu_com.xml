    <p><span>Season 2 begins alongside Xbox Series release.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Where Clouds Embrace the Dawn,” will launch on June 6, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [196 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. As <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/zenless-zone-zero-for-xbox-series-launches-in-june-alongside-version-2-0-update">previously announced</a>, the <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,236 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> versions will launch alongside version 2.0. <span id="more-966809"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game’s first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes.</p><p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, players will embark on an exhilarating new journey in Waifei Peninsula, a remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu. Guided by Yi Xuan, the High Preceptor of Yunkui Summit, Proxies will further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether. The region’s main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere. Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple’s facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows.</p><p>The Lemnian Hollow is an area rich in resources, yet fraught with danger. Due to the perilous Miasma widespread in the Hollow, formidable foes will enter the Miasmic Field state under certain conditions, gaining shields and enhanced abilities. To counter this, several powerful allies will join the roster. Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent. With her unique Attribute Auric Ink and Specialty Rupture, Yixuan ignores enemies’ Defense and deals all damage based on her Sheer Force, which can be increased according to her Attack and Max HP. She also utilizes a special mechanic called Adrenaline instead of just regular Energy, and possesses 2 distinct Ultimate modes for varied combat scenarios, bringing Void Hunter-level prowess to the team. Joining Yixuan is Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent. Ju Fufu and her mighty weapon Hu Wei can accumulate Might and Momentum points to deal both Physical and Fire damage. Her Chain Attack grants the entire team the Tiger’s Roar effect, boosting the squad’s CRIT DMG as well as the damage of Chain Attacks and Ultimates.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_966810"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Also stepping into the spotlight is Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit’s A-Rank Physical Defense Agent, who proves that even a kitchen-savvy panda can be a force to reckon with. Completing the squad is Belion, an S-Rank Bangboo from Yunkui Summit. Meanwhile, the S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p><p>Apart from new narrative and characters, Hollow Zero: Lost Void will also be updated with new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles. In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector. In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards.</p><p>To support more convenient exploration across the expanded New Eridu and Hollows, Version 2.0 will introduce a brand-new 3D map and enhanced navigation features. The newly implemented Fissure Beacons will allow Proxies to restore HP, revive Agents, and teleport, allowing Proxies to resume combat more efficiently. Furthermore, new players who complete Season 1 Chapter 2 Interlude can directly unlock and switch to Season 2’s main storyline.</p><p>Beyond new content and optimizations, Version 2.0 will deliver generous anniversary rewards in appreciation of the players’ continued support. Proxies will be able to choose one S-Rank Agent and one S-Rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free, along with receiving 1,600 Polychromes, as well as an anniversary-exclusive title and avatar upon the Version 2.0 release. Furthermore, players can also obtain a variety of in-game rewards, including 20 Encrypted Master Tapes, 10 Boopons, and new Outfits for the protagonists by completing specific challenges and event commissions.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,523 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

Determined, willful and stubborn, Dante has an incredibly strong sense of justice which occasionally brings out her prideful nature.</li><li><strong>Beatrice Portinari</strong> – Ardently dedicated to her purpose in overseeing Dante’s climb to Paradiso, her heart is set on securing her beloved’s salvation and keeping her from straying—whatever the cost. For Beatrice, one’s vows are eternal and her duty to protect and guide Dante prevails over any and every hardship.</li><li><strong>Virgil Pablias Vergilias Maro</strong> – Bubbly and full of energy, Virgil is endlessly devoted to her loved ones—an affectionate and kind soul despite her occasional bouts of mischievousness. A long term resident of Limbo, she’s immensely secretive about her past. With love conquers all as her motto, Virgil will go above and beyond to reach her goals even if it means going against the most powerful forces in Hell.</li><li><strong>Ovid Pablias Ovidias Naso</strong> – With the <a title="Platforms > Meta [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>morphoses as her magnum opus, Ovid resides in the Forum amongst her fellow Poets of Limbo. Demanding and outspoken, she spends her eternity antagonizing others while seeking the attention of her beloved, Virgil. While self-assured and confident, Ovid is terribly afraid of the dark and dislikes discussing the circumstances of her past life.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the trailer below.
