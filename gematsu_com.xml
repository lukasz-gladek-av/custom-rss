    <p><span>The grand finale of the Sacrifice crisis.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Bury Your Tears With the Past,” will launch on April 23, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-957540"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.7 “Bury Your Tears with the Past” will deliver a riveting finale to Season 1’s story. The long-sought truth behind the Sacrifice crisis will finally come to light as Proxies delve into Vivian’s shadowed past and unravel the mysteries behind Hugo’s demise. Amidst the turmoil in New Eridu, a Void Hunter-rank special investigator—assigned by the Mayor—will join forces with Proxies to confront the encroaching darkness, while vibrant in-game events weave moments of joy and cheer into the thrilling and dangerous journey.</p><p>After Hugo’s fall into the Hollow, tensions between Mockingbird and TOPS continue to escalate, and deeper secrets await revelation in this chapter. Partnering with Vivian, Proxies will infiltrate enemy territory to search for the Sacrifice Core, unearth the mysterious past she shares with certain old acquaintances of hers, and expose the Exaltists’ conspiracy. With a formidable new ally, the Sacrifice crisis comes to a climax, finally unveiling the truth behind all the chaos.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_957541"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mockingbird’s two S-Rank Agents bring elegance and precision to the battlefield. Vivian, an Ether Anomaly Agent, dances across the battlefield with a parasol and rapier, seamlessly shifting between grounded and aerial attacks. Her Basic Attack: Featherbloom amplifies Anomaly damage and synergizes with allies’ EX Special Attacks to boost the team’s Corruption damage. Hugo, an Ice Attack Agent, wields a suitcase that transforms into a sharp scythe, carving through enemies with slashes and devastating area sweeps. When hitting stunned enemies, Hugo can trigger the Totalize effect, elevating his damage based on the enemies’ remaining stun duration. Joining them is Robin, Mockingbird’s agile Bangboo companion, who pelts enemies with randomized cards that have various effects. Additionally, the Physical Anomaly Agent Jane and the Fire Stun Agent Lighter will rerun in this version’s banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Beyond the battlefield, Version 1.7 invites Proxies to unwind or embrace new challenges through in-game events. In “Say It With Flowers,” players step into the role of a flower shop manager, crafting gorgeous floral arrangements for different clients. By completing floral design commissions, Proxies will unlock a permanent interactive floral arrangement gameplay for Quality Time mode and receive exclusive rewards, including A-Rank Bangboo Overtimeboo. For thrill-seekers, the adrenaline-fueled Bangboo Bash returns with a ranked mode. Proxies can compete in obstacle and survival courses, earning points based on match placement and rank. Those who ascend the leaderboards can claim exclusive event titles, Polychromes, and other rewards.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.
