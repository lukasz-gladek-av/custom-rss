A release date was not announced, but the first public playtest is currently live from now until October 1. <span id="more-996704"></span></p><p>“I’ve seen members of the Wired team transform from quiet and measured souls, into mouth frothing and evil laughing demons while playtesting <em>Task Time</em>,” said Wired Productions managing director Leo Zullo in a press release. “That is enough for me to know ReadGraves have delivered a wonderfully chaotic party game.”</p><p>ReadGraves founder Sam Read-Graves added, “We made <em>Task Time</em> to see what happens when you throw a gameshow, a physics engine and all your friends into a blender. <em>Task Time</em> is competitive, chaotic and completely unpredictable, where no two rounds are ever the same. It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we’re really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make <em>WarioWare</em> but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”</p><div id="carousel_996988"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Task Time</em> challenges up to eight players to compete across six frantic gameshow-inspired rounds where sabotage is encouraged, friendships are tested, and laughter is guaranteed.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Developed by some of the creative talent who worked on hit <a title="Genres > Party [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">party games</a> <em><a title="Games > Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout">Fall Guys</a></em> and <em>Gang Beasts</em>, <em>Task Time</em> is a physics-driven party game where randomly generated tasks and player-versus-player gameplay erupt into unpredictable chaos.</p><p><em>Task Time</em> is built for unpredictable fun. Across six chaotic rounds, Tasklings can complete over 500,000 random task variations. One moment you might be solving puzzles, the next you’re blasting your mates with paintballs or scrambling across a collapsing map as the floor turns to lava. Whether you win or lose, every match is a story: ridiculous comebacks, glorious failures, and moments of sabotage you’ll be laughing about long after the round ends.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of gameplay videos below.

When we started working on <em><a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a></em> in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of an adventurer’s life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With <em>Outward</em> 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our downloadable content. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer’s life. Much better graphics, better immersion and better combat.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nine Dots Studio:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The original <em>Outward</em>, which eclipsed three million players earlier this month, challenged conventional <a title="Genres > Open-World [741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,679 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> by trading the typical power fantasy for an adventure that demands preparation, persistence, and tactical execution. <em>Outward 2</em> takes the formula that gathered a dedicated community and injects it with new and enhanced features fueled by the same intention and effort the developers ask of its players as they embark.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>An Average Joe On A Remarkable Journey</strong> – You’re not a hero of legend. Shape your modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, which will determine where to start in this brutal world. Whether you’re a devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon’s Bastion, the world of Aurai will not be kind… not even in defeat. If you’re knocked out, your journey continues, and you must live with the consequences. You could be robbed and left to rot, be saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or… worse.</li><li><strong>A Living, Evolving World</strong> – A full-year seasonal cycle transforms the world of Aurai. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. Comprising of four distinct areas, regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. From the blizzards of the Gilded Mountains to the acid rains in the Gathes of Catharsis, players will find a renewed challenge every time they travel.</li><li><strong>Growth Through <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>tery</strong> – Every factor in <em>Outward 2</em> molds your playstyle. Your tactical choices as a player, from the weight and material of your armor to particular weapons you use, are reinforced by the new <a title="Genres > Exercise [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/exercise">Exercise</a> system, where passive skills will spark and grow based on how you play. Seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai, who will teach you how to survive the most brutal encounters for a fee.</li><li><strong>Ritual Spellcasting and Tactical Combat</strong> – Wielding magic in <em>Outward 2</em> is no mere button press. Cast spells through rituals, like sending a fire stone into the air to create a ring around you that allows you to empower your skills with deadly flames. Challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset, is further enhanced in the sequel with a larger variety of tools and weapon combinations, along with animations that bring more fluidity and control to players. Major combat improvements were cultivated based on extensive player feedback from the original.</li><li><strong>Intentional Inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> -Your backpack is your lifeline, and every space within is worth its weight in gold. Pack provisions, potions, weapons, and camping gear for an expedition, but manage it carefully as you gather more along the way. Some discoveries won’t be worth the precious space. In a fight, you may want to drop your backpack to attack and evade more deftly. The sequel adds a mule you may earn to carry your wares throughout your journey, but its vulnerability may influence your path as well. Weigh each decision carefully.</li><li><strong>Two-Player Split Screen and Online Cooperative</strong> – Aurai is a grueling place, but you mustn’t go alone. Plan and prepare alongside a friend, covering each other’s weaknesses and marrying your strengths. Teamwork expands the opportunities and options for tackling the many challenges you will face in <em>Outward 2</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/outward-2-launches-in-summer-2026]]></content:encoded>
