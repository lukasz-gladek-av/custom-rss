        <p><strong>A Letter from the Developers</strong></p><p>To everyone who has been waiting for this game, we are truly sorry.</p><p>The release date has been moved to “2026.” We apologize for keeping you waiting yet again. The support we’ve received, from the excitement voiced across various communities to the feedback from players who tried the demo at events, has been a tremendous source of encouragement for our team. We are deeply grateful.</p><p>This project involves implementing an unusual system into the game. We believe this system will make the experience truly one-of-a-kind, but such an ambitious approach also presents significant challenges.</p><p>There were moments when we wondered if perhaps creating a game like this was too early for us—or even for humanity—but after much trial and error, the final vision is gradually taking shape. Because we want to present the game at its best, we kindly ask for a little more time.</p><p>Additionally, because of how the game plays, the user interface, and story all change based on the player’s actions. Which means even sharing small bits of information becomes potential spoilers. This has made it difficult to communicate ongoing progress through social media, even though development is continuing steadily each day under director EIKI.</p><p>We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we can share this game with all of you, and we hope you will look forward to it as well. Your patience would mean the world to us.</p><p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <em>EDEN.schemata();</em>.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/eden-schemata-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified.

She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Second Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!

        <p><em>All Adrift</em> is an aesthetic epic on a cosmic scale—a fusion of literary text, painterly visuals, and the interplay of classical and modern music.</p><p>The player becomes Sian Lightchaser—a survivor of an immortal, cursed race, captured by the Arwin Empire and forced to perform surgery on the history of the universe.</p><p>She is imprisoned in the role of a Sacred Author, tasked with creating a religion to glorify Arwin’s eternal authority and the deification of its ruling class.<br>Sian drifts through a cosmos where the ending war has dragged on for four centuries beyond the armistice, repainting the history of the universe as both victim and collaborator.</p><p>This work is a narrative-driven <a title="Genres > Simulation [885 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> adventure that explores the irony of guilt and <a title="Genres > Survival [486 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> through Sian—dispatched across multiple universes to create “Arwinism” for those who massacred her own people, and compelled to confront the unfathomable vastness and histories of the cosmos as she operates on the past and present of planets.</p><p>It is not merely a “game to be played,” but a “philosophical opera” that asks how humanity survives within the indelible memory of its own sins.</p><p>…</p><p>Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. A beautiful flash of gold spreads like a fracture, cracking through the white clouds, as if to swallow the entire sky, then fades. Arwin Type 38; perhaps the light shed by that terminal technology as it swept across yet another helpless galaxy. She envisions the histories erased by that fleeting light. Are those the scars of human sin, or the creases of a world fading away? Either could be true. In an age where humane reflection itself has turned into an odd taste, she plays, if only briefly, the role of an oddity.</p><p>Sian still sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Among the guides busily selling death, one rushes toward the carriage with the vigor of a market peddler, reminding her that this planet she has just arrived on is experimenting with the entertainment of death.</p><p><strong>The Most Ecstatic Deaths: Best Selection</strong></p><p>That ironic title is brazenly stitched in bright thread across the cover the guide thrusts at her window—beside an illustration of the dead, smiling faintly as they lie in ordered rows. The headless coachman gestured threateningly for him to leave. The guide’s eyes, having found no head to glare at, briefly wandered the coachman’s body—until they caught the emblem of Arwin. The moment they did, his eyes dropped, as if to escape a gaze that does not exist.</p><p>In front of all this fuss, Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Her focus drifts indifferently to the billboard above the road.</p><p><strong>Casualties Today: 91,060,000,080</strong></p><p>Four hundred years of ceasefire, held in the name of peace negotiations—and despite centuries of propaganda declaring that “the war is ending,” countless lives still vanish each day, leaving nothing behind, consumed as numbers wielded by those who are unaccountable. Just a numbers game. An endless numbers game. A goddamn huge numbers game. As Sian stares at the board, trying to count the numbers that must have vanished during the long truce, when a sudden voice bursts from the carriage speaker, the fervent cry of the propaganda hour.</p><p>“History is written in Arwin’s handwriting!”</p><p>Lies.</p><p>“Our noble honor is born from devotion to the Empire…”</p><p>Noble lies.</p><p>“The great Arwinian does not fear death—death fears the Arwinian!”</p><p>Great, filthy lies.</p><p>“Entrust your future to the Empire!”</p><p>That one’s honest.</p><p>In this world that can reach every star, whose freedom stretches long only to narrow into a cage, Sian listens to the propaganda echoing through the carriage and thinks.</p><p>Is even this not enough? After obliterating all those peoples, after wiping out all those planets, after rendering all those lives less than mere numbers, is there still something left that must be carved away, resurrecting even this forbidden technology of cosmic surgery?</p><p>She looks at the cursed surgical instrument in her hand, the tool that can turn every life beyond the window into something less than a number. The weight of karma crushes her, suffocating every thought and feeling. Tomorrow’s throat lies in her hand. And now, it is her turn to wield it.</p><p>Surely, there is no god in such a cruel world. Certainly not. Even if there were, it would not be one from which we could hope for salvation. But that was the story up to now. What of tomorrow? At the heart of Arwin’s capital, a tower white enough to be black coils like a serpent, coveting the seat of a godless world as it creeps darkly toward tomorrow.</p><p>Above all these stories, Sian sits imprisoned in the carriage. For a while yet, she will remain so.</p><p>Ribbit!</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Producer, Director, Writer, Game Design Director, Art Director, Music Producer:</strong> Bae Sang Hyun</li><li><strong>Game Designer, Programmer:</strong> Woo Gi Hun</li><li><strong>Composer:</strong> Park Na Hyun</li><li><strong>Voice Cast:</strong> <a title="Games > Mare [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a> Flos, Bae Sang Hyun, Kim Han Baek</li><li><strong>Trailer Voice:</strong> Kim Sin Woo</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/story-driven-adventure-game-all-adrift-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

The player returns to the past from the calendar of the room where the murder took place and intervenes in Ms. Noroi’s life for three hours until the resident, Ms. Noroi, returns home and goes to bed, to make her presence known.</p><p><strong>What Urami-chan Can Do</strong></p><ul><li>Call</li><li>Telekinesis</li></ul><p>After three hours, the player returns to the original time, and if something changes, the date to return is updated.
