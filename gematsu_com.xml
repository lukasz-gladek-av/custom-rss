      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [5,068 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> has released a new video featuring Mark Cerny, lead architect of <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 5 Pro, and Jack Huynh, the senior vice president and general manager of computing and graphics at AMD, discussing the collaboration between Sony Interactive Entertainment and AMD focused on machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay. <span id="more-999017"></span></p><p>In the video, Cerny and Huynh share three gaming technology breakthroughs that will lead to benefits across the gaming industry in the future, <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842" target="_blank">including</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Neural Arrays</strong> – Instead of a bunch of compute units working separately, we’ve built a way for them to team up… sharing data and processing together like a single, focused AI engine. This changes the game for neural rendering: bigger ML models, less overhead, more efficiency, and far greater scalability as workloads grow.​</li><li><strong>Radiance Cores</strong> –&nbsp; A new dedicated hardware block designed for unified light transport. It handles ray tracing and path tracing in real time, pushing lighting performance to a whole new level. This lets the GPU focus on what it does best: shading the scene. The result? A cleaner, faster, and more efficient pipeline, built for the next generation of ray-traced games.​</li><li><strong>Universal Compression</strong> – A system that evaluates every piece of data headed to memory, not just textures, and compresses it wherever possible. Only the essential bytes are sent, dramatically reducing memory bandwidth usage. This means the GPU can deliver more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.​</li></ul></blockquote><p>While these technologies currently only exist in <a title="Genres > Simulation [847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a>, they are planned for inclusion in “a future console in a few years’ time.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>The story begins when mercenary Cloud Strife joins the anti-Shinra resistance group Avalanche on a mission to destroy one of their mako-siphoning reactors. It’s meant to be a one-time gig, but before long Cloud is sucked into an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that puts him on a collision course with a dark figure from his past: Sephiroth.</p><p>It’s a fast-paced tale that combines action and spectacle with powerful character moments. The iconic party of Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith are portrayed in greater depth than ever before—and by the time the credits roll, you’ll love them like friends.</p><p>The action’s pretty great too though. The combat system fuses intense real-time action with menu-based commands—in other words, the exhilarating action of a modern <a title="Genres > Action [3,119 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> with the deep strategy of a <a title="Genres > Turn-Based RPG [1,320 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/turn-based-rpg">turn-based RPG</a>.</p><p>As well as the main <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> story, the <em>Intergrade</em> edition of the game also includes “EPISODE INTERmission.” This two chapter tale takes place concurrently with the main campaign and stars fan-favorite ninja Yuffie Kisaragi.</p><p>With a new character to control, new parts of Midgar to explore and the endlessly entertaining Fort Condor minigame, it’s an essential play before you head into the next game in this pack…</p><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The second game in the remake series follows Cloud and his comrades as they step out of the city of Midgar and into the wider world in pursuit of their enemy, Sephiroth.</p><p>This globe-trotting tale is full of amazing stories and unforgettable places—the war-torn region of Junon, the glitz and glamor of the Gold Saucer, the verdant forests of Gongaga and much more.</p><p>New playable party members join the team too. You’ll take control of Red XIII, Yuffie and Cait Sith, each offering new playstyles and abilities in battle. In battle, you can use new Synergy abilities that let characters team up to deliver powerful attacks.</p><p>The world of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> also provides plenty of diversions and opportunities for a talented mercenary. You can take on side jobs, scour the world for valuable intel, battle powerful fiends, play a few hands of the card game Queen’s Blood, become a chocobo jockey in fast-paced races, take on the many challenges of the battle simulator and much more.</p><p>In short, it’s an incredible game—there’s a reason it won more than 40 Game of the Year awards in 2024!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-ps5-physical-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>
