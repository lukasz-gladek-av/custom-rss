      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Pokemon Legends: Z-A [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> in late 2025, publisher <a title="Companies > The Pokemon Company [405 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokemon Company</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Game Freak [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/game-freak">Game Freak</a> announced. <span id="more-946962"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a> Legends Z-A</em> is a new title in the <em>Pokemon</em> series.</p><p>The story takes place in Lumiose City, the largest city in the Kalos region. Prism Tower stands tall at the center of this city of beautiful vistas. These days, Lumiose is undergoing a high-tech urban redevelopment plan to turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share.</p><p>After you arrive in Lumiose City to see the sights, you’ll meet three Pokemon, one of which will become your first partner—Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile. You’ll choose one of these Pokemon to accompany you on a new journey as you get to know Lumiose City and its inhabitants.</p><p>When you arrive in Lumiose, you’ll meet a new friend and ally—either Urbane or Tawny. The hotel where you’ll be staying is run by AZ. You’ll also meet his partner, Floette. Lumiose’s redevelopment is being managed by Quizartico Inc. You’ll become acquainted with the company’s CEO Jet and her secretary, Vinny. The different people you meet will make your time in Lumiose all the richer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To help people and Pokemon coexist, the city has set up Wild Zones. These areas, located throughout Lumiose, give wild Pokemon habitats where they can thrive. To catch one of these wild Pokemon, aim carefully, then throw a Poke Ball. If you’re having a hard time catching one, have one of your Pokemon use its moves to weaken the target, making it easier to catch.</p><p>This game offers a style of Pokemon battling not seen in previous titles. Moves can have a longer or shorter reach, or different areas of effect, so choose your timing and positioning carefully to gain the upper hand. Lead your partner Pokemon through battles and dodge incoming attacks. Swap Pokemon if you need to and find the right moment to unleash a move.</p><p>What’s more, certain Pokemon can go beyond evolution by undergoing Mega Evolution. When a trainer’s keystone resonates with the Mega Stone held by their Pokemon, the Pokemon will do more than just change shape. It’ll unlock a new level of power, turning the tide of battle in its favor.</p><p>As Lumiose continues its transformation into a city that belongs to both people and Pokemon, who knows what kinds of encounters and experiences will await you.</p></blockquote><p>More information is available via the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.
