A demo is currently available. <span id="more-1004403"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why We Chose to Release in Early Access</strong></p><p>While many players enjoyed the demo, it also helped us identify a number of areas for improvement, such as overall usability and control feel.</p><p>After carefully evaluating the situation, we concluded that launching the game in Early Access—where we can continue to refine it step by step based on player feedback—would be the best approach.</p><p>The main feedback we received included:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Requests to improve combat responsiveness and pacing.</li><li>Comments on tutorial and user interface clarity.</li><li>Requests for controller support.</li><li>Suggestions for expanding <a title="Genres > RPG [17,758 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing</a> options and rebalancing.</li></ul><p><strong>Development Roadmap</strong></p><p>Development will proceed in two phases: work leading up to the Early Access release, and updates following its launch.</p><ul><li><strong>Work Planned Before Early Access Release</strong><ul><li><strong>Combat Controls and Pacing Improvements</strong> – We’re refining combat feel and enemy AI behavior to make battles smoother and more strategic, reducing sources of frustration.</li><li><strong>User Interface Improvements Centered on Dialogue Flow</strong> – We’ve revisited the tutorial and eliminated elements that interrupted play, creating a smoother and more intuitive experience.</li><li><strong>Game Balance Adjustments</strong> – We’re reworking mechanics that made the early game disproportionately easy and fine-tuning overall balance.</li><li><strong>New Feature Additions</strong> – We’re adding several systems that were not available in the demo, including:<ul><li>Access to Sandbox Mode from the beginning of the game</li><li>A new “Found a Nation” path for independent factions</li><li>Romance interactions with NPCs</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Work Planned After Early Access Release</strong><ul><li><strong>Major User Interface Overhaul</strong> – The current interface is designed primarily for mouse input. We plan a large-scale redesign to support controller play and make the UI more intuitive overall.</li><li><strong>Controller Support Implementation</strong> – Controller functionality will be added alongside the UI update.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Improvements Based on Community Feedback</strong> – Even after launch, we’ll continue refining the game together with the community.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Please note that while controller support is one of the most requested features, it requires careful testing and rework, so implementation will take some additional time.</p><p><strong>Early Access Details</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> December 10, 2025 (planned)</li><li><strong>Early Access Duration:</strong> Approximately six months to one year</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $28 (a launch discount is also planned)</li></ul><p><strong>About Combat</strong></p><p>In <em>The End of History</em>, combat emphasizes tactical formation commands and coordinated maneuvers that allow you to flank enemy armies and gain the upper hand.</p><p>While many players shared feedback on control feel and pacing during the demo period, we’ve been addressing these issues for the Early Access version to make battles smoother and more enjoyable.</p><p>We’ll continue to refine combat based on player feedback to deliver an even more polished tactical experience.</p></blockquote><p>And here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2953520/The_End_of_History/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A strategy RPG where you live freely in a vast medieval feudal-simulated sandbox. Listen to the requests of the citizens, trade, plunder, serve, own a territory as a noble, usurp the throne, endless wars, and betrayal. The intertwining of your and numerous NPCs’ intentions creates unique stories.</p><p><em>The End of History</em> is a sandbox-style strategy RPG set in a medieval-inspired world. As the protagonist, you leave your foster parent’s home one day and embark on a journey as an unknown wanderer. In a world where the motives of numerous NPCs intertwine, and cooperation and betrayal collide, you become a part of this world and can live freely as you choose.</p><p><strong>Stop the Collapse of the World</strong></p><p>Your mission is singular: to stop the collapse of the world. The world is heading towards destruction fueled by rising hatred and division. Every <a title="Genres > Action [3,169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> has consequences, and you must observe their effects carefully.</p><p><strong>Live Freely</strong></p><p>From being a nameless entity to becoming a thief, trader, knight, or even a king, your existence in the world is up to you. Your choices shape your destiny.</p><p><strong>“Obelisk” <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery</strong></p><p>This massive and mysterious structure holds the wisdom of a seemingly infinite world. Its existence is now shrouded in mystery, with fragments scattered across the world to piece together its secrets.</p><p><strong>A Unique Story</strong></p><p>This is not a heroic tale, but a record of historical observation.</p><p>The aftermath of battles, the words exchanged, the small, forgotten choices—all of these stir emotions and change actions. NPCs will continue to live their lives without you.</p><p>However, your decisions create ripples in their stories.</p><p>This game does not depict a predetermined scenario, but a unique and unrepeatable history born from the player’s involvement.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/the-end-of-history-launches-in-early-access-on-december-10]]></content:encoded>
