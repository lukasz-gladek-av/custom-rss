        <p>In an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow <a title="Companies > Ancient [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a>s came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most…</p><p>True to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared… but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.</p><p>Take on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes’ command.

Casual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.</li><li><strong>Music and Voices</strong> – Kenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.
