A limited edition will also be available for 12,980 yen. <span id="more-940936"></span></p><p><em>Scarlet Salvation</em> is described as a challenging game led by Hiroshi Aoki, who previously produced games like <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory 5 [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-5">Rune Factory 5</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory 4 Special [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-4-special">Rune Factory 4 Special</a></em>, and <em>Dariusburst</em>, and designed <em>Psychic Force</em>. Hiroshi joked that one of his previous games, <em>Global Champion</em> (<em>Kaiser Knuckle</em> in Japan), also ended up having a high difficulty. Despite its difficulty, <em>Scarlet Salvation</em> has been adjusted to be easy to play without stumbling over the controls.</p><p>The protagonist, Willow Martin (voiced by Fairouz Ai), has no memory of her past, but when a fight begins, her body moves naturally and she displays exceptional combat abilities. Another character, AI (voiced by Junichi Suwabe), also appears.</p><p>Willow has access to 10 different weapon types, including flashy ones typical of science-fiction. These weapons can also be upgraded. There are teleportation-like movements and parrying mechanics as well.</p><p>Dungeons are randomly generated. When you die, your weapons and levels are lost, but a mysterious number on your face increases.</p><p>While the announcement itself is only available in Famitsu as of now, Compile Heart also <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000742.000080401.html" target="_blank">released</a> a teaser trailer and opened a <a href="https://www.compileheart.com/sls/" target="_blank">teaser website</a>. The teaser trailer features Willow, with the number â00001â on her face, engaged in combat against mechanical weaponry.</p><!-- AD: content -->
