However, what awaits is a constantly changing world. The true story behind <em>Million Depth</em> differs between timelines, and Moma’s fate too changes with the world around her.</p><p>Moma’s past decisions have consequences that ripple into the future and even other timelines in unimaginable ways. She will have to piece together fragmented clues from her journey to solve the many mysteries she comes across.</p><p><strong>Freeze Time to Strategize</strong></p><p>Moma has a “biotope jammer,” an incredible device that stops time around her as long as she also stays motionless. It’s her key to <a title="Genres > Survival [451 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> in <em>Million Depth</em>, where all sorts of dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows. Even if she finds herself surrounded by enemies, she can stop them in their tracks to figure out a way to break through.</p><p>However, Moma’s weapons and shields only have limited durability. During battle, they deteriorate and eventually break. Until they’re repaired, Moma becomes completely defenseless, but this is when the biotope jammer comes in clutch. Freeze time, carefully plan your next move, and ensure Moma’s survival.</p><p><strong>Get Creative with Weapon <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a></strong></p><p>Moma can equip two pieces of equipment, both hand-crafted by combining different types of blocks.</p><p>Some blocks can be upgraded by being placed with others of the same type. Use them wisely to craft any weapon, from long-range guns to sturdy shields.</p><p>Ultimately, your creativity is what will give you the upper hand.</p><p><strong>Barter with Shopkeepers</strong></p><p>Throughout Moma’s journey, she will encounter several shopkeepers offering crafting blocks, items, and relics that can enhance her abilities.</p><p>However, shops in <em>Million Depth</em> don’t take traditional payment. Barter with the shopkeepers while keeping a keen eye on the value of your offer and the shopkeepers’ mood to get the best deal possible. If it goes well, they might offer you valuable items at bargain prices, but if you get too greedy, you risk upsetting the shopkeeper, who might hike the prices in response.</p><p>What’s more, the underground world is also home to a strange resource called stockinum, the value of which fluctuates constantly…</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/million-depth-launches-november-12]]></content:encoded>
