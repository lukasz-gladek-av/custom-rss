It will launch in Early Access in 2025. <span id="more-949336"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Flat2VR Studios:</p><blockquote><p>Mars is calling—will you endure its unforgiving frontier?</p><p>The Red Planet is vast, desolate, and utterly indifferent to your survival. With nothing but your wits, limited resources, and the tools at your disposal, you must carve out an existence in one of the most hostile environments imaginable.</p><p>For the first time, the <em>Surviving Mars</em> universe has been brought to virtual reality, delivering a fully immersive survival experience where every decision matters. Establish an autonomous mining operation, carefully managing oxygen, nutrition, and power to keep yourself alive. Construct and expand your base with hands-on building mechanics, optimizing power grids and resource extraction to stay one step ahead of disaster. Before venturing into the unknown, ensure you’re in optimal condition—every decision must be carefully weighed, as survival depends on preparation as much as action. Take on contracts to mine, refine, and export valuable resources, unlocking advanced blueprints, vehicles, and technology that could mean the difference between thriving and barely scraping by. Shape your survival strategy through smart economic decisions, investing in the tools and infrastructure needed to secure your foothold on the planet.</p><p>Beyond your outpost, an entire planet awaits. Strap on your jetpack and traverse towering cliffs, navigate treacherous dust storms, and uncover the hidden mysteries buried beneath the Martian soil. Every choice shapes your survival—because out here, there are no second chances.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

But will that be enough to save her?</p><p>Sophie is trapped. A blind girl lost in the depths of a decaying mansion, she has only one lifeline—her teddy bear. In <em>Out of Sight VR</em>, you don’t just control Sophie; you see through Teddy’s eyes, guiding her through a world of shifting shadows, unseen threats, and long-buried secrets.</p><p>This groundbreaking second-person virtual reality experience challenges everything you know about immersion, flipping the traditional first-person perspective on its head. As Teddy, you are both within the world and separate from it, an ever-present protector who must navigate danger without directly controlling Sophie’s fate. Position yourself strategically, reveal hidden pathways, and ensure she avoids the sinister captors stalking her every move.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Every step unravels a deeper mystery. Perspective-shifting chase sequences blur the line between fear and urgency as Sophie is carried through the mansion, forced to flee from forces she cannot see. Dual-perspective puzzle-solving demands both careful planning and quick thinking, forcing you to place yourself in key locations to guide her to safety. And as you explore, remnants of the past whisper their warnings—traces of those who came before, their fates unknown.  </p><p>Drenched in atmosphere and rich with emotional depth, <em>Out of Sight VR</em> delivers a uniquely harrowing experience—one that goes beyond fear and into responsibility. Every choice you make as Teddy is an act of care, every successful escape a moment of relief. You are her eyes. You are her guardian. But is that enough to bring her to safety?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Out of Sight VR -  Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDSPkAIvevA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
