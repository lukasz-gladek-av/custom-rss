            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Version 1.15 Update</strong></p><p>Say hello to Patch 1.15, our new update that has just been released on Steam! Before listing all the patch notes, let’s start with what has been our #1 priority for this patch: optimization across all platforms.</p><p>We’ve constantly been going through the game top to bottom, searching for things to optimize. With today’s patch, the biggest improvements should be seen on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>. Our internal testing shows a significant performance boost of around 20+ more frames per second.</p><p>These optimizations should also help older or weaker <a title="Platforms > PC [24,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>s run the game better, although, as always with PC, it heavily depends on your hardware. Modern or high-end PCs probably won’t see much difference, but the game should run better overall. Our internal testing also shows an improvement of around two-to-three frames per second on Steam Deck and <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,986 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, regarding PlayStation 5: we’re working really hard on this platform, but the issues we’re facing mostly come from how Unity handles graphics on PlayStation 5 (which we can’t change) and, unfortunately, memory allocation as well. This makes fixes tricky, but we’re digging through systems and rewriting parts of the game to find any solutions.</p><p>Our internal testing shows that we’re getting closer to significantly reducing crashes, and we hope to push an update that should help with this when Sarras launches. This crash-fixing patch will, of course, be available to everyone, not only to people who decide to buy Sarras.</p><p>All in all, the struggle for better performance on PlayStation 5 continues, and we’re doing everything we can on our end to improve the situation. We hope to have more good news in February, but we can’t promise anything; it’s not entirely in our hands. Still, today’s patch should offer a small boost to performance and stability. We’re really sorry for all the trouble, and thank you for your patience.</p><p>Now, for the rest of the patch notes!</p><ul><li><strong>Gameplay</strong><ul><li>Three items that were meant to land in 1.1 were missing.

That’s right, just one week left! Let that sink in.</p><p><em>*We are calling it expansion instead of downloadable content, as we feel a new, fresh <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,759 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> for $15 USD should not be in the same category as a few cosmetic skins.</em></p><p>Okay, cool, but what is “Sanctuary of Sarras” about?</p><p>The journey will take you into the titular sanctuary, a realm shaped by the deep sea. <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> structures rise from the ever-shifting currents, and forgotten paths pulse with the life of a submerged world. But try not to get charmed, as when you begin to explore the unknown, the true nature of Sarras starts to surface.</p><p>For six centuries, the fate of Sarras and its rebel crew has been shrouded in myth. Now, a hidden passage reveals a path into the past. In a completely new storyline, follow the trail of Nimue and the deserters who challenged King Arthur. Piece together the truth behind their disappearance and Merlin’s horrible retribution.</p><p>So yeah! This will be practically like a whole new act for the game, with 10-15 hours of gameplay, a new storyline, interesting characters, and multiple side quests! As mentioned before, there are TONS of new content coming. Not to spoil everything, but some of them are:</p><ul><li>Four new epic bosses.</li><li>12 unique regular enemies.</li><li>more than 20 hand-crafted dungeons and interiors.</li><li>Over 100 equipment pieces, including armor (#FashionGrail), melee weapons, bows, rings, amulets, spells, relics…</li></ul><p>The expansion will also feature an alternate progression system! Activate sacred shrines to gain special skill points to spend within three new, distinct skill trees. You can level them all up at the same time, and choose which one is active at any moment. This will allow you to change your build on the fly and adapt quickly!</p><p>For those interested, you don’t need to finish the game to enter the expansion zone! To access the Sanctuary of Sarras, you’ll only need to have Cuanacht (act 2) unlocked.</p><p>How much will the expansion cost?</p><p>“Sanctuary of Sarras” will be available for $14.99 USD on Steam (or your regional equivalent).</p><p>More info about the expansion coming soon, so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>■ Bonus Content Downloadable Content #1</strong></p><p>We have also decided to add some extra content for free to the core game! We hope that you will enjoy this free addition.</p><p>You will get five completely new armor sets, serving as rewards for your in-game achievements.</p><ul><li>Fore-Dweller – Finish the “I See A Darkness” quest.</li><li>Champion – Kill the Wyrdstalker.</li><li>Harbinger – Finish the “Thing On The Doorstep” quest.</li><li>Weaver – Resolve the mysterious encounters with the Weaver.</li><li>Unhallowed Divinity – Finish the “Menhir Rites” quest.</li></ul><p>Along with that, the downloadable content includes alternative looks for Qrko (your cute little pet), King Arthur, and Caradoc.</p></div><p><em>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,398 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-expansion-sanctuary-of-sarras-announced]]></content:encoded>
