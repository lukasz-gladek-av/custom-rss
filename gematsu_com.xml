After clearing each room, players are treated to randomized event scenes, where anything can happen—from unexpected <a title="Genres > RPG [17,942 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> fights to bizarre outcomes!

        <p>Sir Solomon and the Saviors of Light depart Castle Cornelius to free Princess Tsuna from the grasp of the evil Devil Lord!

After clearing each room, enjoy a short cutscene, in which anything could happen! Will you find an item? A random encounter RPG fight? Will the world get destroyed? Find out by conquering each room of the Devil Lord’s castle, one challenge at a time!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Over 50 fun levels to play through, each with multiple objectives!</li><li>Fun randomized event scenes between levels with hundreds of outcomes!
