A release date was not announced. It will also be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-1003103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hooded Horse:</p><blockquote><p>Set merely a few years after the events of the critically acclaimed survival horror game <em>Darkwood</em>, the sequel brings with it new lands and waters to explore, new creatures to fear, and new reasons to pray for the morning light. Featuring an entirely new story and new characters, the unfolding events of <em>Darkwood II</em> stand on their own, and can be equally enjoyed regardless of whether you’ve played the first game in the series.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly—an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why—retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature.</p><p>All around lie the ruins of a vanished world—deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night—even walls can’t guarantee safety. </p><p>As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder—is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Only the heart of the forest holds the answer.</p><p><em>Darkwood II</em> sends you on dangerous meandering paths across barren deserts, through thick marsh, and on deep waters alike. As the locals fight to keep the slowly spreading woods at bay, you must rely on your wits to overcome your fears and find your way—there are no quest markers or waypoints to guide you.</p><p>Scavenge for resources, craft weapons to protect yourself, and seek out shelter by night, building barricades and traps to hide behind, securing yourself against an enemy that can strike from any direction. Will you cower in a cellar as the doors creak open and close a few floors above you, or will you stand against the horrors that stalk the night? Or perhaps you’ll choose to rely on strange concoctions to gain new skills and capabilities that may just keep you alive—in a manner of speaking.</p><p>Meet twisted characters, each with their own motivations—learn their dark backstories and make decisions that will determine their fates and impact the world itself, changing your story as you move through it.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/darkwood-ii-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
