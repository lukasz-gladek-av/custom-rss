This charming café, located on the first floor to give the girls real-world experience, becomes a place where he shares the sweet and sour moments of work life alongside them in their cute uniforms.</p><p>His tireless efforts do not go unnoticed, and the heroines come to hold his kindness deep in their hearts. And when so many bright personalities live together under one roof, isn’t it inevitable that a single spark will ignite a flame?</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>On one fateful day, my apartment burns down.</p><p>My younger sister, Yaotome Suzuka, secures a room in Hoshikuzu Academy’s dormitory. As for me, I’m left unemployed and homeless. </p><p>Just when things look bleak, an unexpected opportunity appears: a job as the live-in dorm mother of the very same all-girls dormitory where my sister is staying! Room, board, and pay—there’s no reason to refuse! </p><p>But there’s a catch: I have to work at the crepe café next door as well. It’ll be a lot of work, sure, but I’m not about to turn it down! Plus, I’ll be watching over a group of distinct girls as their dorm mother… </p><p>The gorgeous, full-bodied girl who seems to know my past. My socially awkward younger sister who struggles with group life. The narcissist who craves the approval of others. The petite dorm president who hides a deep desire to be dependent. The pure-hearted, carefree gyaru who wears her heart on her sleeve. The mature older woman who has seen it all.</p><p>No problem! I’ll make sure to take good care of every single one of them!</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Omi Nozomi</strong> (voiced by Nekota Mike) – “Good morning, sunshiiine!” Nozomi is the perfect senpai, admired by everyone at Hoshikuzu Dormitory. <a title="Games > Beneath [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> that polished exterior, though, lies a girl with an unshakable will and a secret she’s kept close to her heart: the dorm mother (ơ) changed her life when they were kids. Reunited under the same roof, her long-held gratitude transforms into something far more complicated… and she’s determined to use her courage-and her curves-to finally make him notice her.</li><li><strong>Yaotome Suzuka</strong> (voiced by Moriya Kokoro) – “You don’t need to baby me, Oniichan.” After losing her home in a fire, Suzuka is set to be separated from her beloved Oniichan as she moves into Hoshikuzu Dormitory. Luckily for her, however, the dorm gets a new mother (8) and it happens to be… her brother?! A sweet girl who’s also a bit of a brocon, Suzuka must learn to become independent and cope with her new environment. Will she learn to rely on her brother less, or will their bond grow ever stronger?</li><li><strong>Kinugawa Miu</strong> (voiced by Hazuki Hikari) – “Hey, do you really not know who I am?” Miucha is the hottest up-and-coming influencer on Inshta, hoping to inspire young girls everywhere. Behind the filters and followers, however, she’s secretly a needy, attention-starved brat with a fragile ego… and a burning desire to prove herself. The dorm mother (o) is entirely unimpressed with her antics. Can he knock some sense into her, or will they just drive each other insane?</li><li><strong>Kotobuki Tamaki</strong> (voiced by Hara Popoko) – “Perserverance is admirable and all, but try to take it easy.” Tamaki’s the perfect president for Hoshikuzu Dormitory. She’s diligent, well-mannered, and takes her responsibilities very seriously. However, due to her short stature and her babyface, many people treat her like a kid. She’d never admit it, but deep down, she doesn’t mind being spoiled… and the dorm mother (ơ) is ready to dole out some pampering.</li><li><strong>Okai Tanpopo</strong> (voiced by Tsukishiro Mahiru) – “Just sit back and chillax! Mamarin’s the pride of our cafe!” Tanpopo is a carefree gyaru at Hoshikuzu Dormitory with a personality as easygoing as her smile. She’s friendly with everyone, and a little bit silly, and doesn’t bother with formalities-especially not with the dorm mother (o), whom she’s dubbed “Mamarin.” Her innocent, spacey nature makes her impossible to hate, but when Mamarin starts indulging her whims, things start spiraling out of control. After all, once Tanpopo decides something’s “fun,” there’s no telling where she’ll take it next…</li><li><strong>Urushihara Ayako</strong> (voiced by Aono Musubi) – “We goody two-shoes are only good for being gears in the grander machine of society.” Ayako is the manager of Honey &amp; Beary, the cute café attached to Hoshikuzu Dormitory. She keeps everything running smoothly, including managing a gaggle of girls from the dorm. She’s sharp, capable, and endlessly dependable… until someone pushes the wrong button. Beneath all this, though, she’s vulnerable, and lately, a certain dorm mother (ơ) has caught her eye.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>Become the dorm mother (male) of an all-girls dormitory.</li><li>Live together with a diverse cast of heroines and work with them at a crepe cafe.</li><li>Get to know each girl through heartwarming and hilarious daily interactions.</li><li>Unlock sweet romantic events and guide the story toward a happy ending with the one who captures your heart.</li><li>Get a unique perspective by viewing the girls’ thoughts.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the opening movie below.
