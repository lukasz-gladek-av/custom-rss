        <p><strong><em>Aaahh!!! Real Monsters</em></strong></p><p>Greeting terror-trainees!</p><p>Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina will have to prove themselves on the Monster midterm exams if they want to call themselves real monsters! They must work together as a team to receive a single gruesome grade on their frightful performance. So..go out and petrify someone!</p><p>Ickis’ Frightening Fling propels all three monsters over the Museum’s colossal creature.</p><p>At the Mall, Oblina shops around for enemies to terrorize – then she charges.</p><p>Run. Jump. Slam dunk the nonsters through the hoop</p><p>After a special delivery scare at the post office, Ickis slides down the mail chute</p><ul><li>Explore over 25 different monster levels, including five bonus levels.</li><li>Team up the threesome to perform triple monster moves.</li><li>Switch the lead monster with three-way character control.</li><li>Chase away enemies with unique monster scare moves.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Nickelodeon G.U.T.S.</em></strong></p><p>It takes more than skill to slam dunk on a 12-foot hoop..to tear through Tornado Run.. or to conquer the awesome Aggro Crag.</p><p>It takes GUTS.</p><p>Climb into the Extreme Arena and aim for your personal best in Nickelodeon GUTS training.

He’s on the loose in O’Town, and he’s got a knack for getting into trouble. O’Town can be a dangerous place, filled with tons of puzzling pitfalls.</p><p>Down at Rocl-O-Whey Beach, we’ll protect Spunky from one-eyed pelicans, crusty crabs, and other dangerous sea creatures. True fun in the sun!</p><p>Steel-jawed, steam-belching contraptions threaten Spunky over at Hill-O-Stench garbage dump. I hope you’re quick-minded! Throughout the neighborhood, we’ll follow Spunky from treacherous treehouses to dingy basements, keeping him out of danger. Are you ready to face the Bigheads?</p><p>Finally, we’ll outsmart wild washing machines, tricky lint traos and grungy gripes to rescue Spunky from the depths of Laundryland. Please help Spunky survive the spin cycle!</p><p>The only rest we’ll get is when Spunky lies down here for a nice, quiet…Spunky?</p><p>Hey Spunky? What in the blazes?!?! SPUNKY!!!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/nickelodeon-splat-pack-launches-january-30-xbox-series-version-canceled]]></content:encoded>
