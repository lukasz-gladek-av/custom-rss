Providing detailed pixel art and expressive animation. <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a fun world with lots of colorful characters. Come and disrupt their peace.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Late at night you enter their world. You will inhabit a girl named Abby and influence the world around her. Accompanied by her brother Michael you will traverse unfamiliar places, character conflicts, and story affecting decision making. You have the power to help the world or let it rot. Careful your presence has caught the attention of something sinister…</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Many indie <a title="Genres > RPG [17,266 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> claim to be a new quirky game, but <em>Away From Home</em> is a mix of many great RPGs. The characters are full of emotion and let you empathize with them. Don’t forget that this world needs you.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Imagine if a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> and a Rhythm game had a love child. This game plays like Earthbound when it comes to walking and talking in it’s overworld, but when it comes to missions and battles it throws in <a title="Genres > Rhythm [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> related to the event. Characters also have real voices to help create mood and feeling to them. The big highlight of the gameplay is the huge amount of animations. The characters in this world are alive and through your gameplay you will begin to understand.</p><p>The amount of things to do in locations are never ending. Chocked full of lengthy side missions that unlock you new moves and items as well as random chance based events. The progression of side quests and random town events are based from entertaining games such as <em><a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> 0</em>!</p><p>The world is large and will take you hours to complete everything, not to mention alternate routes that bring replayability. Some routes include game changing decisions as well as items and battles you wouldn’t be able to do had you made different choices.</p><p><strong>Battles</strong></p><p>The battles are in a third-person view with rhythm-based function. The UI has a fight button, special button, items button, and block button. Using arrow keys your <a title="Genres > Action [2,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will be in sync with the music. If you press a key on the beat, you gain action points for special attacks.</p><p>For the first time, skill and strategy are balanced out by the battle system. You will need to use skill to time your choices and hits in time. Mean while you will need to use strategy to counteract opponents special attacks. Such as if you have an opponent with poison, you will want to apply anti poison items in your arsenal. Both you planning and action will be put to the test.</p><p>Items are unlocked by completion of side quests and can be purchased at the stores, some items are very powerful and can only be received once. You must plan three items to bring into battle and have immediately available. As well as unlock special moves that pair well with your arsenal.</p><p>The battles are stocked full of special effects to keep the fight lively! Rather than being told what’s happening around you like in a traditional RPG, you will get to witness everything from falling confetti to flashes of lightning!</p><p>Enemies have special attacks as well. Enemy specials send you into a full on quick time event with high detailed pixel art. Where you must hit provided keys. Failure to hit them in time results in major damage taken.</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>This game has may talented artists including yours truly. We bring life to the game in visually stunning ways. We focus on facial expression as well as detailed animation. Many people have poured their souls into this project. Some animations in the game took over 100 hours and I’m exited for you to see them.</p><p>We hope to convey emotion and expression in ways similar to games like Mother 3. With the high rendered detail in this game, every pixel counts. One pixel could change frown to a smile. So attention to detail goes a long way.</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>This game has an outstanding soundtrack so far. Music determines so much in a game such as mood, atmosphere, and tension. The original soundtrack has many amazing artists including NickNuwe, Chaotrope, Zakku, and Nelward.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
