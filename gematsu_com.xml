    <p><span>PC version published independently by Spry Fox.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Following news that <a title="Companies > Spry Fox [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/spry-fox">Spry Fox</a> will be spinning out of <a title="Companies > Netflix [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and become an independent studio again, the developer has announced a <a title="Platforms > PC [25,000 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of cozy <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">massively multiplayer online game</a> <em><a title="Games > Spirit Crossing [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/spirit-crossing">Spirit Crossing</a></em> will launch via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321960/Spirit_Crossing/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in early 2026. <span id="more-1012413"></span></p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is currently in open alpha testing for iOS via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/ZPvQcYsy" target="_blank">App Store</a> (TestFlight) and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.SpiritCrossing" target="_blank">Google Play</a>. The mobile versions will remain published by Netflix, but the PC version will be published by Spry Fox.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Spry Fox:</p><blockquote><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is a cozy massively multiplayer online game focused on the joy of shared experiences, creative expression, and connection with friends within a vast, beautiful world with ever-changing environments. The game invites players to relax and explore a fantastical landscape as they harvest, participate in fishing tournaments or simply enjoy a quiet sunrise with friends or by themselves.</p><p>As players join the game, they will be assigned to a Waystation—a unique, thriving community that players collectively build, decorate, and fortify through offerings and acts of kindness. Players can travel to other Waystations, and participate in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [358 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> activities such as harvesting, dancing and mural painting, or simply enjoy the world at their own pace.</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> emphasizes social interaction through a unique friendship progression system which unlocks features over time, such as proximity chat, two-player emotes, instant teleportation, and gift-giving. Beyond construction and socializing, self-expression is encouraged and facilitated with a housing system letting players decorate their own spaces with their own creative vision, and extensive avatar customization options.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During exploration, they will encounter delightfully small square bears, mysterious and charming villagers and wandering spirits in need of help and safety. With patience and kindness they will start to slowly open up to the player, revealing their stories and even gifting items back. </p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PC Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Spirit Crossing - Steam Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKdp5mY8l18?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/spirit-crossing-adds-pc-version]]></content:encoded>
