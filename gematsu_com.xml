Whether by chance or fate, its prototype space station, the Tiqqun, finds itself cast adrift, a disintegrating ark upon which the remnants of humanity must find sanctuary – and you, Administrator, are at its helm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>IXION</em> is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.</p><p>There are no simple solutions; your <a title="Genres > Action [2,554 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will have repercussions, now or further down the line. How you deal with those repercussions will be the difference between <a title="Genres > Survival [385 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and extinction.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>In DOLOS We Trust</strong> – A population to manage, survivors to find, cryopods to recover… Maintain your crew’s trust in the corporation that started this venture, or face failure and mutiny. Six sectors can be unlocked within the station, each able to house more population, support new jobs, and provide opportunity to monitor the crew with the Data Listening System. Will you bring hope to the people?</li><li><strong>Choices in the Dark</strong> – Who said DOLOS was the only faction to escape the fate of the Earth? Brush up against other pockets of survivors, navigate on from the failures and wrecks of others… <em>IXION</em> will lead the player through gripping chapters of story, where new threats and opportunities are presented, all in aid of reaching the final destination, a new home.</li><li><strong>Frontier Academia</strong> – DOLOS are famed for their innovative technology, their scientists, but the Tiqqun now finds itself cut off. Find what resources you can, research what you do not have. Find new ways to provide for your settlement, construct new buildings to create what’s needed. Modify the Tiqqun station, improve it, forge ahead in this odyssey.</li><li><strong>Occupational Hazards</strong> – Space is a dangerous place. Hull breaches, overloaded power supplies, electrical fires… It is up to you to manage these risks, deal with emergencies, create backup power solutions, and enable Extra Vehicular Activity…</li><li><strong>Stellar Exploration</strong> – There are whole new stellar maps to explore. Send out probes to reveal what’s hidden, create mining and cargo ships to find resources, commission science expeditions to discover the secrets and threats you’ll find out there in space. Encounter other survivors and bring them into the fold of your mission, objective – survive.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
