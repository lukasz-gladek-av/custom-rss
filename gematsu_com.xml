An English version of the “Combat Support System: Particle Armaments Trailer” trailer, which was previously released in Japanese, was also released. <span id="more-972462"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>The new story trailer, which debuted on IGN Live, offers a look at some of the mysterious enemies, supporting characters, and stylish <a title="Genres > Action [2,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-combat against monsters and Arsenals that players will experience through the game’s thrilling narrative.</p><p>Additionally, <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina">Daemon X Machina</a></em> series producer Kenichiro Tsukuda joined IGN to discuss insights behind the move from large mechs to compact armored suits and their customizable nature, the unique asynchronous multiplayer elements in the game, and reveal more about the conflict between humans, Outers, and Immortals that drives the story.</p><p>The publisher has also opened digital pre-orders on all platforms in the Americas, available as a standard edition for $69.99; a Digital Deluxe edition, which includes the game and access to substantial post-launch downloadable content, featuring new story content and customization options for your Arsenal and Outer, for $89.99; and a Super Digital Deluxe edition, which includes the game, the aforementioned downloadable content sets, a digital soundtrack, and a digital art book, for $99.99.</p><p>All digital pre-orders will get the “Special Equipment Set” downloadable content as a bonus, which includes the “Bahamut” Arsenal Skin, the Beguiling Suit (Outer Suit), and the Special Equipment – Victorious Gleam (Laser Blade), as well as the “Purchase Bonus Item Set” downloadable content, which includes the Special Equipment – Variable Breadth (Longbow), Bonus Attachment Set 1, and Bonus Item Set.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The latest Gameplay Systems video delves into the functionality of the particle weapon Combat Support System, a preinstalled modification for Arsenal body armor providing Outers with powerful particle armaments. The three basic systems include Assault Shift (AS), which automatically targets and shoots enemies, Guard Shift (GS), offering a directional shield that nullifies attacks, and Wing Shift (WS), giving players the ability to fly at high speeds. Using these particle armaments consumes a limited resource, Femto, giving Outers a powerful temporary boost to be used strategically.</p></blockquote><p><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,700 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,384 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,457 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 5 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the trailers below.</p><h2><span>Story Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion - Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2hu2_eMgwY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『DAEMON X MACHINA TITANIC SCION』2ndトレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ug4isPkg70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Combat Support System: Particle Armaments Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion - Combat Support System: Particle Weapons Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/krKsiwkP9co?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only have I been able to bring my unique ideas to life, but I’ve also had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people along the way.”</p><p>poncle founder Luca Galante added, “NaoGames shares the poncle spirit of making games that are immediately accessible, affordable, and a bit out of the ordinary; for fun. When I first met Shibata-san and played <em>Berserk or Die</em>, I knew this was a game that deserved to be seen and played by more people. I’m really happy we got to support Shibata-san and hopefully make that happen.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via poncle:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Berserk or Die</em>, players take on the role of a lone soldier left standing on a ravaged battlefield, fending off the hordes of enemies swarming from left and right. To survive, players must buy from peddlers, hit the training grounds, and mash as many keys on their keyboard as possible without voiding their warranty. Movement in each stage is controlled entirely by attacks, so players don’t need to reach a specific destination, just survive the onslaught. The more keys you press, the more devastating your attacks will become – and if keyboards aren’t for you, controllers work just as well, plus further accessibility options.</p><!-- AD: content -->
