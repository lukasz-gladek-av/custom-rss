However, the team determined that it needed more time to finish the game on its own terms, citing the ongoing war in Ukraine and the significant genre shift of the sequel compared to their previous titles as reasons for the delay.</p><p>“Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to,” Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. “At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone’s guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time.”</p><p>Frogwares lead game designer Alexander Gresko added, “Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,633 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.”</p><p>Oganesyan continued, “We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know. We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years.”</p><p>Frogwares also shared 13 new screenshots showcasing the game’s setting, enemies, and atmosphere, as well as promised that it will be “showing a lot more gameplay over the next few months.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><strong>Abolished Systems for Fair Competition / Mouse Controls</strong></p><p>“Next, I’d like to explain some of the systems we decided to remove in order to ensure fair competition across all platforms,” LEVEL-5 CEO Akihiro Hino explained. “First were the features we had originally designed specifically for Switch—switching between portrait and landscape modes, and stylus controls. These would be difficult to implement on other platforms, so we decided to remove them in consideration of the game’s cross-play specifications.</p><p>“Instead, the game will support mouse controls. At launch, mouse controls will be supported across Switch 2 and PC. Mouse controls will be added to the PlayStation 5 version via an update. Mouse controls will not be available on Switch and PlayStation 4. On Switch 2, the mouse controls are supported via the packed-in Joy-Cons.”</p><p><em>(Editor’s Note: It is likely the Xbox Series version will also receive the mouse support update. Hino never specifically mentions the Xbox version in the broadcast, even when talking about the system specifications above when the information was listed on-screen.)</em></p><p><strong>Player Bank / Potential Sequel</strong></p><p>“The game will feature over 5,400 characters, but collecting them all won’t be easy,” Hino said. “We don’t know how long it’ll take to collect them all—it could take an absurdly long time. So we’ve added the ability to carry over your save data to the next game.”</p><p>Hino continued, “To explain in greater detail, the characters you collect can be stored in a save area called the Player Bank. You’ll manage your players by transferring them between the Player Bank and your main save data. That being said, it’s not complicated, and isn’t much different from leaving your characters at a tavern in other <a title="Genres > RPG [17,718 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>.</p><p>“However, there are alternate versions of the same characters with different abilities, so there’s a chance that even storage for 5,400 characters might not be enough. In that case, you may have to delete some characters as you progress—but I don’t think you’ll be able to collect that many right away anyway.</p><p>“The important thing is, the Player Bank can be carried over to a potential sequel, so even if you only manage to collect around 700 characters in this game, you’ll be able to continue collecting them in the next one.”</p><p><strong>Inagle: Official Player Search System</strong></p><p>LEVEL-5 will launch an official player search system called “Inagle” on October 22, which will be accessible via PC or smartphone browsers. Inagle can be used to search and view player stats, although some information will remain hidden until the game’s official launch. Plans are also in the works to allow users to create and share their own teams.</p><p><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven</em> New Era Kickoff Eve Festival: Four-Hour Special Broadcast</strong></p><p>LEVEL-5 will host a four-hour special broadcast called “<em>Inazuma Eleven</em> New Era Kickoff Eve Festival: Four-Hour Special Broadcast” on November 10. The contents of the broadcast are currently under wraps, but Hino suggested that various people involved with the series will appear.</p></blockquote><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on November 13 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the videos below.</p><h2><span>Final Trailer 1: Story</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9UO6I9qSQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Final Trailer 2: Chronicle</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LcMY6e8Voo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Final Trailer 3: Endless Fun</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n8XcE8HZL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Music Video: “Guidepost (Ending Theme)” by Hinano Iwasaki</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="【MV】岩﨑ひなの「道標」/『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』EDテーマ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7X7RQ-F7JHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>INA-DAI: October 21, 2025</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="発売直前！イナズマイレブン特別公式配信番組「イナダイ」" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCbzPJUh02o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details]]></content:encoded>
