As Japan finds itself at the height of its bubble economy, young upstarts Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima take on two massive entertainment districts within Tokyo and Osaka, facing their greatest threat in the series thus far.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In this brand-new director’s cut, enjoy additional scenes starring major characters and the series’ first-ever online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, Red Light Raid!</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The battle deciding the next ruler of Kamurocho begins.</p><p>It is December of 1988. Within the vibrant district of Kamurocho, Tokyo, numerous organizations are mobilizing to seize control of a large-scale redevelopment project. However, a tiny lot with an unidentified owner is all it takes to throw these plans into disarray.</p><p>The “Empty Lot.” The struggle over this meager plot of land soon escalates into a major conflict involving powerful yakuza organizations from both the east and west.</p><p>As one era draws to a close, the stage is set for two legends to carve out their legacies.</p><p><strong>Cast</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong> (voiecd by Takaya Kuroda) – A member of the Dojima Family, a direct subsidiary of the Tojo Clan—the largest yakuza organization in Eastern Japan. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised in the Sunflower Orphanage established by Shintaro Kazama, a captain of the Dojima Family. Following in Kazama’s footsteps, he plunges into the depths of the yakuza underworld—but finds himself in a bind after a murder puts him at odds with the Tojo Clan. When the pressure shifts to Kazama, Kiryu steels himself to depart the Dojima Family in order to protect his father figure—though the three Dojima Family lieutenants have no intention of letting him leave quietly.</li><li><strong>Goro Majima</strong> (voied by Hidenari Ugaki) – The manager of the thriving Cabaret Grand in Sotenbori, Osaka. Many know him as the “Lord of the Night” for having skyrocketed the club to popularity. However, this is all a facade to mask his true identity as a former yakuza turned expendable “pet.” Once a member of the Tojo Clan, he was punished for defying a direct order from his superior. For his disobedience, he is condemned with eternal servitude, now no more than a dog under the watchful eye of his master. Majima is finally given an opportunity to rejoin the Tojo Clan under one condition: to murder someone with his own two hands.</li><li><strong>Daisaku Kuze</strong> (voiced by Hitoshi Ozawa) – A former professional boxer, and a true yakuza to the core. His propensity for violence sets him apart from even the rest of the notoriously brutal Dojima Family. As the eldest of the three lieutenants, he leads the Dojima Family in Kazama’s absence—and is currently one step away from becoming the next captain.</li><li><strong>Hiroki Awano</strong> (voiced by Riki Takeuchi) – A hedonist who goes with the flow. However, beneath his laid-back exterior lies a cunning man skilled at intel gathering, often tasked with following through on the Dojima Family’s threats. While Awano outwardly obeys his sworn brother Kuze, he harbors a hidden desire to become the next Dojima Family captain, patiently awaiting his chance to strike.</li><li><strong>Keiji Shibusawa</strong> (voiced by Hideo Nakano) – A shrewd yakuza lieutenant who boasts a reliable skill set and an impressive list of accomplishments. Well-versed in finances, Shibusawa handles the clerical work of the Dojima Family. While he falls behind Kuze and Awano in the pecking order for the next captain, he has yet to reveal his true capabilities.</li><li><strong>Tetsu Tachibana</strong> (voiced by Arata Iura) – A real estate mogul who operates in the shadows of Kamurocho. In a city overflowing with restaurants and pleasure houses, Tetsu Tachibana is notorious for buying up land the moment it hits the market—not hesitating to adopt even the most underhanded tactics. Despite his soft-spoken and sophisticated demeanor, Tachibana holds great ambitions to usurp the Tojo Clan and take control of Kamurocho.</li><li><strong>Jun Oda</strong> (voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi) – A Tachibana Real Estate employee who specializes in on-site land acquisition. Despite his seemingly flippant attitude, Oda is a man with no fear, even in the face of the yakuza. As Tachibana’s right-hand man, he leverages his ample funds and information network to coerce property owners into selling with frightening efficiency.</li><li><strong>Sohei Dojima</strong> (voiced by Hisao Egawa) – A man whose ambitions are matched only by the cruel and ruthless violence he uses to achieve them, laws be damned. Though he reigns as the most powerful patriarch in the Tojo Clan, he owes much of his success to his right-hand Kazama. He is currently attempting to secure the land necessary for the full rights to the entirety of the Kamurocho <a title="Games > Revita [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/revita">Revita</a>lization Project, which will allow him to usurp the title of chairman from the Tojo Clan’s acting second chairman. His three lieutenants hang on his every word, maneuvering to seize control of the Empty Lot—the lynchpin to his ambitions.</li><li><strong>Akira Nishikiyama</strong> (voiced by Kazuhiro Nakaya) – Raised in the Sunflower Orphanage alongside Kiryu, Nishikiyama also followed in the footsteps of Kazama and swore an oath to the Dojima Family. Having been best friends since childhood, Kiryu considers him a brother. While Kiryu has no interest in climbing up the ranks of the yakuza, Nishikiyama has the wits and drive to soar through the ranks.</li><li><strong>Osamu Kashiawgi</strong> (void by Shunsuke Sakuya) – Kazama’s right-hand man and a skilled yakuza whose name is infamous throughout Kamurocho. Sakuya earned the trust of his peers and has been entrusted with running the family. He holds the ideals of duty, empathy, and respect dear, and he will not tolerate anyone who dares stray from their code of honor. As a member of the Kazama Family, a lower-ranking Tojo Clan subsidiary, he technically ranks lower than Kiryu in the Dojima Family. Despite this, Kiryu and Nishikiyama regard him as an older brother figure they fear more than anything.</li><li><strong>Shintaro Kazama</strong> (voiced by Tetsuya Watari) – A key figure in bringing the Dojima Family to power, many regard Kazama as one of the most exceptional men in the Tojo Clan, both in physical strength and character. He personally established the Sunflower Orphanage to support children without families, becoming the father figure and role model to Kiryu and Nishikiyama, who were both raised there. Police took him into custody after one of the Kazama Family’s gambling sites was raided six months ago, and he is currently locked away in prison. The Dojima Family’s three lieutenants have been gunning for his position as captain.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>aru Sera</strong> (voiced by Toru Okawa) – Despite his gentlemanly demeanor, Sera leads an organization that handles the Tojo Clan’s dirtiest work behind the scenes. He eventually joins the dispute over the Empty Lot, but his true motives remain unknown.</li><li><strong>Takashi Nihara</strong> (voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata) – The man at the helm of Eastern Japan’s most powerful underground <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal group in 1988. As such, Nihara stands as a god among men, especially to the rank-and-file members of the clan’s great families. The conflict over the Empty Lot leads him to an unlikely encounter with Kiryu that gives way to a challenging dilemma.</li><li><strong>Tsukasa Sagawa</strong> (voiced by Shingo Tsurumi) – Owner of the Cabaret Grand who keeps Majima on a tight leash in Sotenbori, wielding the power to kill him at a moment’s notice. Majima winds up in his care after Futoshi Shimano, Majima’s former boss and Sagawa’s sworn brother, hands him the reins. Despite his low-key profile amid Sotenbori’s nightlife, he is a dangerous man who is not above violence when things don’t go the way he planned.</li><li><strong>The Blind Woman</strong> (voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro) – An employee of the massage parlor, Hogushi Kaikan. Although her vision is impaired, she uses her skills as a massage therapist to overcome her handicap and make a living. She lives quietly on the edge of Sotenbori, unaffected by the city’s hustle and bustle. However, she soon finds herself caught in the crosshairs of a bloody yakuza conflict after a certain incident.</li><li><strong>The God Hand</strong> (voiced by Kazunari Tanaka) – The owner of a massage parlor on the outskirts of Sotenbori. Despite his terrifying appearance, he is a very friendly and caring man. His skills as an acupuncturist have earned him his distinct nickname. However, the keenness of his eyes suggests he’s more than your average everyday civilian.</li><li><strong>Homare Nishitani</strong> (voiced by Keiji Fujiwara) – An unpredictable man whose three tenets of life are money, sex, and violence. He is loyal only to his desires and acts upon them without fear of consequence. Not even an organization as large as the Omi Alliance can entirely control him. Majima may find that his fate is more tied to this man than he ever hoped.</li><li><strong>Futoshi Shimano</strong> (voiced by Naomi Kusumi) – Audacious and brutal, he has a hulking figure and an intimidating presence that demands respect. As the head of Majima’s former family, he is responsible for Majima’s expulsion from the yakuza and exile to Sotenbori. Shimano has given Sagawa control over Majima, but his reasons for not using or killing him outright are his own.</li><li><strong>Billiken</strong> (voiced by Ryohei Nakao) – A balding, aged detective on the force. Now on the verge of retirement, he’s often seen staring out at the Sotenbori River, smoking a cigarette. However, this man is well-known in the underground world of Sotenbori—yakuza of the Omi Alliance know him as Billiken.</li><li><strong>Yamagata</strong> (voiced by Kazuya Nakai) – Under his <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, the Odyssey’s popularity is only rivaled by that of Majima’s club, The Grand. Skilled and always keeping an eye on the trends, he runs his club as smoothly as possible. Currently, he has his eye on the cabaret club business model that’s recently sprouted up in Japan.</li></ul><p><strong>Director’s Cut</strong></p><p>Spend more time with the characters in newly recorded cutscenes!</p><p><strong>Battle</strong></p><p>Go on a rampage with Kiryu and Majima’s unique battle styles!</p><ul><li><strong>Kiryu’s Battle Styles</strong> – Outmuscle your enemies using Kiryu’s overwhelming strength!
