This culminates on the third day, where if players were successful in surviving the night must take on one of the Nightlords—new bosses for this version. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the <em><a title="Games > Elden Ring [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a></em> universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rise Together</strong> – Join forces with other players to take on the creeping night and the dangers within featuring three-player cooperative play.</li><li><strong>Become a Hero</strong> – Take command of uniquely skilled heroes, each possessing their own abilities and distinct flair. While individually powerful, their skills grow even more formidable when united as a team.</li><li><strong>Take on the Night</strong> – Overcome a relentless environmental threat that sweeps through a land that changes between each game session and defeat the magnificent boss of that night!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
