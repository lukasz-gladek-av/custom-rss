    <p><span>A new look ahead of the expansion's December 2 release.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bungie [231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> has released the launch trailer and a new video documentary for the <em>Star Wars</em>-inspired <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [48 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Renegades</em> expansion ahead of its December 2 release. <span id="more-1009343"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Today, <em>Destiny 2</em> developers hosted a dedicated Developer Live Stream for Renegades, the upcoming expansion in the Year of Prophecy, created in collaboration with <a title="Companies > Lucasfilm Games [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/lucasfilm-games">Lucasfilm Games</a> and inspired by <em>Star Wars</em>. To mark the expansion’s release next week on December 2, 2025, the team premiered the <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> launch trailer and a second ViDoc, “Making of a Renegade,” highlighting their creative process and collaboration with Lucasfilm Games to create an all-new <em>Destiny 2</em> experience with clear homage to <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><p>Renegades introduces an arsenal of new weapons and gear, including the Praxic Blade, <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s lightsaber-inspired kinetic Exotic Sword. This new weapon offers multiple customization paths that meaningfully impact gameplay, along with earnable cosmetics that alter the color of the blade. Renegades also debuts a new weapon archetype, Blasters, which features a heat-based firing and reload system that replaces traditional magazines.</p><p>New Exotics arriving with Renegades include:</p><ul><li><strong>Kinetic Sword</strong> – Praxic Blade (inspired by lightsabers)</li><li><strong>Solar Crossbow</strong> – Heirloom (inspired by Chewbacca’s iconic weapon)</li><li><strong>Strand Machine Gun</strong> – Service of Luzaku</li><li><strong>Warlock Helmet</strong> – Deimosuffusion</li><li><strong>Hunter Legs</strong> – Fortune’s Favor</li><li><strong>Titan Chest</strong> – Praxic Vestment</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During the stream, members of the <em>Destiny 2</em> developer team dove deep into the Lawless Frontier, a new activity designed for replayability and scalable challenge. In Renegades, players build reputation with shady Syndicate factions through the new Notoriety system, taking on a range of solo or three-person missions commissioned by three distinct factions:</p><ul><li><strong>The Pikers</strong> – An anarchist and atheist biker gang of Eliksni seeking to build a society free from traditional ranks and hierarchy.</li><li><strong>Tharsis Reformation</strong> – A breakaway sect of sentient Vex, driven by a desire to experience personal identity outside the Vex collective.</li><li><strong>Totality Division</strong> – A rogue branch of the Barant Imperium Cabal, operating as a Syndicate on Mars and ruled by psions.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1009348"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Job types include Smuggling runs to transport valuable goods between Syndicate facilities, Bounty Hunts that track and eliminate high-value targets, and Sabotage operations that disrupt rival Syndicate strongholds. Lawless Frontier features new maps set on Mars, <a title="Games > Europa [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/europa">Europa</a>, and Venus, expanding these destinations with fresh routes and combat spaces. The update also introduces the new Invasion mode, an opt-in feature which allows a Guardian to spawn into the playing field to disrupt progress and earn unique rewards.</p><p>Renegades Abilities are powerful tools that let Guardians bend the rules of combat within the Lawless Frontier mode. Guardians can earn, upgrade, and deploy a wide arsenal of offensive, defensive, and support abilities to enhance their abilities and role in battle.</p><p>The new dungeon, Equilibrium, launches on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251213T1700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 13, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET</a>.
