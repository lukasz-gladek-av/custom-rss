        <p>To escape from this otherworldly realm, a lone rider surveys the mysterious world in search of an exit.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dogoo Day Care</strong> – Choose from six playable characters, scour the land on your trusty bike, and collect as many variants of Dogoos as possible to win! As players progress through 15 Dogoo-filled stages, Uzume must find a way to snap her friends out of their weird fascination with Dogoos!</li><li><strong>The Dogoo Bounty Hunter</strong> – Collecting Dogoos can be a cinch, but stealing Dogoos is a whole ‘notha ball game! Certain characters shine more in close combat, while others excel in long-range attacks. Find the strengths (and weaknesses, of course!) to become a true Dogoo bounty hunter!</li><li><strong>These Dogoos Do Bike Back</strong> – As squishy and adorable as these Dogoos are, some can be quite the menace.
