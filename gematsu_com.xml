            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [422 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> and developer <a title="Companies > System Era Softworks [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/system-era-softworks">System Era Softworks</a> have released the 17-minute gameplay reveal and new information for <em><a title="Games > STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</a></em>, a new <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [614 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>-first adventure in the <em><a title="Games > Astroneer [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astroneer">ASTRONEER</a></em> series. <span id="more-998583"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>A New Kind of <em>ASTRONEER</em> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a></strong></p><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> isn’t your everyday stroll through the stars—it’s a full-blown expedition game built around cooperation, improvisation and a healthy dose of interplanetary foolishness.</p><p>Recruits begin their journey on the ESS Starseeker, an experimental space station packed with tools, supplies and the questionable leadership of the famous <a title="Genres > Action [3,115 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Science Hero superteam, the Fronteer Force. Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p><ul><li><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</li><li><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</li><li><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>First Stop: Planet Tephra</strong></p><p>The first destination for intrepid Astroneers is Tephra, a lush and mysterious planet deep in frontier space. Its tangled jungles, vast oceans and cavernous depths hold secrets, and more than a few hazards.</p><p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger <a title="Genres > Co-Op [339 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> missions.</p><p>And Tephra is just the beginning. As the Starseeker travels deeper into frontier space, the crew will uncover new worlds, each bringing its own dangers, creatures and stories tied to the Fronteer Force’s Super Top-Secret Mission mission. It’s a big mission.</p><p><strong>First Look at an Expedition</strong></p><p>In the <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> Direct demo, a Squad touched down on Tephra to help repair critical equipment for the science team. Simple enough, until it wasn’t. Local fauna had Gooped everything in sight, forcing recruits to improvise with their EXO Tools and specialized Nozzles. Nozzles are modular upgrades that transform the way explorers interact with the environment.</p><p>The Squad’s mission required the team to set up a comms relay high up on Tephra’s cliffs, all while cleaning Goop from machinery using Water Hose Nozzles, contending with rowdy creatures, and escaping the planet before time ran out. Of course, detours were made for Carrotling-chasing, Squad hijinks and general chaos. After all, what’s a Starseeker expedition without a little creative disaster?</p><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> will bring players deeper into the <em>ASTRONEER</em> universe. Whether you’re a meticulous planner, a curious explorer or just someone who really likes throwing beach balls in space, the Starseeker has a seat for you.</p></blockquote><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,565 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,055 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, Switch, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,475 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the video below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Reveal</span></h2><p><iframe title="STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions | Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5lw4PJtHmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-gameplay-reveal-video-details]]></content:encoded>
