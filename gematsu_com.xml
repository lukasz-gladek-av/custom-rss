    <p><span>Three titles currently in production, including new game from Blackbird Interactive.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Lyrical Media has announced the establishment of <a title="Companies > Lyrical Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/lyrical-games">Lyrical Games</a>, a privately funded game publisher committed to “empowering creators of high-quality indie games.” The company currently has three titles in production with “top-tier developers,” including <a title="Companies > Blackbird Interactive [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/blackbird-interactive">Blackbird Interactive</a>, the reveals of which are coming soon. <span id="more-982222"></span></p><p>Lyrical Games is headed by Blake Rochkind, the former head of business development at <a title="Companies > Take-Two Interactive Software [847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software">Take-Two Interactive Software</a>‘s <a title="Companies > Private Division [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/private-division">Private Division</a>. Rochkind is joined by Roger Kurtz, the former head of production at Private Division, and a team of games publishing veterans with “decades” of experience across companies like <a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>, <a title="Companies > Humble Games [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a>, Microsoft, and more. </p><p>According to the press release, Lyrical Games will support “imaginative and high-caliber games that live between the extremes of smaller indies and massive AAA productions.”</p><p>“From the very beginning of Lyrical Media, we set out to be a premier home for amazing storytelling regardless of medium,” said Lyrical Media founder and CEO Alexander Black in the press release. “We want to empower fiercely passionate game creators by bridging the gap between their art and the players who stand to be moved by it. Lyrical Games has the experience to know that we are nothing without our partners and their vision.”</p><p>Lyrical Games head Blake Rochkind adde,d “At Lyrical Games, we firmly believe developers are often the best stewards of their own game. In today’s landscape, there has never been more noise, and not every developer necessarily needs a publisher. We built Lyrical Games to be the kind of publisher they want to work with. In this new normal, it’s never been more important for both developers and their publishing partners to share a clear, holistic vision at the outset—not just for the game itself, but who that audience is and how they can and should be reached.”</p><p>Rochkind continued, “In the high end indie or ‘triple-i’ space, we believe we can offer among the best, if not the best, deal terms available right now. We’re not just looking for developers, but for partners who want a meaningful say in all the ways their game will be shown to the world. Developers we work with will always have ownership of their IP, and our partnerships will always value collaboration and transparency above all else.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
