Modify your team and playstyle to what you need out of the run, mixing it up when a change in tactics is required. Pick and swap from a variety of gnomes to get the job done, assign game-changing upgrades that combine in unexpected ways, and discover hidden special abilities for certain gnomes.</li><li><strong>Progress In Every Run</strong> – Venture into the caves knowing each run gets you resources no matter how they end.
