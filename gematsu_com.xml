There’s just one thing that makes his life hard: he’s so anxious about being in social situations that his head would explode if he ever talks to anyone. Fortunately, that’s never happened yet: as you’ll see, Giraffe has gotten good at sneaking around, distracting, and avoiding the overly chatty residents of Friendly City (voted friendliest city in the world!).</p><!-- AD: content -->
