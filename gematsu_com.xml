Betrayed by her organization and on a mission to overthrow the Junta, a military regime that rules the sprawl with an iron fist, SEVEN must escape the walled city and discover what secrets lie at the SPIRE.</p><p>The streets of the <em>SPRAWL</em> are vast and the armies of the corporate government seem endless. But the dark alleys and dilapidated apartment surfaces are all compatible with the “Icarus” cybernetic implant, allowing SEVEN to perform gravity-defying wall-running maneuvers and slow down time with excess adrenaline drops from dismembered enemies. With a horde of different troop types and carefully designed weapons, she will be pushed to the limit to survive.</p><p>The SPRAWL eventually consumes us all… will you fight your way out?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>Quake</em>-Like Twitch Gameplay</strong> – To escape the desolate, AI-controlled city you’re gonna need to think quickly and master your weapons in a high-speed game of combat chess.
