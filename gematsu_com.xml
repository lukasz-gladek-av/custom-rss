            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Tayutama: It’s happy days</em> first launched for PC on May 29, 2009 in Japan.</p><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p>This updated edition, supervised by Lump of Sugar, has been reimagined as an all-ages experience, partially remastered in high-definition, and localized into multiple languages.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The wild days I spent with the Tayutai were nothing short of life-changing… So much so that I completely forgot I’d even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.<br>Now that things have finally settled down, I—Yuri Mito—am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.</p><p>Just as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.</p><p>This is a story that picks up after the main events… or maybe one that could’ve happened somewhere along the way.</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>hiro Mito</strong> (voiced by Risa Matsuda)</p><p>Upon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call “intense,” and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she’s not exactly human…</p><p>Mashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that’s just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.</p><p><strong>Ameri Kawai</strong> (voiced by Kaori Hanano</p><p>The childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She’s a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro.</p><p>She can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she’s a bit on the timid side…</p><p><strong>Mifuyu Kisaragi</strong> (voiced by Rina Misaki)</p><p>She is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls’ Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She’s well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn’t mean she isn’t without her flaws.</p><p>She’s rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man…</p><p><strong>Yumina Takanashi</strong> (voiced by Yu Aoto)</p><p>Yumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.</p><p>She’s one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn’t mind working hard, and she’s actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination.</p><p><strong>Nue</strong> (voiced by Mika)</p><p>One of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.</p><p>She transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.</p><p>After Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.</p><p><strong>Ouryu</strong> (voiced by Taiyo Sorano)</p><p>One of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.</p><p>Once thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite—he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.</p><p>Though he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family’s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/remastered-romance-visual-novel-tayutama-its-happy-days-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
