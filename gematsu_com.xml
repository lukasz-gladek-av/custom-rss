Between maniac <a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [58 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> bosses, revenge-driven Idols, and enticing cult leaders, Kobayashi’s trip through Tokyo’s underworld is not only a relentless fight for <a title="Genres > Survival [440 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, but also a journey of self-discovery, filled with dark humor and unexpected twists. Paired with an unforgettable soundtrack created by legendary musician Andrew Hulshult and a story told through almost 100 pages of unique comic book panels drawn by comic artist Hans Steinbach, we believe that <em>Tokyo Underground Killer</em> will deliver a gaming experience unlike anything else.”</p><p>Here are the latest details, via Phoenix Game Productions:</p><blockquote><p>Players step into the role of Kobayashi, the feared “Shinjuku Vampire”—a notorious assassin for Japan’s most powerful <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e syndicate, Gokuraku. Cut your way through Tokyo’s back alleys in lightning-fast sword fights, harness 10 supernatural Blood Skills to summon fire tornadoes or drain enemies’ life force, and master unlockable abilities to defeat 10 uniquely challenging bosses.</p><p>To celebrate this announcement, the team has released a brand-new gameplay video, offering the most in-depth look yet at the game’s adrenaline-fueled katana combat and the gritty life of protagonist Kobayashi in Tokyo’s crime-infested underworld — a place where dazzling neon lights meet unflinching, brutal violence.</p><p>From rain-slick side streets in Shinjuku to the electric chaos of Akihabara, Tokyo Underground Killer blends over-the-top katana carnage with a neon-soaked Tokyo backdrop inspired by real-world locations</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The game is fully voiced in English and Japanese, featuring an all-star Japanese cast including the legendary Hidekatsu Shibata (<em>Naruto</em>, <em>One Piece</em>, <em><a title="Series > Dragon Ball [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/dragon-ball">Dragon Ball</a></em>) as Ishihara—Kobayashi’s ruthless crime boss.</p><p>Sharpen your blade, embrace the chaos, and carve your bloody path to freedom beneath Tokyo’s neon-soaked night.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tokyo Underground Killer - Release Date &amp; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Nkz4vwsdwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/tokyo-underground-killer-for-pc-launches-september-5]]></content:encoded>

A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p><p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Put simply, <em>Dark Deity II</em> is about playing your way, all the way.</p><p><strong>Strategize and Prevail</strong></p><p>Turn-based tactical combat is at the heart of <em>Dark Deity II</em>. Your 20 heroes have access to 45 branching classes, each with its own powerful abilities, passive effects, and its own tactical niche…</p><p>…that’s until you start experimenting with skills, abilities, and gear that can completely change the way a unit performs in the field and upend your tactics in a good way..</p><p>Heroes will bond as they fight seemingly impossible odds. Hardship forges the strongest bonds… but can also destroy friendships and wreak havoc. Will you be able to walk the line between the two?</p><p><strong>Make Your Decisions Wisely</strong></p><p>A desperate defense against an overwhelming foe. A land in the grasp of war fever, panic, and factional strife. A traitor around every corner. To have a chance at winning the war, you’ll need to make some difficult choices.</p><p>Verroa is torn apart by factions, and many of these factions are fractured in turn. Decide who to support and who to throw to the wolves—but weigh each option carefully. After all, your choices may drastically change the coming battles…</p><p>Every choice can fundamentally change the way you play the game. No two playthroughs are the same and what goes right in one game can go terribly wrong in the other.</p><p><strong>Twist the Threads of Destiny</strong></p><p>No playthroughs are going to be the same, but you can push <em>Dark Deity II</em> even further. Inspired by roguelites, we created the Twisted Destiny mode, allowing you to play through a shortened version of the campaign, featuring a randomized team on every playthrough, a host of new levels and modified existing ones, and unlock rewards for future playthroughs—which can completely change the way you play them!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dark Deity 2 - Official Nintendo Switch Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rPsCK7lotM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/dark-deity-ii-coming-to-switch-on-september-4]]></content:encoded>
