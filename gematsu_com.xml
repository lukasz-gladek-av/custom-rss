Players can expect a show packed with back-to-back exciting announcements and… that’s it. No ads, no hosts, no sponsors, just games.”</p><p>Evil Empire marketing director Berenger Dupre added, “This year, Evil Empire doesn’t have a flashy new game to unveil (sorry!), but since we loved making the show we want to keep the party going for everyone anyway. Dropping all these announcements from our corner of the gaming world in one big blast makes sure the entire show is fun to watch for our players, and for us too! We’re very thankful to all our fellow studios who worked with us to make this possible again.”</p><p>If you missed the first edition of The Triple-i Initiative in 2024, catch up on all the announcements <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/tag/the-triple-i-initiative-2024">here</a>.</p><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
