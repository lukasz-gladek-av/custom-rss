Battle your way across China with three new campaigns, commanding the forces of Shu, Wei, and Wu, each with their unique units, technologies, and heroes with devastating abilities. Additionally, explore medieval history on the fringes of China with two new civilizations: the Jurchens and Khitans!</p><p><strong>Five New Civilizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong> – Take the reins of the Kingdom of Shu and fulfil Liu Bei’s dream of restoring the Han dynasty. The Shu unique units are the White Feather Guard, an infantryman that slows down units it attacks, and the War Chariot, a vehicle that fires barrages of bolts from a large repeating crossbow.</li><li><strong>Wei</strong> – Step into the shoes of Cao Cao and dominate China with massive cavalry armies and nefarious schemes. The Wei unique units are the Tiger Cavalry, a horseman that levels up as it kills units, and the Xianbei Raider, a cavalry archer that fires storms of arrows into the enemy ranks.</li><li><strong>Wu</strong> – Lead the Sun Clan to glory through infantry and naval prowess. The Wu unique units are the Fire Archer, a ranged soldier that fires incendiary arrows, and the Jian Swordsman, a heavy infantry unit whose shield offers immense protection – until it breaks.</li><li><strong>Jurchens</strong> – Dominate the rugged terrain of northeast China with the skilled hunters, armored cavalry, and gunpowder weaponry of the Great Jin dynasty. The Jurchen unique units are the Iron Pagoda, a cavalryman that occasionally blocks melee attacks, and the Grenadier, a foot soldier who hurls deadly incendiary bombs at his enemies.</li><li><strong>Khitans</strong> – Relive the glory of the Liao dynasty and Kara-Khitai, terrorizing your enemies with mobile hordes and diabolical weapons. The Khitan unique units are the Liao Dao, an infantryman whose lethal sword slashes cause lasting damage, and the Mounted Trebuchet, a powerful siege engine carried around by camels. Additionally, instead of farming, the Khitans gather food from Pastures, which can be tended by two Villagers instead of just one.</li></ul><p>“The Three Kingdoms” also brings several new units and unit-lines for increased immersion in Chinese history:</p><ul><li><strong>Hei Guang Cavalry</strong> – Heavily armored horsemen. Regular and Elite Hei Guang Cavalry replace Knights, Cavaliers, and Paladins for the Shu, Wei, and Wu.</li><li><strong>Traction Trebuchets</strong> – Deadly, mobile engines that provide the Shu, Wei, and Wu an excellent late-game long-ranged siege option on land.</li><li><strong>Lou Chuans</strong> – Literal floating fortresses that excel against other warships and buildings alike. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Shu, Wei, and Wu.</li><li><strong>Fire Lancers</strong> – spear-wielding infantry who occasionally use an explosive ranged attack. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Khitans, Koreans, and Vietnamese.</li><li><strong>Rocket Carts</strong> – this siege engine replaces Mangonels, and instead fires a volley of incendiary rockets at enemies. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Khitans, and Koreans.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ships</strong> – the deadliest Fire Ship in the game, exclusive to the Chinese!</li></ul><p><strong>Three New Campaigns</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Romance of the Three Kingdoms through a riveting narrative from the viewpoint of all three kingdoms and their founders!</p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong><ul><li><strong>Liu Bei</strong> – In the midst of a bloody civil war, the sandal maker Liu Bei and his sworn brothers fight to restore the ailing Han dynasty. Can this honorable commoner save the empire, or will it fall into the hands of the ruthless warlord Cao Cao?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wei</strong><ul><li><strong>Cao Cao</strong> – The greatest warlord of his time, Cao Cao rises from a mere cavalry commander to the true power behind the throne of China. Will his ambitious schemes and tactical skill be enough to place his own dynasty on the throne of the Middle Kingdom?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wu</strong><ul><li><strong>The Sun Clan</strong> – After their father is murdered, the sons of the Sun Clan fight for revenge while building themselves up to be the rulers of southern China. Will their struggle make them worthy of the Mandate of Heaven, or are they doomed to become footnotes in history?</li></ul></li></ul><p>As you venture through these campaigns, you will:</p><ul><li>Relive fabled events like the Oath of the Peach Tree Garden, the Battle of Guandu, and the Battle of Red Cliffs.</li><li>Encounter legendary characters such as the notorious Lü Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the exalted Guan Yu.</li><li>Unleash their deadly heroic abilities like Green Dragon Strike, Superhuman Aim, and Exploding Bolt.</li><li>Train your favorite heroes from the Three Kingdoms era in the new Hall of Heroes building.</li><li>Experience unprecedented gameplay and narrative value as you use an interactive system to make key decisions that shape each campaign.</li><li>Choose from two new difficulty levels: Easiest offers a leisurely cruise through the story, while Legendary could test the mettle of Cao Cao himself!</li><li>Marvel at an array of new flora, fauna, and other atmospheric visuals that will fully immerse you in China’s Three Kingdoms era.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is available now for all platforms, free of charge. <span id="more-957436"></span></p><p>“We have another big surprise for <em>SaGa</em> fans: a collaboration between <em>Vampire Survivors</em> (yes, that <em>Vampire Survivors</em>!) and <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>,” said <em>SaGa</em> series general director Akitoshi Kawazu in a press release. “You may be wondering what could have possibly brought a bullet hell, <a title="Genres > Survival [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelike [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> and <em>SaGa</em> together. This collaboration was realized thanks to Luca from poncle being a fan of the <em>SaGa</em> franchise. I would never have imagined that SaGa would continue to expand in this way, so at the same time as being totally surprised, I feel a new, fresh kind of joy.”</p><p>Kawazu continued, “To the <em>SaGa</em> fans out there who haven’t experienced <em>Vampire Survivors</em> yet: please seize this opportunity to jump in and enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. And I would love for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> fans to try playing <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em> as well. But first, let’s enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em>. I’m going to be playing too—until my fingers hurt!”</p><p><em>SaGa</em> series producer <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>anori Ichikawa added, “Firstly, I’m truly delighted that this day has arrived. Thank you so much to Luca and all the creators at poncle for your love of <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>. I’ll also be diving in and enjoying this collaboration!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3451100/Vampire_Survivors_Emerald_Diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In a universe where a single level up choice can change everything, the <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> characters stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vampire Survivors, united to face their next <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,198 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> together. Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire? We doubt it, but never say never.</p><p>As the Junction opens, the Vampire Survivors are thrust into a strange system of interconnected worlds, from a wondrous enchanted witchdom to a sinister realm of bloody nightmares. Equipped with the power of Glimmers and befriended by those that understand this strange universe better than anyone, onward they step in to the unknown; united in cause, wanting to survive, and bereft of fear. Well maybe a little bit of fear.</p><p><strong>Over 12 New Characters</strong></p><p>An eclectic cast of bizarre <em>SaGa</em> protagonists join the Survivors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido</strong> – A fate-forged master of Kugutsu combat puppets.</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling</strong> – An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie and Formina</strong> – A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms.</li><li><strong>Diva No. 5</strong> – A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds (and robotic bodies) to rediscover her memories.</li><li><strong>And Many More!</strong> – Including a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies…</li></ul><p><strong>Over 16 New Weapons and the Glimmer Mechanic</strong></p><p>40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the <em>SaGa</em> series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there’s a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of<em> SaGa</em> gets represented!</p><ul><li><strong>Fleuret</strong> – Stab enough encroaching enemies and you’ll Glimmer the Crystalline Carve, letting you freeze foes whilst cutting them down.</li><li><strong>Pressure Point</strong> – Unleash a barrage of martial arts blows at close range to Glimmer the far-reaching fire jab Shenlong Firefist.</li><li><strong>Hecaton Machine Gun</strong> – Shoot a blistering salvo of interestingly inaccurate bullets to Glimmer the Bombarding Fire technique, blasting baddies with a massive upheaval of the earth.</li><li><strong>Hyperion Bazooka</strong> – Master these high-power missiles that explode as they penetrate through hordes of foes to Glimmer the Cosmic Rave to massively multiply your firepower.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Parties</strong></p><p>No <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> downloadable content is complete without a squad of odd allies to pal around with. Level up Tsunanori Mido to summon up to four Kugutsu combat puppets, fighting independently with their own weapons in a defensive cross formation. Pick either Bonnie or Formina to play as both intrepid investigators, combining punches and pistols for a powerful partnership. And in the darkness of Yomi, rumours swirl of a Dismal King who can enthral defeated foes to make his own army of allies…</p><p><strong>Showstopper</strong></p><p>Survivors never give up! When a <em>SaGa</em> character reaches critical HP they fight back from the brink with a Showstopper, a brief burst of bonus Might, decreased Cooldown, and a little extra Luck to help them survive whatever precarious situation you’ve put them in with a tempest of powered-up projectiles.</p><p><strong>A New World-Weaving Stage</strong></p><p>Follow the Emerald Wave through a diorama of interwoven worlds, the perfect setting to walk sideways while mowing down masses of unusual monsters and bonkers bosses.</p><p><strong>Remixes of Stupendous <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> Tracks</strong></p><ul><li>“A Fierce Engagement”</li><li>“A Quick Warm-Up”</li><li>“Against All Odds”</li><li>“CCPD, Moving Out!”</li><li>“Darkness Incarnate”</li><li>“Emerald Destinies”</li><li>“Feel The Beat”</li><li>“The World’s Heartbeat”</li><li>“Yumeha, Chipper As Ever!”</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,023 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,895 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,904 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,930 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/?snr=1_5_9__205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, iOS, and Android.</p><p>Watch the downloadable content announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>DLC “Emerald Diorama” Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama | Launch Trailer | OUT NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrb7lTnklrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
