Sell CDs, merch, and snacks: <em>Half-Life</em>, <em>The Sims 2</em>, and <em>Shrek</em> discs, Cheetos, beer, and Hubba Bubba. Build collections of rare merch and pogs, customize your desk, and play retro mini-games. Cheat customers (if your conscience allows) and chat with them to solve their problems or guess their preferences. By stocking the right products, you can turn your humble little shop into the ultimate geek destination—or a shady spot black market goods.</p><p>Maybe then the emo girl will take you seriously? The game blends colorful pixel art in third-person view with first-person <a title="Platforms > PS1 [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps1">PlayStation 1</a>-inspired 3D graphics.</p><p>The sound effects are inspired by 8-bit games and <em>The Sims</em> series.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
