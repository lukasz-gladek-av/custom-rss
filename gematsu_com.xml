      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Kitfox Games [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kitfox-games">Kitfox Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Freehold Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/freehold-games">Freehold Games</a> will release science fantasy <a title="Genres > Roguelike [349 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike game</a> <em><a title="Games > Caves of Qud" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves of Qud</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> in Q4 2025, the companies announced. <span id="more-983083"></span></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> first launched in Early Access for PC on July 15, 2015, followed by a full release on December 5, 2024. It is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p><p>Do anything and everything. <em>Caves of Qud</em> is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [802 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [17,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [146 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Announcement Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGueIQVO_fY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/caves-of-qud-coming-to-switch-in-q4-2025]]></content:encoded>
