Sign-ups for the closed beta test are available <a href="https://jumpshipgame.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. <span id="more-946239"></span></p><p>“Our goal was to create a game that balances the fun and immersion of space exploration,” said Keepsake Games CEO Daniel Kaplan in a press release. “Coming from <a title="Companies > Hazelight [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hazelight">Hazelight</a>, Mojang, and Coffee Stain, we understand how to make a great co-op game, and we’ve reached a point where player input is vital in order for us to make <em>Jump Ship</em> as good as it can be. That’s why we’re releasing into Early Access this summer—to work directly with our players, listen to their feedback, and combine it with our vision.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coffee Stain Publishing:</p><blockquote><p><em>Jump Ship</em> is a mission based co-op FPS in which players can transition seamlessly from crewing their very own space ship to on-foot exploration and space walks. The goal of each mission is to survive with the crew’s ship intact and make the next jump, picking up valuable resources, blueprints and weapons along the way. While one crewmate is piloting the ship, another might be putting out fires or fixing radiation leaks on the deck, while the rest of the group boards enemy vessels or battle through volatile space stations to make off with precious supplies.</p><p>In <em>Jump Ship</em>, the galaxy is filled with handcrafted celestial settings, from vast asteroid rings dominating the horizon to distant, luminescent nebulas radiating kaleidoscopic light. The scenery changes with each jump, as players go from boarding and pillaging a rival corvette-class ship to salvaging shipwrecks floating in vacuum or exploring an abandoned research facility.</p><p>However, deep space hides many other, more celestial threats, as solar flares and meteor showers regularly threaten to end players’ spacefaring journeys in an instant.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
