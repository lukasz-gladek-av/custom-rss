It’s a chaotic crossover that blends the frantic havoc of Raccoon Logic Studios’ <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> with the delightfully disastrous <a title="Genres > Management [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> mayhem fans know and fear.</p><p>Available now on <a title="Platforms > PC [25,142 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,496 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, this latest update brings a new rift to <em>Two Point Museum</em>, launching the game into the furthest reaches of the Digiverse, where alien oddities, bizarre biology, and nonsensical science collide.</p><p>Curators are now officially encouraged (not legally required) to curate the galaxy. Following the discovery of a mysterious rift, brave curators will hop from planet to planet exploring three distinct Points of Interest and recover exhibits from the strange and savage world of <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. Along the way, curators will wrangle temperamental life forms and bitey flora such as Arid Maw and Fungal Maw and delight visitors with exhibits that are as colourful as they are unpredictably mischievous. Survival-lite expeditions, unexpected experiments, and scientifically questionable discoveries await every curator!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1016271"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>There are six brand-new exhibits to recover, plus new Staff Room additions focused on “team bonding” rather than safety. Curators can install a High-Five Machine and a staff-sized <a title="Companies > Hamster Corporation [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hamster-corporation">Hamster</a> Wheel, then dress staff for interstellar duty in a brand-new outfit—helmets optional, common sense unavailable.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Experts can explore the world of <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>, visiting Stellaris Prime, Xephyr, and the Zenithian <a title="Platforms > Rift" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/rift">Rift</a>.</li><li>Collect six new exhibits, including Botany Exhibits as well as new <a title="Games > Terrarium" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/terrarium">Terrarium</a> and Habitat creatures.</li><li>Create a real sci-fi feel with new decorative items and a new vending machine.</li><li>Get ready for interstellar travel with a new Staff Outfit and Staff Room items.</li><li>Discover a brand-new set of Materials for creating items in the Workshop.</li></ul><p>With cosmic chaos, environmental oddities, and classic Two Point mischief, <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> proves once again that museum management is challenging, adventurous, and deeply unwise—especially when alien biology meets corporate ambition.</p><p>Not only that, but for the first time ever, players can also discover <em>Two Point Museum</em> goodies in another universe, exploring Pointian exhibits in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch 2, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
