A release date was not announced. <span id="more-968876"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Unbound Creations:</p><blockquote><p><em>Table Tactics</em> is a unique blend of strategy and physics, played with little miniature figurines. Imagine you are staring at your kitchen table where you laid out a little fantasy diorama and carefully placed miniatures to defend your castle. Alas, enemy units are coming from all directions! But instead of decreasing their health or worrying about armor, you must physically knock them over by shooting various projectiles (like arrows or marbles), using traps, or pushing them off the table. You’ll need to take the shape and weight of each figurine into consideration.</p><p>The archers are your basic unit—they shoot an arrow which, when aimed well, can topple almost any figurine. The Catapult flings heavy marbles that roll around—great for big groups of enemies! And the Mage can cast an explosive fireball, knocking everything in its blast radius. There are many more units to collect and alter your playstyle.</p><p>As you complete levels and challenges, you will earn gold coins to buy and trade new miniatures. Build a custom roster, experiment with synergies, and create the most powerful tabletop physics army!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
