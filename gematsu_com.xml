The goal of each mission is to survive with the crew’s ship intact and make the next jump, picking up valuable resources, blueprints and weapons along the way.</p><p>First revealed in 2024, <em>Jump Space</em> has seen more than 500,000 players navigate nebulas and explore galaxies during the recent June Steam Next Fest, reaching the “Top 3 Most Played Demos” during the event. As the spacefaring adventure approaches its Early Access release, more than one million players have now wishlisted the game on Steam in anticipation of the title’s release.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/jump-ship-renamed-jump-space]]></content:encoded>
