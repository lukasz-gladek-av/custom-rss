By battling and customizing Beyblades, players can experience the excitement of actual bey battles in a form only a game can offer. This time, three further evolutions have been added.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features (Evolutions)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>EVOBATLE</strong> – <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> was well-received for its “X (Extreme) Dash” and tactical yet action-packed bey battles in “X (Extreme) Line”-equipped stadiums. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, tactics and methods of attack and defense vary significantly depending on actual type affinities and characteristics, evolving into “ultra high-speed action” where instant command actions are the key to victory. Players can continue to battle online against bladers from around the world and challenge each other for the top spot.</li><li><strong>EVOSTORY</strong> – In single-player mode, players can enjoy an all-new original story featuring new characters such as Tenka Shiroboshi (voiced by Yuko Natsuyoshi), who has joined the protagonist’s team in the <em>Beyblade X</em> anime, along with a cast of unique, game-original characters. Compete with new allies and aim for victory in the “Bey <a title="Genres > Battle Royale [48 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">Battle Royale</a>.”</li><li><strong>EVOCUSTOMIZATION</strong> – In 2025, <em>Beyblade X</em> introduces the “CX (Custom Line),” expanding the possibilities for customization. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, players can enjoy this wider range of customization, as well as collect materials to coat their Beyblades in their favorite colors. Build a one-of-a-kind Beyblade to stand out from your rivals.</li></ul><p><strong>Save Data Bonus</strong></p><p>Players with save data from <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> will receive “reward money” in <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> based on their game progress. Use reward money to enhance your beys or buy your favorites in the shop. Additionally, players who purchased paid digital boosters can also carry over the “blades” of Beyblades they previously obtained into <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>.</p><p><strong>Bundle Bonus: Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</strong></p><p>All physical editions of <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> will include an actual “<em>Beyblade X</em> CX-00 Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.” This is a new model in a limited edition color only available by purchasing the physical edition of the game.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a teaser trailer and video for the bundle bonus below.</p><h2><span>Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="『ベイブレードエックス エボバトル』ティザームービー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvigSv1NauM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</span></h2><p><iframe title="【ベイブレード開発者レビュー】レオンファングT4-60A レッドVer.【ベイブレードエックス エボバトル特典】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIyxpYkYMdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
