A demo is available now. <span id="more-931778"></span></p><p>“<em>The Great Villainess</em> explores an alternate reality where mass media could be perceived as mystical powers,” said WSS playground CEO Daichi Saito in a press release. “We encourage all who test the demo to lend their voice to development, we look forward to your feedback!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via the companies:</p><blockquote><p>Escape false murder accusations as Scarlet, a hedonistic duchess guilty only of disobeying the aristocracy’s tiresome customs. Flee the imperial armies eager to see Scarlet’s head roll and buy time until she can clear her name. Conspire with Lily, a time-traveling live streamer, and convince the opposing generals of Scarlet’s innocence, win their loyalty…and perhaps even form a rebellion.</p><p>In an era without the internet, leverage the power of media to outwit enemy forces. Hop aboard an imperial airship, spread (occasionally fake) news from above, and sway public opinion to increase the odds of victory during every battle. </p><p>Strengthen Scarlet’s army with her winsome ways: capture prisoners of war, then sway them with propaganda. Plant seeds of doubt into the minds of opposing commanders to cut off supply chains, divert troops away from battlegrounds, and flank distracted squadrons to thin out their ranks.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
