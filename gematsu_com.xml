We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft <em>Marathon</em> into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23 release.</p><p>The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">FPS</a> combat.</p><p>We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like <em>Marathon</em> is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Over the next few months, we’ll continue closed testing(including participants from the Alpha) to deploy gameplay updates and test new features as they come online.</p><p>Some of our immediate focus areas will be:</p><ul><li>Upping the <a title="Genres > Survival [428 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Game<ul><li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li><li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li><li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li></ul></li><li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe<ul><li>Increased visual fidelity</li><li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li><li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li></ul></li><li>Adding more social experiences<ul><li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li><li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li></ul></li></ul><p>You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date. Thank you again for your patience and—much more importantly—your passion.
