According to EC Digital Entertainment, this mode uses artificial intelligence-assisted techniques to improve certain visual elements, “while keeping the core experience in tact.” The use of this mode is completely optional, and players can switch between original and enhanced visuals at any time.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><!-- AD: content -->
