Originally we had planned to launch winter 2025, but despite great development progress this year, we’ve made the difficult decision to shift the release into next year.</p><p><em>Witchbrook</em> is a big project—and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Map of Mossport</strong></p><p>So far we’ve been quiet about the size of the game world, but today we’d like to reveal the first look at our map of Mossport! While the map highlights the sheer scale of the physical world you’ll be exploring, we’re also hard at work filling the world with spellbinding stories, captivating quests, and enchanting systems to enrich your time at Witchbrook College.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Witchbrook-World-Map_10-15-25.jpg"></a></figure><p>(View the full interactive version of the map <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p><p>It’s really important to note here that the colored areas you see here on the map are playable areas!</p><p>Whether it’s hiking through the peaceful green trails of Shadhollow Forest with its concealed paths and ancient secrets, or breathing in the salty sea breeze on the golden beaches of Parasol Sands, Mossport is full of natural beauty and diverse locations.</p><p>Often home to festivals and markets, Mossport’s high street is the lively heart of the city, with shops to browse, delicacies to sample, and friendly faces to meet. Whilst the Student Village buzzes with energy beneath the grand facade of Witchbrook College, housing a lively community of young witches.</p><p>When you need a step back, Shadbrook Cottage and its verdant garden offer a quiet retreat to transform how you see fit. Just down the lane you’ll find peaceful farmlands, and even a secluded spot to fish along the winding river. Each area connects naturally to the next, creating a world that feels lived-in, warm, and ready for you to explore.</p><p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p><p>The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them.</p><p>We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in <em>Witchbrook</em>, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customization arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another “The <em>Witchbrook</em> Oracle” already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, passion and continued support.</p><p>—Chucklefish</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

After a mysterious alien race arrives, referred to as the Occupants, bringing with it a terrible disease, humanity is all but wiped out. The survivors head underground and begin to serve the ALLMOTHER who rules this new society.</p><p>Iris, one of six “Sisters” with specific roles, has great responsibility as a Watcher and is provided access to all of the ALLMOTHER’s memories including the tragedy of how humanity was wiped out. However, when a fellow Sister uncovers the ALLMOTHER’s lies and is executed for her treason, Iris must resist all that she has been taught and fight to uncover the truth.</p><p>The Peabody-award winning and Hugo and Nebula-nominated game received high praise in 2024 and was featured on several game of the year lists, for its rich narrative, striking soundtrack, and more than 10 hours of fully voiced dialogue. As the hit title comes to more platforms and languages, Fellow Traveller and sunset visitor are delighted to share it with more players for the first time.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
