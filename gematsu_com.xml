A release date for Early Access was not announced. <span id="more-1015200"></span></p><p>“We want to create a game that evolves thanks to those who play it,” said The Breach Studios CEO Ferran Punti in a press release. “Kickstarter and Early Access will allow us to work hand in hand with motivated, invested, and passionate players. We will carefully listen to this community, which shares our love of rich and satisfying game mechanics, to tune and perfect the experience before the console release. That is why choosing to work with Radical Theory as a strategic partner felt natural as they understand and support studios through their experience, deep expertise, and genuine transparency.”</p><p>Radical Theory CEO Luc Heninger added, “It is a real pleasure to collaborate with the team at The Breach Studios – developers who are as passionate as they are friendly and talented. <em>Westlanders</em> won us over in the first few minutes of gameplay, as the Western setting is still rarely explored in the survival-crafting genre. We have a true sandbox experience here that will allow players from all backgrounds to experiment with rich, deep mechanics. The idea is to have a blast with friends, as we want players to dive into building, fighting, and resource management in co-op as quickly as possible.”</p><div id="carousel_1015208"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Radical Theory:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Forge your legacy in the Westlands.</p><p>Survive a wild-west open-world teeming with riches and fraught with perils. Alone or with your friends, brave unforgiving landscapes and conquer the wilds from your customizable mobile base: The Wagon.</p><p>But don’t just survive; thrive. Lay the foundations for bustling outposts and settlements, recruit loyal companions, and weave a powerful economic network to tame the wilderness and build your legacy.</p><p><strong>Welcome to the Westlands</strong></p><p>“Our dream was simple. Make the trip to the Westlands and find a place to call home. A land of peace and prosperity where we could raise a place to call our own from dust. We saw it in every sun-drenched clearing, in every vast, untamed vista. But this land gives with one hand and takes with the other. After all this journey, all these perils, the outlaws came in like a storm in the dead of night, leaving only fire, ashes, and a single survivor. Me.</p><p>“Now, the dream of my companions is my mission. Their legacy, my burden. I’ll forge here our future—this place we’ll call home.”</p><p>—Westlands, unknown date, from the Survivor’s journal.</p><p><strong>A Solo and Cooperative Survival Journey in a Far West Setting</strong></p><p>Imagine the rich, atmospheric Wild West open reminiscent of The Revenant, where you craft your own story. Now, layer in the base-building and crafting of <em>Medieval Dynasty</em>, the unforgiving wilderness of <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em>, and the sandbox freedom of <em><a title="Games > Palworld [40 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a></em>.</p><p>These inspirations shaped our ambition with <em>Westlanders</em>. We set out to put a fresh spin on the now-familiar survival formula by placing it in the fantasy of the Wild West. Whether playing solo or with up to four players in cooperative play, you’ll carve out a life in a land that feels both legendary and dangerously alive. Explore, fight, gather resources, craft tools, climb skill trees, and build a network of settlements to bring prosperity to the Valley.</p><p><strong>Explore the Lands on Your Mobile Base: The Wagon</strong></p><p>Within minutes of starting the game, you’ll be repairing your wagon and setting off on the open road. The concept of a horse-drawn mobile base of operations is what truly sets our game apart. We wanted to eliminate the frustration common in traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [497 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>, where exploration is limited by small inventories and base-building comes too late. In <em>Westlanders</em>, you’ll dive straight into the Wild West aboard your own custom wagon. More than just transportation, your wagon is your home, your workshop, and your progression hub. Explore a vast, untamed world without constraints. Upgrade and expand your mobile camp with new tools and countless enhancements to conquer the wilderness.</p><p><strong>Build Outposts, Recruit Citizens, Create a Full Economy</strong></p><p>Your journey isn’t just about discovery; it’s shaped by your choices. Scout the perfect location to establish your base camp, a place where you can harness the land’s riches while living in harmony with nature.</p><p>From a humble camp, you can grow into a thriving settlement, pushing your reach further. Weave a vital economic network between your outposts to ensure they thrive. Attract and recruit other wanderers, each with unique skills and professions. Recruit the talent you need—from master craftsmen to steadfast guards—to help you forge a prosperous settlement in the wilderness.”</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Survive the Untamed Wilderness</strong> – Endure a dynamic, living open world teeming with bustling flora, fierce fauna, and intriguing inhabitants.

We want to create memorable titles, something we would play on our own when we’re back home. It’s in our studios DNA to create experiences to share together with friends and that are inherently social in nature. To create games that awake that sense of immersion, thrill and discovery that we believe videogames convey in a unique way. It is with this spirit we’ve created <em>Westlanders</em>. We are fans of survival, exploration, crafting and management titles. We love games like <em>ARK</em>, <em><a title="Games > Valheim [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a></em>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em><a title="Games > Factorio [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a></em>, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative games</a>… and we like Westerns since we’re kids. We’ve of course played too much of <em><a title="Games > Red Dead Redemption [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> series, and we wanted to see what could happen if we combined <em>ARK</em> with the mood of <em>Red Dead</em>—this is how <em>Westlanders</em> is born.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.
