We needed to take into account the schedules and certification needs of multiple platform holders and multiple physical distribution companies, as well as Retroware’s release schedule, which is jam-packed this fall. We considered the option of staggering the launch and releasing on some platforms before others, but in the end we decided a simultaneous release was worth preserving at all costs.”</p><p>Kankanahalli continued, “In the end, this small delay is a good thing for <em>Neon Inferno</em>. We get even more time to polish the experience and make it as amazing as possible for you, and we may get to throw in some new features and new content originally planned for post-release. <em>Neon Inferno</em> will be an even better game this way, and you will be able to feel it.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Retroware:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Taking inspiration from classic titles like <em>Contra</em> and <em>Wild Guns</em>, <em>Neon Inferno</em> splits the <a title="Genres > Action [3,026 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> into the foreground and background with a variety of enemies and bosses in levels set in a dystopian New York City of 2055.</p><!-- AD: content -->
