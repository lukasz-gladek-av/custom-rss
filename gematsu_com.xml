May They guide you to compassion and enlightenment.</li><li>Brant (5-Star) – In the face of danger and adversity, the stage is set for our grandest act!</li><li>Changli (5-Star) – Eons of time on this vast land, all encapsulated in a humble game… I am fortunate to have you as my opponent.</li><li>Lumi (4-Star) – Hehe, busy days, but it feels great to be needed… I should keep it up!</li><li>Chixia (4-Star) – Jinzhou Patroller, Chixia. You can always call on me if you ever find yourself in a pickle!</li><li>Aalto (4-Star) – Well, if it isn’t my loyal patron! What do you wish to inquire about today?</li><li>Youhu (4-Star) – Here you go, a special edition of my poetry collection, hand-signed by moi! You are welcome!</li><li>Taoqi (4-Star)- Phew… All set. Time for a little break.</li><li>Mortefi (4-Star) – Fine, since you’ve done this much for me… Go ahead, tell me the wildest inventions you can think of, and watch me make them happen for you.</li></ul><p><strong>New Content</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Old Man and the Whale</strong> – To the north of Ragunna City lies Rinascita’s largest fishing ground—the Riccioli Islands—an enticing destination for an intriguing <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,028 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>. Ready your sails and prepare for the vast blue waters, Captain!</li><li><strong>Apex Ragunna</strong> – After a decade of anticipation, the long-awaited Carnevale has reignited a fiery passion that refuses to fade. The Water City has just unveiled a corner of its secrets. Now is the best time to set sail, ride the winds, and venture into the uncharted corners of this mysterious land. With the world’s curtain lifting, a new exploration calls! Dive into the adventure now!</li><li><strong>Whimpering Wastes</strong> – Born of evil tides, swarms of Tacet Discords weave a deadly web, luring every passing soul… Once again, it falls to you to cleanse these treacherous waters.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>New Echoes</strong></p><ul><li>Golde Junrock</li><li>Calcified Junrock</li><li>Aero Prism</li><li>Rage Against the Statue</li><li>Hurriclaw</li></ul><p><strong>New Regions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vault Underground</strong> – Tucked beneath the Sea of Clouds lies a vast depository zone of the Averardo Vault. Each item moved to the Vault will be meticulously transported to its designated storage location, where it will be safeguarded with the utmost care and precision.</li><li><strong>Riccioli Islands</strong> – A group of islands northwest of Ragunna, rich in various marine resources. Falling out of the governance of the Order of the Deep, these islands have preserved the customs from Rinascita’s Age of a Thousand Islands era, setting them apart from the rest of Ragunna in lifestyle. However, rumor has it a great mystery lies hidden within this secluded paradise…</li><li><strong>Ragunna</strong> – Ragunna City, the administrative center of the Ragunna city-state in Rinascita, is a thriving port city by the sea, its districts linked by winding waterways. The Ragunnesi are devout followers of the Sentinel, who believe Common Echoes to be gifts from the Sentinel carrying Their divine will.</li><li><strong>Whisperwind <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong> – Whisperwind Haven stretches across a vast plain outside Ragunna, adorned with uniquely shaped windmills and babbling streams. When the wind sweeps through, the windmills turn in graceful unison, rippling the streams below. Together, the wind and water merge harmoniously, flowing into the mystical sea of clouds.</li><li><strong>Penitent’s End</strong> – This forsaken island, shrouded in dense sea mist, is dominated by steep cliffs with giant ringed structures. Ships caught in the currents often end up stranded on the island’s treacherous shores. For those lucky enough to survive the wreck, even greater <a title="Genres > Horror [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s await…</li><li><strong>Fagaceae Peninsula</strong> – This peninsula thick with oak trees was once where Rinascita’s rulers gathered for secret councils. The Oracles carved into the stone and trees have withstood the passage of time, though their messages are now nearly impossible to distinguish.</li><li><strong>Nimbus Sanctum</strong> – The sea of clouds lingering in this place is formed by concentrated Remnant Energy. Local legends of Ragunna speak of a serene, mirror-like area at the heart of Nimbus Sanctum, said to purify the darkest of thoughts and transform them into part of the clouds. At times, a haunting melody can be heard echoing from the depths of the sanctum.</li><li><strong>Averardo Vault</strong> – Built by the Montelli family, Averardo Vault stands like a heavily guarded fortress on the outskirts of the city. Within its walls lies the family’s vast collection of treasures, including precious metals, artworks, and rare Echoes. The vault also provides public services such as secure storage for valuables, appraisals, and acquisition of rare collections.</li><li><strong>Thessaleo Fells</strong> – The rugged mountains of Thessaleo Fells always seem shrouded in the darkness of night, their gloom as deep as the abyssal sea. Once the domain of the Fisalia family, the oldest lineage in Ragunna, this desolate place remains one few outsiders dare to tread.</li></ul><p><strong>Optimizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Echo Presets</strong> – Echo Presets allow you to easily save and apply customized Echo lineups for your Resonator. Select any saved preset and use “Apply” to equip the preset to the current Resonator.</li><li><strong>Echo Recommendation</strong> – On the Echo Selection page, use “Suggest” to open the filter. This allows you to check the most commonly used Mainstats and Substats for the current Resonator and quickly filter out suitable Echoes. On the Resonator – Echo page, use “Suggest” to check the most commonly used Sonata Effect for the current Resonator. Use “Auto Equip” to equip all Echoes that best match the selected Sonata Effect. In addition, the Echo storage space has been expanded to 3,000.</li><li><strong>Camera Optimizations</strong><ul><li><strong>Idle Poses</strong> – Capture stunning photos of your Resonators in their idle animation poses.</li><li><strong>More Controls</strong> – Explore more compositions with the addition of Camera Filters, adjustable Filter Intensity, and free horizontal &amp; vertical camera movement.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Ray-Traced Global Illumination</strong></p><p>Ray-Traced Global Illumination will be officially available upon Version 2.1 update.
