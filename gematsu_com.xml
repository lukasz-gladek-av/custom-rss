    <div><p><a title="Companies > Bellring Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bellring-games">Bellring Games</a> will host the second beta test for third-person <a title="Genres > Action [2,641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> player-versus-player-versus-environment extraction <a title="Genres > RPG [17,129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > Mistfall Hunter [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mistfall-hunter">Mistfall Hunter</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,811 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> starting <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250422T0100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 21 at 6:00 p.m. PT / 9:00 p.m. ET</a>, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3282300/view/496065342750066730?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-956486"></span></p><p>The second beta test will introduce the following new features:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>New Class</strong><ul><li><strong>Seer (Reverent Build)</strong> – The Reverent Seer build will be available in this test. Reverent Seers use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class with support capabilities. Rune Pillars are their signature mechanic. They can summon supportive runes for healing, shielding, and <a title="Genres > Stealth [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>. They also have offensive runes that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies, shifting the course of battle. A well-timed death prevention spell can turn the tide in an instant.</li></ul></li><li><strong>New Scenes and Areas</strong><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Mistchasers, a vast new region north of Brandrgarde has been uncovered. The Ember Iris, which flourishes in abundance, is the signature feature of <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a> Iris. However, the mysterious ancient arrays and seal gates are what truly capture the Gylden Hunters’ attention. The Forge, where <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to artisans and laborers who have become the Corroded, alongside its eternally burning furnace fires.</li><li>With the addition of new areas, Brandrgarde has become too large, so we’ve split the entire fortress into two maps. Each time you explore, you’ll be placed in one of these maps at random.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Solo Mode</strong> – Solo mode shares the same maps as trio mode, but we’ve redesigned monster placement for a smoother experience. Balancing classes for solo play is particularly challenging, and we welcome your feedback during testing.</li><li><strong>New Monsters</strong> – This test introduces several new monsters, including the Warden, Prison Guard, Nightwatcher, and Penitent. We’ve also completed the second phase of Otto, the Flesheater. Good luck taking them on! Additionally, if you’re lucky enough to find a Dried Flower Knot while exploring the fortress, you can unlock the Einherjar mode challenge against Otto, the Flesheater. This mode offers better rewards, but we strongly advise Gylden Hunters to prepare well in advance.</li><li><strong>Camp</strong> – Although the camp scene and its NPCs are not yet complete, we are moving forward with testing the camp system first. Using various resources gathered during your Brandrgarde explorations, you can upgrade different features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, expanded Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. Additionally, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage, making it easier for Gylden Hunters to experience multiple classes.</li><li><strong>Optimizations and Adjustments</strong><ul><li><strong>Class Balance</strong><ul><li>To address the disadvantages of melee classes in PvE, we’ve added extra PvE damage bonus/damage reduction attributes for melee classes. We’ve also improved overall dodge performance and reduced performance differences caused by dodge animation variations across classes.</li><li>Next week, we’ll publish a separate detailed announcement regarding class balance changes for PvP. Some classes and builds will be buffed with new abilities, while certain overpowered skills and traits will be specifically nerfed. As always, we’ll continue making swift balance adjustments based on your feedback throughout this test.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Progression Adjustments</strong><ul><li>This test will introduce legendary accessories, providing higher equipment progression goals. As we’re currently developing female character models for all classes, the tight 3D pipeline schedule has delayed the completion of the other legendary equipment. We’ll complete the female character models and remaining legendary equipment as soon as possible.</li><li>We’ve removed fixed affixes from some equipment and expanded the variety of available randomly generated affixes. Equipment now has a chance to spawn with affixes higher than Lv. 1, offering more powerful rare equipment and allowing for more complex build customization.</li><li>We’ve also removed attribute growth from level progression to reduce the imbalance created by large attribute gaps between new and veteran players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core Quality Improvements</strong><ul><li>We’ve optimized input buffering overall, added support for multi-directional dodging, and fixed issues that led to damage loss and animation hitching. We’ve also enhanced basic character models, improved basic animations, such as walking and running, optimized lighting effects in certain scenes, and increased texture resolution in some areas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performance Optimizations</strong><ul><li>The minimum supported graphics card requirements have been lowered to: NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, with plans to expand device support for additional devices in the future. We’ve also focused on optimizing issues like crashes from memory leaks and frame rate instability under certain conditions. This test will introduce FSR functionality (FSR Super Resolution is available only for graphics cards that don’t support DLSS Super Resolution, while FSR Frame Generation can be enabled on any graphics card).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Team <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Improvements</strong><ul><li>Added a Friends system and completed the formal team-up feature. You can now invite friends to explore Brandrgarde together at any time.</li><li>Added the Fill Team feature—when challenging trio mode with this option enabled, the system will first assemble a full three-player team for you before entering combat.</li><li>Added real-time voice chat for teams, allowing Gylden Hunters to communicate during gameplay.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Localization Support</strong><ul><li>This test will add localization support for Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese. Additional languages will be added gradually in the future.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Others</strong><ul><li>Added an execution mechanic in trio mode, allowing players to quickly finish off downed enemies.</li><li>Added an in-game emote system, with eight emotes currently available.</li><li>Added the Journey system—complete challenges to earn rewards that will aid in your Gylden Hunt.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mistfall Hunter</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Beta 2 Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Mistfall Hunter - BETA 2 Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEhuO0P923Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
