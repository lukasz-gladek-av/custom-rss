    <p><span>A sequel to Morkull Ascend to the Gods.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Dojo System [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/dojo-system">Dojo System</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Disaster Games [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/disaster-games">Disaster Games</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Morkull Ragast's Rage [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/morkull-ragasts-rage">Morkull Ragast’s Rage</a></em> sequel <em><a title="Games > Morkull Ascend to the Gods" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/morkull-ascend-to-the-gods">Morkull Ascend to the Gods</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,899 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,010 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,845 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4108490/Morkull_Ascend_to_the_Gods/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1007502"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Dojo System:</p><blockquote<strong><p>About</p><p><em>Morkull Ascend to the Gods</em> is a 2D <a title="Genres > Action [3,220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action video game</a> focused on boss battles, once again taking control of the charismatic God of Death: Morkull.</p><p>Set in the original world of <em>Morkull Ragast’s Rage</em>, locked up and aware that he is in a new video game, you must help him escape so that he can carry out his evil plans for the world and rule by subjecting everyone to his will (yes, including you).</p><p>You will feel the power and bear the weight of being the God of Death and Darkness. A select series of battles against other henchmen, minions, and Gods that make up the Olympus of the Kingdom of Midaldus await you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But don’t worry, don’t tremble. You won’t be alone. You’ll have Morkull (or rather, he’ll have you), who has a wide range of combos, skills, and charms that you can unlock, equip, and build to your liking before each battle.</p><p>Although you’ll also die a good handful of times.</p><p>Morkull is back!</p><p>This means that his charisma, character, and personality, along with his breaking of the fourth wall, will create a lighthearted atmosphere at all times (you’re going to need it), loaded with bad jokes, references, and memes that are very present in pop culture.</p><p>It’s like having a friend playing alongside you.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Morkull Ascend to the Gods</em> is completely hand-drawn and animated, with great care and frame by frame. In this way, thanks to traditional animation, the characters’ movements are very natural and full of life.</p><p>Distinguished by a stylized character and a wide color palette, this time, outside of Ragast, you will be able to see and discover other environments that belong to the Kingdom of Midaldus.</p><p>Morkull is back! So get back in trouble with him and join his ranks by supporting his Machiavellian cause.</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Morkull Ascend to the Gods | Announcement trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9hshIu9Z70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></blockquote<strong></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/morkull-ascend-to-the-gods-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > HITMAN World of Assassination [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">HITMAN World of Assassination</a></em> limited-time <a title="Games > Elusive [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elusive">Elusive</a> Target mission “Eminem vs. Slim Shady,” which will be available for free from December 1 to 31. <span id="more-1008521"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Playable for free starting December 1</strong></p><p>Rap icon Eminem joins <em>HITMAN World&nbsp;of Assassination</em> both as himself and his twisted alter ego, Slim Shady. In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper attempted to put his other self away, but now Eminem recruits the legendary assassin Agent 47 to put his past away permanently. In a surreal new mission crafted by Eminem in collaboration with IO Interactive and creative director / producer Paul Rosenberg, the level is packed with dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s unhinged reality. Operatives find themselves in a medical facility in Hokkaido that has been twisted into the Popsomp Hills Asylum. Agent 47 will have to track Slim Shady across multiple areas, such as his broadcasting studio, to take him out without being detected. There are abundant Eminem references in the mission from throughout the rapper’s discography, such as a poisoned plate of the iconic Mom’s Spaghetti and a performance of “Houdini.”</p><p><strong>The Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Live Updates, Free for <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em>&nbsp;Players</strong></p><p>A new roadmap will start with the Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady set to bring new content to players, in addition to the new Elusive Target. Players will be able to face two new challenges, two new Featured Contracts batches, as well as three returning Elusive Targets, including The Splitter featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and two returning events: Holiday Hoarders and Hokkaido Snow Festival. Two new Twitch Drops will be available to redeem, with the Bomb-Ass Dynamite, and the Solstice Suit, which can be earned by watching thirty minutes of <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em> on Twitch during specific time periods.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
