    <p><span>Run an amusement park in Fontaine.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Paralogism,” will launch on May 7, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-961236"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update features a new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, leading players to Mondstadt where an unexpected storm brews. Meanwhile, a new amusement park opens its doors in Fontaine, challenging players to manage its operations with both wisdom and courage. Two new characters will also join the adventure: Escoffier, the former chef of Hotel Debord who can whip up delicious dishes with ease, and Ifa, a seasoned sauro-vet who fights alongside his saurian companion, Cacucu.</p><p>In the latest Archon Quest Interlude, players’ joyous return to Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival takes a sharp turn for the worse as an unexpected trial places Albedo in the crosshairs of all. Travelers will find themselves thrown into an investigation and more alongside Venti, familiar faces from the Knights of Favonius, new allies like Dahlia, as well as the Hexenzirkel’s very own Lady Alice.</p><p>As danger looms beyond the courtroom, signs of a greater threat begin to emerge with monsters invading the city. In a key negotiation with Lady Alice, Travelers must undergo a magical trial to secure her support and defend Mondstadt from the encroaching darkness. The mage’s trial arrives as a new Weekly Boss Challenge, unfolding in a dramatic battle upon a mystical chessboard. Face the King and Queen, uncover the secrets of the board, and prevail against this onslaught of powerful foes!</p><p>A brand-new management gameplay event is coming to Fontaine: The Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, starring Navia alongside familiar faces from Fontaine and Natlan as you work together to run an amusement park. Through managing three main attractions—Eclectic Escapades, Movie Masterpieces, and Mellow Manor—players can grow their park by upgrading facilities and improving Service Value by recruiting and training employees. Along the way, helpful “Friendly Encounters” and even a local chef may offer valuable management techniques or buffs. Clever use of Action Points during each business cycle is key to maximizing revenue and unlocking Performance Rewards, including the exclusive 4-star bow, Sequence of Solitude.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>But Fontaine is home to more surprises yet! Players will soon cross paths with Escoffier, a new 5-star Cryo polearm wielder and the former head chef of the famous Hotel Debord. Her combat style blends culinary flair with elemental power. Escoffier’s Elemental Skill allows her to summon the All-Spectrum Multi-Use <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a> Mek, which can either stay in place to absorb Elemental Attacks and prepare food items, or follow the active character to serve up continuous blasts of Cryo DMG. Beyond dishing out damage, Escoffier also brings reliable support to the table. Her Elemental Burst heals allies, and both her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst reduce enemies’ Hydro and Cryo RES, an effect that strengthens with more Hydro or Cryo teammates.</p><p>Another new playable character is a familiar face from Natlan: Ifa, a new 4-star Anemo catalyst user from the Flower-Feather Clan who soars into battle with his Qucusaurus companion, Cacucu. This skilled sauro-vet can rain Tonicshots on his foes while healing teammates, and summon a wind current that pulls in enemies to control the battlefield. While in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Ifa boosts Swirl and Electro-Charged DMG based on the party’s Nightsoul Points. With his sharp medical instincts, Ifa can also automatically heal the active character when their HP falls below a certain threshold, ensuring his team stays healthy and strong in the heat of battle.</p><p>In Version 5.6’s Event Wishes, Escoffier, Navia, and Ifa will be part of the first phase, followed by Kinich and Raiden Shogun in the latter. Meanwhile, this version will bring back the Chronicled Wish, this time featuring various 5-star characters from Inazuma.</p><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 5.6 will lead to another chapter of the main story, and let players run an amusement park starting from May 7. </p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

The metropolis of Tokyo is a bit different from what we know, but the streets are just as nostalgic, or, depending on where you’re from, they’re just as good as the place you’ve always wanted to visit.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Companions / Atypical Vehicles</strong></p><p>Autonomous drones, affectionately called “Companions,” have been integrated into daily life, but in cop terms, they’re referred to as “Atypical Vehicles”.</p><p>When they pose a significant threat to society, it’s time for the Atypical Vehicle Disposal Squad (AVDS)—a special unit of the Nitro City police force—to commence their mission to destroy all rogue vehicles!</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">Shoot ‘Em Up</a>!</strong></p><p>Good news: you can bring as much ammo as you want… and that includes grenades!</p><p>After just a little bit of cooldown, the lightning bolt of destruction will return to your hands. Ah, how wonderful! Just like magic!</p><p><strong>Gadgets and Gizmos</strong></p><p>Tired of traditional grenades? Why not try out the EMP, damage-dealing radio-controlled drones, auto-firing turrets, flamethrowers, anti-tank missiles, and more? There’s sure to be at least one out of the 12 different cool gadgets that’ll catch your eye.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Guns</strong></p><p>By assuming a more stable shooting position, your bullets will hit targets more accurately and deal more damage.</p><p>You can shoot some guns like SMGs while walking without caring about that, since they’re for close-range anyway, but the bigger the gun, the more it’s affected by your positioning. Stand still and aim carefully to use them properly.</p><p><strong>Large Armored Targets</strong></p><p>Oh no! We’re under attack by tanks and helicopters! Whatever can we do~?!</p><p>Rifles and SMGs don’t do much to armored targets. You could totally stick with them and show them your perseverance, but you could hit them harder where it hurts with more powerful firearms and gadgets.</p><p><strong>Radio Comms</strong></p><p>Story dialogue in stages are all contained in the police radio comms, which can be accessed at anytime and are completely optional. Which means you can ignore them completely if you want.</p><p>Great for multiple playthroughs, or for people who think the story sections of video games are basically the same as the instruction manual of an electric toothbrush.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Nitro Express（ナイトロ エクスプレス） - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRRS2CsrR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
