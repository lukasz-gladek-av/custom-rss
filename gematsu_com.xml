Already it seemed like a war with no end, but one fateful day, a jet-black dragon descended upon the kingdom, and in the blink of an eye, destroyed everything.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>While chaos reigned, it was soon discovered that the dragon was in fact a “chimera” created from a dragon with no interest in the humans’ war. The enemy country Fahftania had developed an unprecedented weapon, joining forces with the giant military force, Hellmuth Brigade, and sacrificing thousands of citizens to produce the greatest chimera in history. Having acquired this overwhelming power, no one possessed the ability to defeat Fahftania and the Hellmuth Brigade.</p><p>A scout from the Clausewitz Battalion discovered that Fahftania was creating chimeras in their aim to take over the world. Hearing this, Captain Vel Dina is appalled by their inhumane experiments and orders the Clausewitz Battalion to march on Fahftania and put a stop to them. However, they would soon find that all of Fahftania is under the Hellmuth Brigade thrall. This is where our story begins.</p><p>Additional content may be used right from the start of play.
