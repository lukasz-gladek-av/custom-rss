Rediscover its iconic locations and unforgettable characters through a stunning visual overhaul, redesigned gameplay, and the same captivating storytelling that made it a classic.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Kate Walker, a brilliant lawyer from New York, is sent to a remote village in the French Alps to finalize the sale of an old automaton factory. But what begins as a routine assignment soon turns into an extraordinary journey across Eastern Europe and its snow-covered landscapes.</p><p>Accompanied by Oscar, a loyal and one-of-a-kind automaton, Kate sets out to explore mysterious and forgotten places, filled with eccentric characters, as she follows the trail of Hans Voralberg, a genius inventor pursuing a seemingly impossible dream: finding the last living mammoths on the mythical island of Syberia.</p><p>An unexpected, thrilling, and deeply emotional voyage that will challenge everything she thought she knew. First released in 2002, <em>Syberia</em> became a reference in the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,507 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> genre, praised for its unique atmosphere, sharp writing, and the richness of Benoit Sokal’s artistic vision. This remaster is a new opportunity to (re)discover the masterpiece, following in the footsteps of other titles from Benoit Sokal such as <em><a title="Games > Syberia: The World Before [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/syberia-the-world-before">Syberia: The World Before</a></em> and the newly released <em><a title="Games > Amerzone: The Explorer's Legacy (2025) [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-2025">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a></em>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Faithful and Stunning Overhaul</strong> – Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D. Every environment has been carefully rebuilt with an art direction that stays true to Benoît Sokal’s unique style, offering an even deeper immersion into his singular visual universe.</li><li><strong>Reimagined Mechanical Puzzles</strong> – Enjoy a fresh take on the game’s intricate puzzles, redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience while preserving their essential role in uncovering the secrets behind Voralberg’s genius.</li><li><strong>A Modernized Gameplay <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Rediscover Kate Walker’s journey with an updated user interface, improved 3D navigation, and more fluid controls tailored to today’s standards, all without compromising the game’s contemplative and narrative soul.</li><li><strong>A Rich and Immersive World</strong> – From the alpine town of Valadilène to the frozen edges of Eastern Russia, Syberia transports you into a world of mystery, automatons, and poetic machinery. Dive into a clockpunk adventure where realism blends seamlessly with dreamlike wonder.</li><li><strong>A Moving and Unforgettable Story</strong> – Experience a deeply human narrative, as Kate Walker’s legal assignment turns into a profound journey of self-discovery. Filled with unexpected encounters, emotional choices, and moments of awe, Syberia’s tale blurs the line between strangeness and the sublime.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Before / After Comparison Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Syberia Remastered – ESRB Before/After" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMyKwVlDs_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/syberia-remastered-launches-november-6-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc-november-13-for-quest-3]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” will launch on September 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-987401"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>After thwarting the Exaltists’ conspiracy previously, the Defense Force dispatches the Obol Squad to join the conflict, introducing the new agents Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus. With trustworthy allies and various in-game events, Proxies will get to delve deeper into the power struggles in New Eridu and uncover the past of the familiar yet fresh faction, the Obol Squad.</p><p>The Defense Force’s intervention—spearheaded by Major General Lorenz and commanded by Colonel Isolde—throws Waifei Peninsula’s power struggles into even more turbulent waters. Beyond eliminating the Exaltists’ remnants, the Obol Squad will also uncover long-buried truths and reveal the hidden stories behind team member Seed’s mysterious past and inner world.</p><p>As a genius mechanic, the S-Rank Electric Attack Agent Seed has transformed the Seed Sr. mecha into a formidable partner with overwhelming firepower and suppression capabilities. Seed excels in synergizing with other Attack agents to enhance the team’s sustained damage output. Orphie &amp; Magus, the S-Rank Fire Attack Agent and Obol Squad’s captain, excels in coordinated team combat using powerful lasers. Through EX Special Attack that assists allies, Orphie can accumulate Bottled Heat, and place all squad members into the Zeroed In state upon hitting enemies, boosting Attack and allowing Aftershocks to ignore a portion of the enemy’s Defense. Joining the stellar lineup is Mercury, the outstanding S-Rank Bangboo who operates a tank as combat support on the battlefield. S-Rank Electric Stun Agent Trigger and S-Rank Fire Attack Agent Evelyn will return in Version 2.2. Additionally, Soldier 0 – Anby is currently undergoing intensive training, and Proxies can expect her to return even stronger with her activated potential in future versions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_987402"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As for events, the Bangboo tower defense event Band of Brave Bangboo will come with new maps, enemies, and mechanics, including bushes and Miasmic environment. Successfully clearing stages will reward Proxies with the A-Rank Excaliboo. This Bangboo will attempt to draw his holy sword before attacking—success results in powerful sword strikes, while failure leads to determined hammer attacks against opponents. For lighter entertainment, the Rhythm Rave event challenges Proxies to sync beats with classic tracks and earn abundant in-game rewards.</p><p>Continuous optimizations has also been implemented to further improve player experience. For example, Proxies can now choose between Belle or Wise before starting companion events such as Quality Time invites.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.2 special program below.
