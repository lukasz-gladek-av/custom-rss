        <p>Here is the story synopsis, via <a href="https://vndb.org/v23458" target="_blank">VNDB</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Ritsuki, his younger sister Runa and childhood friend Mayu attend a school that is popular for its drama activities, with many of its graduates going on to become famous actors and scenario writers. Shortly after the entrance ceremony, they were invited by their classmate Inori to join the drama club. Ritsuki was eager to aim for the school’s primaries for the national competition, but first year students were forbidden from participating in the contest. They wouldn’t accept the fact that they were excluded just because they didn’t have much experience. If only they were given the opportunity to demonstrate their acting abilities…</p><p>Rumour has it that there is a ghost that haunts the theater. It is said that it will grant any wish so long as it is related to drama.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Relentless enemies, extremely deadly and fun weapons, speed and precision above all else—if you love <em>Quake III Arena</em>, modern and classic <em>DOOM</em>, or Apogee’s legendary first-person shooters, you’ll feel right at home in Paradise.”</p><p>“As the guy who helped launch the <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,984 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> genre with <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <em>Max Payne</em>, and <em>Prey</em>, I haven’t been this excited about an [first-person shooter] since the golden era of Apogee / <a title="Companies > 3D Realms [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/saber-interactive/3d-realms">3D Realms</a>,” wrote Scott Miller, founder. “<em>Turbo Overkill</em> is a sandbox of fun and original gameplay ideas that come together like a night of melty hot pizza and your favorite cold, frothy brew. Playing this game made me a Turbo Lover all over again.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Turbo Overkill | Console Launch Trailer | Out Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1hIWKrIJKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
