      </p></div><div><p>Following the dissolution of <a title="Companies > Neon Doctrine [41 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/combined-effect/neon-doctrine">Neon Doctrine</a> <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/neon-doctrine-to-merge-into-raw-fury">in October 2025</a>, founders Vladislav Tsopljak and Iain Garner have announced the establishment of <a title="Companies > Goldpact Goblins" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/goldpact-goblins">Goldpact Goblins</a>, offering “community first” solutions tailored for studios seeking support in community <a title="Genres > Management [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, marketing, social media outreach, production, business development, focus testing, quality assurance, branding, and strategy. <span id="more-1023428"></span></p><p>“One of the reasons we decided on a tailored solutions approach is because the current revenue share and recoup models don’t work for all teams,” said Goldpact Goblins CEO Vladislav Tsopljak in a press release. “We’ve seen it happen many times, especially in Southeast Asia, China, and South America, where a developer finds success but isn’t the next big thing. However, due to industry-standard revenue splits, aggressive recoup models, and passive investors, the devs see income months later and are a sadly small slice of the pie, often that is enough to shut down a promising studio. We want to provide a sustainable model that helps the local industry grow and thrive and allows developers to keep their gold in their pockets after launch.”</p><p>Goldpact Goblins president Iain Garner added, “What we’ve learned is that the heart of almost every successful game is a thriving community and our unique strategies are designed to help studios build, understand, and support communities that survive and thrive long after the Goblins have left the building.”</p><p>Since forming on January 1, Goldpact Goblins has established partnerships with the following games and studios:</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3193310/Deadly_Rehearsal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Deadly Rehearsal</em></a> (Kaigan Games)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621930/Grim_Trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Grim Trials</em></a> (Glory Jam)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040930/Just_A_Shadow_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Just A Shadow Game</em></a> (IndieLab)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2445690/Lost_Castle_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lost Castle 2</em></a> (Hunter Studio)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3154150/SpookABoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Spook-A-Boo</em></a> (Wala Interactive)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TCG Card Shop Simulator</em></a> (OPNeon Games)</li></ul><p>While Goldpact Goblins’ capacity for full service projects is already filled, it remains available for short-term consultancy, and will be able to offer full support for new developer projects after July 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->
