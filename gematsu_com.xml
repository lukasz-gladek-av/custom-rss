            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Blood West</em> first launched in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 10, 2022, followed by a full release on December 5, 2023. “Dead Man’s Promise” was released on December 18, 2024.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Games > Weird West [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> legends meet eldritch horror in <em>Blood West</em>, an immersive stealth first-person shooter. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.</p><p><strong>Three Episodes Offering Over 20 Hours of Play</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Classic <a title="Genres > Stealth [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Blood West</em> is a stealth first-person shooter inspired by the genre classics such as the <em>Thief</em> series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> games, or—from the contemporary catalog—<em><a title="Games > Hunt: Showdown [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a></em>. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?</p><p><strong>Weird West Legends Meet Eldritch <a title="Genres > Horror [722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a></strong></p><p>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.</p><p><strong>Unusual Characters and Their <a title="Platforms > Quest [157 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>lines</strong></p><p>In <em>Blood West</em> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.</p><p><strong>Non-Linear Maps Full of Secrets to Find</strong></p><p>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning—it’s probably cursed.</p><p><strong>Brutal Combat Against a Varied Cast of Foes</strong></p><p>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <em>Blood West</em> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <em><a title="Games > POSTAL: Brain Damaged [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/postal-brain-damaged">POSTAL: Brain Damaged</a></em>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!</p><p><strong>Scavenging and Resource <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong></p><p>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that—once slotted—can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.</p><p><strong>Great Variety of Impactful Weapons</strong></p><p>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <em>Blood West</em> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines—a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.</p><p><strong>Perk and Skill-Based Character Progression</strong></p><p>The <a title="Genres > RPG [17,689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>-like perk-based progression system in <em>Blood West</em> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.</p><p>Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/blood-west-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-on-october-16]]></content:encoded>
