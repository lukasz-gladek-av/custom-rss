It fuses together classic movement shooters with a unique bouncing ball weapon.</p><p>Reality is breaking. Trapped in an anomaly, you are Diego, an employee of Rundy’s Burger, a fast-food chain at the end of the ‘90s. But something is wrong. The restaurant keeps shifting, twisting into increasingly distorted versions of itself. </p><p>Use your agility and mastery of movement to navigate the chaos and avoid relentless attacks from the customers, twisted by the shifting reality of the restaurant. Destroy them with your only weapon—a high-speed bouncing ball that gains more power the faster it moves. Punch it, control it and Turn every room into a deadly playground.</p><p>Progress through four chapters, each unlocking new powers to push your abilities even further. Every level features a ranking system based on speed and skill.</p><!-- AD: content -->
