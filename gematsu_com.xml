            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>An Odyssey Across the Stars</strong></p><p>You control a Meteor blazing through the vast cosmos, navigating treacherous celestial terrain to ensure your survival. Precision and quick reflexes are your greatest allies as you steer past dynamic hazards and colossal astral obstacles on the journey to each level’s end. Every stage presents a unique sub-objective that must be conquered to unlock the exit portal.</p><p>Each <em>Meteora</em> run is an opportunity to sharpen your skills, push your limits, and climb the ranks. Face the challenge, chase the high scores, and etch your name among the cosmic elite on the leaderboards.</p><p><strong>Speed, <a title="Genres > Strategy [258 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a>, <a title="Genres > Survival [431 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

Every second demands split-second strategy and decisions as you navigate explosive asteroids belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers that threaten to freeze your momentum.</p><p>But fear not, the universe does throw lifelines. Scattered throughout space are Energy Crystals to increase your mass, and Stardust to push your velocity to the limit. Do you hoard mass for durability or fuel for raw acceleration? The landscape shifts with every level, leaving you with only one choice – adapt; here, balance is everything.</p><p>But you are not alone on this path. The most unpredictable hazards in Meteora are the other meteors on your path, each with its own elemental composition and unique abilities. Every meteor that crosses your path presents an opportunity or a threat. Some are rivals, some are fuel for your journey, but all are obstacles in your pursuit for survival. Harnessing their energy is the only option you have.</p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter the Takedown</strong></p><p><video id="video-975718-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/SMXl3rQ.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/SMXl3rQ.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/SMXl3rQ.mp4</a></video></p><p>Combat in the <em>Meteora</em> cosmos is fast and ruthless. Executing takedowns on rival Meteors is a rush! Flawless takedowns grant you momentary invincibility, allowing you to tear through space unchallenged while also presenting a perfect tool for split-second decision-making thrills.</p><p>Not every meteor is hostile though. Some offer valuable resources. Some bolster your mass. Some restore your fuel. And volatile meteors summon unpredictable hazards.</p><p>From cascading obstacles to Astral Spirits that mimic organic life; Survival isn’t just about speed. It’s about understanding the chaos that you are a part of.</p><p><strong>Total Immersion in PlayStation VR2</strong></p><p><video id="video-975718-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/vfyZbta.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vfyZbta.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/vfyZbta.mp4</a></video></p><p>Feel the scale of space like never before. Meteora leverages PlayStation VR2’s features to deliver an unparalleled experience. With motion controls designed for the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, the game fully utilizes the haptic feedback and high-resolution display, making every collision, chase, and planetary impact feel intensely real.</p><p>In virtual reality, Meteors loom larger, black holes are more ominous, and every takedown feels like a moment of pure cosmic dominance.</p><p>When it comes to space racing and high-impact collisions, <em>Meteora</em> delivers an unparalleled sense of immersion, thanks to the advanced haptic technology of the PlayStation 5 DualSense and PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. Every collision, rumble, and crackle has been meticulously integrated into controller feedback, allowing players to feel the roughness of the cosmic terrain while visually floating through the vastness of space.</p><p><video id="video-975718-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/mzifkm2.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mzifkm2.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/mzifkm2.mp4</a></video></p><p>The meteor boost rumble, synced with adaptive triggers, gives a realistic sensation of controlling an untamed force of nature. As speed modes and power-ups shift, the triggers tighten and release, reflecting the intensity of acceleration and deceleration. The tactile experience extends to electrification and freezing effects, making these moments truly visceral.</p><p>One of our favorite sensations is tailgating enemy meteors. The faint yet distinct rumbles mimic the fiery heat of an opponent’s trail, adding a subtle but impactful layer of immersion that only the Sense controllers can achieve.</p><p>Beyond realism, we’ve designed the controls to feel intuitive and effortless, ensuring players exert minimal effort for maximum fun. Since no one truly knows what piloting a meteor feels like, we’ve abandoned traditional steering mechanics. Instead, we aimed for a fluid, organic movement system, making the experience as natural as possible because being a meteor should be instinctive, not complicated.</p><p>With haptics, adaptive triggers and 3D Audio integration, Meteora transforms space racing into an experience you can see, hear, and feel.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a> or Flat Screen: The Choice is Yours</strong></p><p><em>Meteora</em> is designed to provide a seamless experience, whether played in virtual reality or non-virtual reality. Players will receive the full <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> regardless of their preference. Whether in immersive virtual reality or traditional flat screen mode, <em>Meteora</em> delivers the full experience. With a comprehensive suite of accessibility features, <em>Meteora</em> ensures no player is left behind on this celestial thrill ride.</p><p><em>Meteora</em> is our homage to old school action arcade games and a different take on the action racing genre. We can’t wait to share this out of the world journey with you.</p><p>Gear up for this meteoric adventure that puts you right at the heart of the cosmos next year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/meteora-the-race-against-spacetime-launches-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Negotiations currently underway with several companies.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Pole To Win Holdings will sell off <a title="Companies > AQUAPLUS [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hike/aquaplus">AQUAPLUS</a>, a subsidiary of its media contents company <a title="Companies > HIKE [214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hike">HIKE</a>, to a company outside of its group, the holdings company <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3657/OtX6/lS55/Od7e.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-975710"></span></p><p>Negotiations are currently underway with several companies, but a decision has not yet been made. An announcement will be made as soon as the details have been finalized.</p><p>Here is the group’s reasoning for selling off AQUAPLUS:</p><blockquote><p>Our Group provides quality consulting, game debugging, software testing, environment-building and transition support, monitoring, customer support, anti-fraud measures, and BPR support in the process of planning, developing, releasing, operating, and improving the lifecycle of customers’ services and products. This business is divided into three operations: Domestic Solutions, Overseas Solutions, and Media Contents.</p><p>Media Contents business is a new business that follows the core businesses of Domestic Solutions and Overseas Solutions. Our group has acquired subsidiaries such as SARUGAKUCHO Inc. in March 2010, QBIST Inc. in January 2015, <a title="Companies > CREST [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crest">CREST</a> Inc. in November 2019, colorful Inc. in October 2020, Panda Graphics Inc. and Delfi Sound Inc. in August 2021, SANETTY Produce Co., Ltd. in November 2022, and AQUAPLUS Co., Ltd in December 2022. These well-known companies in the entertainment industry were integrated as HIKE Inc. (hereinafter referred to as HIKE) from February 2023, and ShiiTAKE DiGiTAL Ltd. was acquired as a subsidiary in January 2024.</p><p>AQUAPLUS is promoting to develop and sell games as a subsidiary of Media Contents’s core company, HIKE. The company’s remake version of <em><a title="Games > ToHeart (2025) [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/toheart-2025">ToHeart</a></em> (PC / Nintendo Switch), which is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025, has steadily increased its reservations. However, in line with the today’s announcement of “Notice of Changes (Transfer of Shares and Receivables) in Consolidated Subsidiaries (Specified Subsidiaries) and Occurrence of Extraordinary Profits and Extraordinary Losses,” in Media Contents business, including HIKE, in order to secure competitive positions in the growing industry and intensifying competition in the content industry, we recognize that we are in a business environment where we must continue to make more upfront investments than in the past, so we have resolved for a management buyout (MBO) by HIKE’s founder and current president and for the same reason, we have resolved to transfer shares outside of our group for AQUAPLUS.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>AQUAPLUS was previously a subsidiary of HIKE, but rather than considering a transfer including HIKE that promotes 360-degree entertainment services for both business-to-consumer and business-to-business with a focus on intellectual properties, it was determined that a wider range of counterparties could consider the transfer of shares as a stand-alone game developer, which in turn would increase the possibility of transferring shares to a counterparty with prospects for greater synergy with AQUAPLUS. Accordingly, the Company has decided to make AQUAPLUS a direct subsidiary of the Company and to consider transferring shares of the company on a stand-alone basis. With regard to the transfer of AQUAPLUS shares, we are currently in the process of negotiating with a number of companies, but in order to expand the company’s business in the future, we will proceed with the transfer of shares to counterparties with more synergies.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/pole-to-win-holdings-to-sell-off-aquaplus]]></content:encoded>
