Set in two eras—the decaying future and 1980s Poland—players are plunged into a world inspired by the real Krakow district—Nowa Huta, where survival means bending time itself. You play as a Traveler, an agent of the mysterious Collective, emerging from a dystopian future to dive back into time and extract people before they perish in the apocalypse. As you explore a world on the brink of annihilation, you’ll encounter grotesque enemies known as the Orphans.</p><p><strong>Don’t Let Them Merge</strong></p><p>The new gameplay trailer reveals intense survival moments inside the Orphans’ nest, offering a closer look at these terrifying creatures. Orphans are twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity’s darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior—exceptionally aggressive and relentless—turning every encounter into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent them from merging. As previously shown, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. If not, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Exploring the Twisted Realms of the New Dawn</strong></p><p>Additionally, the exciting new trailer reveals part of the story of a mysterious Predecessor—Traveler ND 3500—and their cryptic travel log. Players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the existing Polish district—Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,940 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this fall.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase</span></h2><p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW4EcsG_Deg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/cronos-the-new-dawn-sector-a-0-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
