With <em>Descenders Next</em>, this time around players will be taking to the slopes across multiple downhill sports. When Next launches in April, it’ll initially bring snowboarding and mountainboarding to the masses, before additional sports are added at a later date.</p><p>That’s not the only big change for <em>Descenders</em>, as we give more powder to the people. Up to 12 players can ride the same mountain slopes, or you can simply shred solo, keeping your sick tricks to yourself. The world is absolutely massive this time around, with huge biomes to explore, and secret parks to discover.</p><p>Hand-crafted parks and races are dotted around the world, with procedurally generated maps connecting everything together, making sure you are travelling off-piste, and not left piste off.</p><p>There’s even more control over your rider this time, with flips, barrel rolls and grinding all on the table. And when you feel like you’ve mastered one mountain, you can simply switch sports and take on a whole new challenge. We doubt you’ll be left feeling board silly.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Top it all off with an absolute banger of a soundtrack from electronic music gods Monstercat, tons of clothing, kits and boards to discover and deck yourself out in, and a raft of updates coming in the future, and it’s all downhill from here for your board-dom levels.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Descenders Next is launching April 9th on PC and Gamepass!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whbyoSXJaXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
