Traversing through the dreaded fog, you’ll engage in aggressive gun fights, outsmart enemies, sneak in the shadows, solve puzzles, work with unlikely allies, and travel with your trusty skateboard. </p><p><strong>Encounter Otherworldly Denizens</strong></p><p>The underworld is filled with many odd figures—some of which may not be on your side, but not necessarily against you. Along the way, no matter what events may unfold, never forget the pact you made which plunged you into this abyss. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Eclectic, Genre-Bending Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Silly Polly Beast</em> features a truly unique gameplay experience, blending fluid world exploration and puzzle solving with perspective-shifting battles. As you traverse the world, Polly’s powers will grow deadlier—and separately, so will her skateboarding skills! As the narrative deepens, you’ll come across an eclectic blend of top-down and side-scrolling shooter segments, survival horror segments, and even skateboarding. Master forbidden spells and find the only thing left that matters to you—Alice.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Silly Polly Beast ► Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxO69IGZMpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silly-polly-beast-launches-october-28]]></content:encoded>

As the illness takes hold of the survivors and turns them into crazed and <a title="Companies > EXTREME [71 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/extreme">EXTREME</a>LY dangerous mutated creatures, the worlds’ governments are running around like headless chickens.

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Play as Anyone</strong> – Even the lowliest survivor you find has the potential to lead his own squad, explore, make the wasteland safe, and shape their own destiny. It’s up to you to upgrade and specialize any survivor you find in the wasteland any way you see fit.</li><li><strong>Explore, Loot, and Capture</strong> – While most of the buildings of the Dust Bowl are long abandoned and taken over by the undead, the loot and potential shelter is coveted by most survivors. During your exploration missions you’ll come across various farmsteads, factories and military installations full to the brim with monsters, loot, and most importantly, foundations that hold the potential to turn the long abandoned structures into sprawling and heavily fortified settlements.</li><li><strong>Your Own Safe <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong> – With survivors from all over the wasteland pouring into your settlements for safety, it’s smart to keep them occupied. Assign them to build factories to make food, fabricate resources or make useful goods to barter with, put up and upgrade defenses, and in the event of an attack, task your best soldiers to protect your settlements while you’re away or join the battle yourself and help push back the monsters coming to take what’s yours!</li><li><strong>Scout Out Your Competition</strong> – The packs of monsters always have a leader. Plan ahead, strategically assemble your squad of specialists to maximize your odds of survival, and head out on exploration and scouting missions. Gather vital intelligence on the monsters’ movements to better defend your settlements, or find and eliminate the bosses to stop the attacks altogether.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Decision: Red Daze | OFFICIAL CONSOLES RELEASE TRAILER | Nordcurrent Labs" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8LVNblm0AwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/isometric-action-rpg-decision-red-daze-now-available-for-ps5-xbox-series]]></content:encoded>
