        <p><em>FARAWAY TRAIN</em> is an atmospheric narrative adventure game.</p><p>You wake up in an unfamiliar, old-fashioned train and are asked to trace the ephemeral life of Empress Roxelana, who led the world into collapse by using an ancient magical device called the “Nebula Astronomical Disc.” Search the train for clues to uncover the date and location where she used the device.</p><p>Along the way, there will be locked cabin doors that impede your progress. The date of each turning point in Roxelana’s life serves as the key to opening these doors. Find and enter the number representing these dates to unlock each door while unraveling more of the story behind the abandoned Empress and the magical device.</p><p>As you explore the train, the beautiful, vast scenery outside the train windows will continuously change with procedural generation.<br>Enjoy the unique scenery spreading out endlessly outside; you will never see the same landscape twice.</p><p>The game also offers a Free Mode where the player can freely walk around the train, sit in any seat, look out the train window, and read the ePUB file.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="FARAWAY TRAIN PlayStation™5&amp;Xbox Series X|S versions Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFdN1EhblFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『FARAWAY TRAIN 最涯(さいはて)の列車』PlayStation5版&amp;Xbox Series X|S版 トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xJWAWuQY10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/narrative-adventure-game-faraway-train-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-in-2025]]></content:encoded>
