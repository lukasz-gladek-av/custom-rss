    <p><span>PlayStation 5 Pro ray-tracing support, new playable Agents, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “A Storm of Falling Stars,” will launch on December 18, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-931725"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As falling stars pierce the night sky, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>‘s upcoming Version 1.4 will introduce an overhaul of Main Story stages, significant updates to Hollow Zero, the game’s debut on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Pro, and the highly anticipated Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa.</p><p>In this upcoming version, the TV mode in the Main Story will be replaced with more immersive combat and exploration. The highly anticipated Section 6 Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa, are coming soon, unveiling the culminating chapter of the year. The update will also introduce a major new combat gameplay mode, Hollow Zero: Shadows Lost, alongside the addition of new areas, Port Elpis and <a title="Games > Reverb" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reverb">Reverb</a> Arena. Proxies can obtain the S-Rank character Asaba Harumasa for free after the update.</p><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>‘s Version 1.4 features various optimizations to make combat and gameplay smoother than ever. Redesigned Main Story stages from the Prologue to Chapter 3 are now added to the HDD system. In future updates to the Main Story, the TV mode will also be replaced with story stages, allowing Proxies to dive directly into battles while commanding Eous to explore the Hollows. Additionally, all contracted Agents will be playable in the city, and a new Quality Time Mode lets Proxies stroll through New Eridu with their Agents. In combat, Decibels will no longer be shared across the squad, allowing all squad members to unleash their stunning Ultimates in a row for even more spectacular battle scenes. The update also adds a Quick Sweep feature for Shiyu Defense challenges, along with other optimizations to streamline progression and character upgrades.</p><p>In previous chapters, Proxies were drawn into a conspiracy surrounding Sacrifice after the demolition case orchestrated by Vision Corporation. In Chapter 5, with the awakening of our “old friend” Perlman, the hidden truths and the Wise and Belle’s backstories will be revealed. Meanwhile, New Eridu Public Security is undergoing a leadership election. As the truth comes to light and a new crisis emerges, Proxies will join forces with Section 6 to venture into the unknown Port Elpis, where all mysteries will be unveiled as the story reaches its finale.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Facing formidable enemies, Hoshimi Miyabi, the youngest Void Hunter, showcases her unmatched strength with her Ethereal-Slaying Katana – Tailless. As a Frost <a title="Games > Anomaly Agent [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/anomaly-agent">Anomaly Agent</a>, Miyabi can surround enemies with Icefire, causing Frost Anomaly and triggering special effects. With swift movements and precise slashes, she accumulates Fallen Frost to unleash a powerful forward attack, dealing devastating Frost damage before elegantly sheathing her blade. Beyond appreciating Miyabi’s graceful sword skill, Proxies can also uncover Harumasa’s hidden past in his special OVA. As an Electric Agent, Harumasa seamlessly switches between bow and blade, marks targets, and delivers unexpected strikes to enemies with active Electro Quivers. Proxies who reach Inter-Knot Lv. 8 can obtain Asaba Harumasa for free after Version 1.4 goes live.</p><p>Moreover, new combat gameplay modes are coming in Version 1.4, including Hollow Zero’s major update, Shadows Lost, and a new periodic operation, Deadly Assault. Proxies will face intense battles in the Lost Void with enhanced support and new equipment, such as Gear, Bangboo Assist skills, and Resonia. Additionally, the newly unlocked Reverb Arena will host a range of events to showcase its vibrant atmosphere, including a Bangboo-themed <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense game</a>play.</p><p>Apart from the release of Version 1.4 on PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,853 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, iOS, and Android, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> will officially launch on PlayStation 5 Pro on December 18, featuring enhanced performance and ray-tracing technology for an upgraded visual experience.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for PlayStation 5 via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, PC via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.4 trailer and special program below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/cladun-x3-details-editing-tools-network-features-and-more-classes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a title="Companies > Nippon Ichi Software [1,092 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nippon-ichi-software">Nippon Ichi Software</a> has released new information and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Cladun X3 [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cladun-x3">Cladun X3</a></em> introducing the game’s editing tools, network features, and three more character classes. <span id="more-931734"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Editing Tool: “Draw”</strong></p><p>In the <em>Cladun</em> series, players can create their characters using pixel art. You can begin “Drawing” at your base.</p><p><em>—You can turn on guide lines, so that you will not lose your place when drawing.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—You are not limited to human characters. It is possible to create characters of all types of shapes, including sushi or fish.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By making the feet like seaweed, you can make it look like your fish character is swimming.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_004.png"></a></figure><p>If you feel like it is too difficult to draw from scratch, you can choose from 90 types of existing characters to start, and then create your own based off of it.</p><p>It is possible to edit portions of a character, so let’s create a character with pigtails using an existing character as a base.</p><p><em>—We are going to edit this side-ponytail character to create a pigtailed character. You can choose from three skin colors and 10 hair colors.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Take the original hair, copy and paste, and adjust the position by flipping the pasted hair.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Now you have easily created a character with pigtails!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you are new to this “Draw” tool, try editing an existing character.</p><p>Not only can you create the front of your character, but you can also create facial expressions such as when your character takes damage. In addition, you can create walking or running animation, as well as attachments, such as weapons, armor, and wings.</p><p><em>—Customization isn’t limited to appearance. Your character’s name, description, dialogue, and even your standby motion can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editing Tool: “Music”</strong></p><p>In the <em>Cladun</em> series, players are also able to create their own background music and sound effects. It is a bit hard to use and could take some time to get used to, but do try this tool starting from this entry in the series.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>Compared to the last entry, <em>Cladun X3</em> allows for more expressions through more tones. New capabilities to set tone, envelopes, pink noise, and macro have been added, allowing for stronger expressions. In addition, you are allowed four times more characters compared to previous entries, which will let you create longer compositions.</p><p>To those who want to make music, but are intimidated by the process, we plan to release support tools on our official website.</p><p>Created music can be set as background music to the map of your created town, and can also be sent to other players through the “Network” tool.</p><p><em>—The available “Sample Music” can be used as background music as well. Background music of the Story Dungeon can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>By creating and setting background music that fits your created map, it creates better atmosphere to your town.</p><p><strong>■ Network Advanced Mode: Create Your Own Map and Share With Other Users</strong></p><p>In the “Advanced Mode” of “Network,” you can share maps, characters, and background music with other players.</p><p>In Advanced Mode, you can create your own Town Maps and then upload them for other players to see. You can also download maps that other players have created and explore.</p><p><strong>Town Map Creation Mode: Create Maps</strong></p><p>You can create a variety of maps, from maps that fit your created character, to maps that you yourself would like to explore.</p><p>Choose from a variety of chips located at the top of the screen, and place them anywhere on the map.</p><p><em>—There are many types of chips, and they can be chosen through the “Chips List” for use in map creation.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Chips can have either “Floor” or “Wall” properties. Characters can walk through “Floor” chips, while they cannot through “Wall” chips.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_015.jpg"></a></figure><p>By creatively using the prepared chip sets, you can easily create not only <a title="Genres > RPG [16,843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>-style towns, but also various other settings, such as modern school settings, bars, Japanese shrines, and even murder <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e scenes!</p><p><em>—A plethora of unique map chips are prepared for use, allowing you to create even suspenseful maps.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_017.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Several sample maps have also been provided as well. You can take these sample maps and edit them to create your own towns.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Chip Creation Mode: For Those Obsessed with Customization</strong></p><p>Chips can also be created through the “Draw” tool. Create your own chips, and build buildings and towns in your own distinct taste!</p><p><em>—You can combine multiple chips to create one build building. The possibilities are endless!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_020.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Drawing Placement Mode: Place Your Own Characters in Your Town</strong></p><p>Once you create your map, use the “Drawing Placement Mode” to place your created characters on the map! You can decide your characters’ dialogue, whether they walk or not, whether they open up shop when talked to, and many other settings.</p><p><em>—The behaviors of characters can be set in great detail—whether they walk or not, talk, open shop when interacted, provide maps after being talked to, and changing the music following interactions.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can actually purchase items through the shop.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_022.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_023.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Internet Upload: Share Your Map With Other Players</strong></p><p>If you’d like other people to play your maps and see your characters, try uploading your creations to the Internet! Other players of <em>Cladun X3</em> may come and pay your maps a visit.</p><p><em>—Using “Network” to upload your characters and maps makes it possible for other players to freely download your creations. Using “Specific Release Upload” will allow you to choose specific people to share your uploads to.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_024.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>World: Connect Your Towns to Create Gigantic Maps</strong></p><p>“World” is a large map created by connecting multiple Town Maps. A maximum of 900 Town Maps can be connected. Towns of the same atmosphere can be created to create a large city. Town Maps that have hidden “Magic Maps” can be strung together and explored at once. There are many ways to use and enjoy maps!</p><p><em>—Detailed information can be seen, such as if a map has cartographs and if they have characters placed in them. You can create a world by choosing only the maps that interest you.
