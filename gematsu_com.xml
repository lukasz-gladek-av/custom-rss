You have wandered into Oz, a faraway kingdom ruled by four witches and the king, after being caught up in a terrifying tornado. But you are not welcome. Sentenced to death upon arrival, you are ordered to investigate mysterious ruins along with four murderers on death row and a secretive supervisor of the condemned. Your only choice is to escape the death sentence and discover a way home. </p><p>In a dark reimagining of the classic tale, high school student Yuhiru is swept up in a mysterious tornado and finds herself lost in Oz. There, she is unjustly sentenced to death and ordered to travel with four convicts on death row and their supervisor. Their goal? Mysterious ruins that look like home, only dilapidated and infested with monsters. At the mercy of her fellow travelers, Yuhiru will face many hard decisions along the way. But there’s one thing she must bear in mind: No one is lost forever, no matter how far they’ve strayed.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
