    <p><span>"Development is progressing smoothly."</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The untitled third entry in the&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> project, following&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>, is currently about nine months into development, according to director Naoki Hamaguchi. <span id="more-940012"></span></p><p>“Regarding the third game, we started working on it immediately after finishing <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>—around March or April 2024—so we’ve already been in development for about nine months,” Hamaguchi told <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/865/G086563/20250121053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer.net</a> in an interview for the release of the <a title="Platforms > PC [22,181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. “Our goal for 2024 was to solidify the gameplay experience we were aiming for with the third entry of the <em>Remake</em> project, and we put together a great build that aligns with the team’s overall direction and vision.</p><p>“Starting in 2025, we’ve entered the phase of building and refining the game based on the plan we’ve established, and development is progressing smoothly and at a good pace, following the schedule I initially laid out. I can’t say when I’ll be able to share more information, but please stay tuned.”</p><p>Producer Yoshinori Kitase added, “When it comes to large, story-driven <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> projects, the pace of development depends heavily on whether the story itself is fully locked in. For the third game’s story, after I received the scenario from [scenario write Kazushige] Nojima, I asked him to give it a greater sense of completeness since this is the final game. We just wrapped that up a few days ago, so I feel that things are progressing smoothly.”</p><p>While <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> originally released on <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, sequel <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> released on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,694 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> without a PlayStation 4 version. Asked whether users can expect the third game to follow the trend of only being available on the next generation of consoles, Kitase laughed and said, “No, no, don’t worry about that next time.”</p><p>Earlier in the interview, 4Gamer.net asked Hamaguchi why the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> games have had staggered releases on PC, rather than launching day and date with their <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> versions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hamaguchi explained, “First off, the&nbsp;<em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [136 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> brand and franchise, and by extension, <a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, have built a very strong partnership with <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>. I strongly hope this continues going forward. However, it’s also true that we are no longer in an era where limiting the hardware on which you can play&nbsp; offers only substantial benefits. In fact, we’ve been seeing more and more cases where [Sony Interactive Entertainment]’s titles are being released for PC in addition to PlayStation 5.</p><p>“Through this&nbsp;<em>Remake</em> project, we also realized this shift, and have <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/square-enix-announces-new-medium-term-business-plan-square-enix-reboots-and-awakens-3-years-of-foundation-laying-for-long-term-growth">announced</a> as a company that we will be gearing towards multiplatform development. New [intellectual property] will be developed along these lines, so I personally believe it to be inevitable that console and PC versions will be released at the same time, or extremely close to each other, going forward.”</p><p>Later on in the interview, after Kitase’s comment about the third game not being exclusive to the next generation of consoles, Hamaguchi said,. “As I said earlier, going forward, [Square Enix] plans to release titles across a wide range of platforms so that more people can enjoy them. While I can’t make any promises at this point, we want our games to be played by as many people as possible, so we’ll do our best.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> first launched for PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. The PC version launched via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
