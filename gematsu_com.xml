      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bloober Team [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has released a new trailer for third-person <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [685 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Cronos: The New Dawn [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a></em> dubbed “A New Breed of Horror.” <span id="more-986296"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The trailer opens from a cat’s-eye view—an eerie, ground-level perspective that turns the familiar into something surreal. As if the trailer wasn’t enough, The Traveler made a dramatic appearance on stage in full cosplay—stepping out of the void and into the spotlight, blurring the line between the game and reality.</p><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person survival horror game developed by the renowned horror studio Bloober Team, best known for the critically acclaimed <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em> remake.</p><p>The game is built around a powerful, original narrative that unfolds in New Dawn – an abstract reinterpretation of the real Nowa Huta district in Kraków, Poland. The story is told across two contrasting timelines: a post-apocalyptic future and the gritty industrial reality of the 1980s. This unique setting blends retro realism with dystopian science-fiction and a retro futuristic atmosphere, creating a deeply immersive world filled with tension, mystery, and psychological depth.</p><p>At this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stunning new cinematic trailer premiered on the main stage—featuring a surprise appearance by none other than The Traveler.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer immerses us in the haunting ruins of New Dawn, beginning with a mysterious sequence that follows the movements of a cat through the desolate landscape. From there, it transitions into cinematic shots of The Traveler – the game’s central figure—whose journey we’ll follow throughout the game. We’re shown gripping, high-stakes encounters as The Traveler faces off against The Orphans—terrifying creatures that haunt this broken world. All of this plays out against the haunting soundtrack of “Sixteen Days / Gathering Dust” by This Mortal Coil, heightening the sense of mystery and atmosphere.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,725 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [334 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on September 5.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.
