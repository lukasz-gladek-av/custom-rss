People access a <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> space and spend their days clashing with a variety of feelings. You can take on various characters and convey your precious feelings by shooting a “photon sphere” at the heart of the person you want to convey them to!</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SPARK-PHOTON-BLAST-Ann_09-09-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SPARK-PHOTON-BLAST-Ann_09-09-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>A.D. XXXX, the world collapsed. A virus spread, people’s contact was severed, and the world became one where unexpressed feelings were locked away. However, a revolutionary technology to save the world is born…</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong></p><p>It’s a game created in a virtual reality space, surrounded by walls on all four sides. Players shoot spheres at each other, aiming to get their sphere into the opponent’s goal, which requires quick reflexes and strategy.</p><ul><li>Customize your character and sparkling effects.</li><li><a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r multiple storylines.</li><li>Unlock avatar items by clearing stories.</li></ul><p><strong>Emo Shoot System</strong></p><p>The greatest feature that makes “SPARK!” exciting is the “Emo Shoot System.” When you shoot a sphere into your opponent’s court, and they don’t touch it, the sphere reflects off the wall and comes back. Each time you chase and hit the returning sphere, it powers up. If you hit it three consecutive times, the sphere enters “SPARK!!” mode, and you can “break” the opponent player to aim for the now-empty goal!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="SPARK! -PHOTON BLAST- PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9Dv8HtMN2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/sports-action-game-spark-photon-blast-announced-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>
