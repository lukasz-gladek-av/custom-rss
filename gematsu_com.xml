Journalist Emma Sullivan and her cameraman Daniel Foster visit his apartment complex to film a report and speak with neighbors—but no one answers, despite strange noises inside.</p><p>As they enter, they discover the residents are already dead. In Amorth’s apartment, they uncover the truth: he died mid-ritual trying to save a possessed girl the Church had abandoned. He had hidden her in his attic for decades.</p><p>The girl—now a blind, monstrous entity—is accidentally freed. Emma disappears, and Daniel, armed only with his camera, must navigate the haunted building and uncover the truth before it’s too late.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
