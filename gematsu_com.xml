As Ro, you’ll face relentless spirits in grid-based, turn-driven battles that demand not only tactical precision but also the ability to adapt. To forge a path through despair and stand against formidable enemies and fearsome bosses, players must craft and refine their decks. Each realm visited offers unique deck types and mechanics, enriching and deepening the strategic layer. Players can further enhance their decks with shamanic totems, ensuring they are best prepared for the deadly encounters ahead.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In addition to the run-based gameplay, <em>Death Howl</em> inserts deck-building mechanics into an explorative open world, divided into grim biomes, like the Forest of Howling Shadows or Meadows of Delusion. Each region not only unlocks aforementioned new cards to craft, but also unveils fragments of Ro’s story, steeped in themes of love and loss, and uncovers the forgotten lore of this mysterious spiritual world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
