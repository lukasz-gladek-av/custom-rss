Crushed by a massive, unexplained debt, you’re forced into a job you never asked for: Chief Xeno Inspector.</p><p>Seems simple enough, just wave in the friendly aliens and turn away the dangerous ones. However, make the wrong call and Earth could be destroyed. No pressure though, right?</p><p><strong>The Year 2206</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Problems left unresolved in the 21st century have spiraled out of humanity’s control. Earth now seeks help from technologically advanced aliens to solve these crises. On the very day you awaken, diplomatic relations with other planets officially begin.</p><p>Aliens enter under many pretenses: tourism, studies, and more. But their claims are not always what they seem. As an Chief Xeno Inspector, you must see through their deception and uncover their true intentions.</p><p><strong>Chief Xeno Inspector’s Daily Routine</strong></p><p>Your work begins by checking the news. Then, you must interview the aliens and decide whether to grant or deny them entry. Fulfill your duties, repay your debt, and aim to one day set foot on Earth again yourself.</p><p>Whether Earth still exists by then… depends entirely on you.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027691"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>System Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Group-Based Screening</strong> – Examine a group of up to eight aliens. Analyze their collective information to spot patterns, inconsistencies, or red flags</li><li><strong>Simultaneous Interrogation</strong> – You can summon up to two aliens from the group into the interrogation room. Conversation between them may reveal hidden information.</li><li><strong>Conversation is Your Tool</strong> – There is no paperwork here. Listen carefully to what they say, who they suspect, and who they protect, to make your judgment.</li><li><strong>Chemistry Matters</strong> – Lovers, strangers, rival species… An applicant’s answers may change depending on who is next to them.</li><li><strong>A Story Shaped by Your Decisions</strong> – The future of Earth changes based on the results of your screenings.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dolphin</strong> – An android assigned to be your assistant, DOLPHIN provides operational briefings, but lacks the authority and manual to make final judgments. Instead, it supports your work in a friendly and familiar manner. The identity of the human model used for DOLPHIN’s design remains a mystery.</li><li><strong>Martian</strong> – Yes Martians actually exist. They lack any sense of social filters and are incapable of lying. Unfortunately, their brutal honesty often ends up hurting the feelings of other aliens…</li><li><strong>Pictor</strong> – Possessing technology far beyond Earth’s capabilities, Pictor are seen as potential saviors to the planet and its enduring challenges. Their knowledge is rumored to eclipse all others in the universe. When disaster strikes, placing your bet on them is rarely a mistake.</li><li><strong>Octo</strong> – An octopus-like alien with a distinctive manner of speech, Octo are highly intelligent and honest. Though they share a genetic connection with the Takoo, another cephalopod species from their home planet, the two are locked in a hostile relationship. Curiously, the Octo claim no knowledge of why they are being targeted.</li><li><strong>Other Aliens</strong> – You’ll meet an array of enigmatic aliens who defy human understanding and common sense. They come to Earth for various reasons: tourism, migration, asylum, <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e… or perhaps even in search of love!?</li><li><strong>???</strong> – This object is unable to be identified by Earth’s technology.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
