These updates will first be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,887 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,739 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,729 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,394 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, followed by <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,668 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> shortly afterwards. <span id="more-945056"></span></p><p>The updates include:</p><blockquote><p><strong>This Week</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Upgradeable Rangers</strong> – Digital Eclipse is implementing a new skill point system that lets you adjust your preferred Ranger’s strength, defense, and speed. This gives each character variety while also allowing every fan to make their favorite Rangers exactly play how they want them to play.</li><li><strong>Morphers</strong> – These special modifiers change up things like gravity, speed, and more. Plus, if you want to play Rita’s Rewind as it was at launch (with all Rangers being equally capable), that option is available, too. Mix and match for some seriously silly fun in your battles.</li><li><strong>Power Blast</strong> – Finding yourself swamped with Robo Rita’s many minions? Use Power Blast to knock them back in exchange for a chunk of your health bar. No reward without risk, but it’ll certainly help turn the tide of chaotic battles.</li><li><strong>Ground Recovery</strong> – With a properly timed button press, a hero who has been knocked back by an enemy attack can recover quickly and start attacking again, as opposed to landing on the ground and then needing to get up. This should keep the pace of those brawls at maximum speed!</li></ul><p><strong>This Spring</strong></p><p>Digital Eclipse is significantly expanding online multiplayer functionality. Previously, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em> supported three players on two separate consoles for a total of six online players. In this new update, six players will each be able to play on six separate machines using a peer-to-peer connection.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
