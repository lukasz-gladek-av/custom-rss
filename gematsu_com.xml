Determined, willful and stubborn, Dante has an incredibly strong sense of justice which occasionally brings out her prideful nature.</li><li><strong>Beatrice Portinari</strong> – Ardently dedicated to her purpose in overseeing Dante’s climb to Paradiso, her heart is set on securing her beloved’s salvation and keeping her from straying—whatever the cost. For Beatrice, one’s vows are eternal and her duty to protect and guide Dante prevails over any and every hardship.</li><li><strong>Virgil Pablias Vergilias Maro</strong> – Bubbly and full of energy, Virgil is endlessly devoted to her loved ones—an affectionate and kind soul despite her occasional bouts of mischievousness. A long term resident of Limbo, she’s immensely secretive about her past. With love conquers all as her motto, Virgil will go above and beyond to reach her goals even if it means going against the most powerful forces in Hell.</li><li><strong>Ovid Pablias Ovidias Naso</strong> – With the <a title="Platforms > Meta [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>morphoses as her magnum opus, Ovid resides in the Forum amongst her fellow Poets of Limbo. Demanding and outspoken, she spends her eternity antagonizing others while seeking the attention of her beloved, Virgil. While self-assured and confident, Ovid is terribly afraid of the dark and dislikes discussing the circumstances of her past life.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the trailer below.
