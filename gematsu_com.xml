The Early Access version is currently priced at $24.99.</p><p>“<em><a title="Companies > MUTAN [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mutan">Mutan</a>t League</em> is my bastard child that I’ve loved since its inception in the early nineties,” said <em>Mutant Football League 2</em> creative director Michael Mendheim in a press release. “And now, against all odds, our small team of passionate and dedicated developers has managed to resurrect it for a new generation. At its core, it’s fun, hard-hitting, and unpredictable—easy to pick up and play, yet layered with depth and strategy. We’re thrilled that on December 10, 2025, <em>Mutant Football League 2</em> will bring joy, laughter, and maybe a few bruises among friends to players worldwide.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Digital Dreams Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Mutant Football League 2</em> is the outrageous, over-the-top successor to the 2017 cult-classic created by Michael Mendheim, the mind behind <a title="Companies > Electronic Arts [1,782 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a>‘ ’90s <a title="Companies > SEGA [2,694 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">SEGA</a> Genesis hits <em>Mutant League Football</em> and <em>Mutant League Hockey</em>. His team is back in <a title="Genres > Action [3,043 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and hittin’ harder than Swift’s post-engagement half-time show.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This is not your parents’ football game or a bloated <a title="Genres > Simulation [834 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> that chases realism at the expense of fun. <em>Mutant Football League 2</em> is a brutal, darkly comedic eight-on-eight arcade-style action-packed football game. Teams of Mutated Super-Humans, Monstrous Orcs, Skeletal Deadheads, and Armored BruiserBots are pit against each other in fantastical arenas packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms. This “anti-Madden” blends the pick-up-and-play accessibility of arcade <a title="Genres > Sports [652 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports games</a> with strategic depth and a buttload of monstrous mayhem. Referees don’t just blow calls—they get blown up. Players don’t just fumble—they explode into limbs and pink mist.</p><p>In <em>Mutant Football League 2</em>, you’ll create your dream team of dirty dudes and customize your team’s player composition and tactics. The right team is your ticket to gridiron glory, and you’ll have to define their playing style. Will you deploy a relentless offensive by mutilating the opposition? Or will you slice through the enemy’s defense with razor-sharp, brainy maneuvers? It’s up to you to show the world your prowess and become a true MFL legend. Under your guidance, these mutants will rise from scrubs to legends, crushing the competition with style and savagery across <em>Mutant Football League 2</em>‘s single-player Season, Dynasty Supreme franchise mode, and online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bloody Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!</strong> – Brace yourself for exploding body parts, comically horrific deaths, and blood splatters that paint the field red. Whether getting blitzed by a rampaging monster or succumbing to a trap-laden end zone, every game is a symphony of unpredictable chaos. Dirty Trick plays even allow teams to commit bannable atrocities; those poor refs… Nothing and no one is safe.</li><li><strong>Monster Squad</strong> – Choose from over 36 MFL teams composed of maniacal mutant versions of pro football superstars—32 pro-league teams like the Karcass City Creeps, Killadelphia Evils, and Blitzburgh Steelheads, and 4 minor league teams like the Orcs of Hazards and Tokyo Terminators. MFL player cards also unlock historic players who can be signed in Free Agency; So, if you’d prefer to be a special snowflake, you can create an original team and craft a legacy of your own.</li><li><strong>Mutantmaxxing</strong> – Evolve your mutant baddies to unlock new armor sets, mutations, and weapons such as chainsaws, shotguns, and more. Hell, you can even use SkillRoid Boosts to give your players special abilities during a game. We ain’t natty out here.</li><li><strong>Dynasty Supreme</strong> – Become the ringleader of the freakshow in MFL2’s franchise mode. Start at the bottom of the league and claw to the top, turning pro by beating the competition across several seasons and winning Mayhem Bowls. Draft rookies every season and train them up to build a powerful roster.</li><li><strong>Doom Field Designer</strong> – Design your team’s arena, strategically placing lethal hazards and manipulating the weather—buzz saws to trim the competition, fire geysers to turn up the heat, or drop a blizzard on those fools. Make your stadium into the kind of place where only your team loves to play, and everyone else just prays to survive.</li><li><strong>The Voice of the MFL</strong> – Tim Kitzrow, the iconic voice of your favorite sports franchises—<em>NBA Jam</em>, <em>NFL Blitz</em>, <em>NHL Hitz</em>, and <em>MLB Slugfest</em>—commentates MFL 2, reciting plays and talking all kinds of smack.
