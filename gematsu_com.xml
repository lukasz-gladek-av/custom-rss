It will launch “as soon as possible,” with the team aiming for a December release. It will be a free upgrade for existing owners of <em>Factorio</em> on Switch. The <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [597 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of the expansion downloadable content “Space Age” will launch at the same time. <span id="more-1002419"></span></p><p><em>Factorio</em> is currently available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/factorio" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.factorio.com/buy" target="_blank">direct download</a>, as well as for Switch.</p><p>Here is an overview of the <em><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [22,975 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Switch 2 Edition</em>, via Wube Software:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em></strong></p><p>Similar to other games, we decided to release a <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, an upgrade you can get if you own the game for the original Switch. If you don’t have the game you can get it as part of a”bundle” which is the game with the <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> upgrade. Nintendo has some more information / clarification about <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions</em> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The upgraded version will feature:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen’s native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</li><li>Variable refresh rate support for the console’s screen.</li><li>Some higher quality animations.</li><li>Some higher resolution <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</li><li>Other visual improvements.</li><li>Faster loading times.</li><li>Ability to build much larger bases.</li><li>Mouse mode support. Using the Joy-Con Mouse Sensor, the left or right Joy-Con can be used as a mouse.</li></ul><p>The price for this upgrade will be… free. We don’t believe paying for a technical upgrade is reasonable. For players who want to support us, and want more content, they can get the “Space Age” expansion.</p><p><strong>Expansion Downloadable Content “Space Age”</strong></p><p>We are happy to announce that “Space Age” will be coming soon to the Switch 2, as a downloadable content priced at $35. It will feature the same content as the PC version—nothing was removed or trimmed down.</p><p>For full details on the “Space Age” expansion, check out the <a href="https://factorio.com/space-age/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Space Age” content page</a>.</p><p><strong>Release Date</strong></p><p>Both the <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> and the “Space Age” downloadable content for Switch 2 will release at the same time. The release date is… as soon as possible.</p><p>Like with the release for the original Nintendo Switch, the certification and store setup can take a long time. I don’t want to delay the release by setting a conservative release date, but I also don’t want to promise a release date that we might miss.</p><p>We are aiming for a December release, so you can get a nice gift before Christmas. Not an official release date, just something we are aiming for.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first footage of <em>Factorio – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> below, showcasing the game’s mouse mode.</p><h2><span>Switch 2 Mouse Mode Gameplay</span></h2><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-1002419-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4">https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-439-mouse-mode-demo.mp4</a></video></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/factorio-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>
