Not just a mystery adventure, this is a heart-warming tale of character growth.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After your father’s passing, you inherit the apartment he left behind.</p><p>Then one day, a mysterious man appears with a warning for you—the new landlord:</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>From that moment on, your journey to uncover the cleverly disguised Yokai begins.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>A social deduction adventure where monsters wear human faces.</p><p>This is a social deduction adventure game where you, as the landlord, must uncover Yokai who are blending in among your apartment’s tenants by gathering clues and presenting evidence.</p><p>The game is a single narrative divided into multiple chapters. As you progress, the seasons change, and new tenants—including more Yokai—move in to replace those who were evicted.</p><p>In each chapter, you’ll need to identify the Yokai in disguise, gather convincing evidence, and evict them.</p><p>The overarching goal of the game is to uncover why Yokai are infiltrating your apartment—and what motives lie behind the warnings of the mysterious man who appeared before you.</p><p><strong>Gather Information From Tenants</strong></p><p>Talk to your tenants—they’ll come to you, the new landlord, with complaints, requests, or simply to chat.</p><p>These conversations may contain clues that help you identify the Yokai among them. If something sounds off or strange, that might be a hint. Be sure to take notes.</p><p>Use the apartment’s security cameras (Available from Chapter Two)</p><p>Yokai are clever. Even with surveillance cameras, they won’t reveal themselves easily.</p><p>But if you’re observant, you might catch them doing something not quite human—when they think no one’s watching.</p><p>Even behavior that seems ordinary at first might hold hidden meaning. Keep your eyes open and leave no clue unexplored.</p><p><strong>Evict the Yokai Once Discovered</strong></p><p>After gathering enough evidence and identifying a tenant as a Yokai, you can proceed with their eviction.</p><p>However, simply pointing out the suspicious tenant won’t be enough to make them leave.</p><p>You must present evidence—such as proof that the other tenants are human—to convince the Yokai to reveal their true identity.</p><p>Be cautious: if you wrongly evict a human tenant, the remaining residents will become even more suspicious of one another—exactly what the yokai want.</p><p>Interview tenants carefully, uncover subtle “suspicious,” and connect the dots to build your case.</p><p>When you finally corner a yokai after rounds of deduction, you’ll experience a unique sense of accomplishment that only this game can deliver.</p><p><strong>If You Don’t Evict Them in Time…</strong></p><p>On the night of the new <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>, the Yokai will unleash their true power.</p><p>When that happens, there’s nothing us powerless humans can do.</p><p><strong>Estimated Total Playtime</strong></p><p>About 10 hours.</p><p>If you’re new to “mystery games,” it may take longer.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/yokai-landlord-monster-mystery-for-switch-launches-december-25]]></content:encoded>
