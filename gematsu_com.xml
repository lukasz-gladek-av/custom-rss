Joined by an endearing cast of allies, Mirage embarks on a perilous quest to embrace her true power and unveil the darkest secrets of the land. </p><p><em>Mirage: Miracle Quest</em> modernizes the classic turn-based RPG combat with deckbuilding mechanics, letting players customize their playstyle, create powerful synergies, and approach each battle with fresh strategy. </p><p>Players will confront formidable foes and guide tormented spirits to peace, as they explore a world brimming with challenges and wonders. On the way they will build relationships with their allies, and forge their path to becoming a true exorcist, as they fight the dark forces threatening to take over the world!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
