    <p><span>Due out in Early Access on September 3.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Streumon Studio [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/streumon-studio">Streumon Studio</a> has announced “daimonic first-person slasher” <em><a title="Games > Daimon Blades" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daimon-blades">Daimon Blades</a></em>, a new game set in the universe of <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869500/DAIMON_BLADES" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 3. <span id="more-984646"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Streumon Studio:</p><blockquote><p><em>Daimon Blades</em> is a daimonic first-person slasher where steel meets sin. Lead the scorched legions spawned from the abyssal entropy to their final reckoning alone or with a steel-clad group of four as you take up arms as a member of the Secreta, a shadowy cult of warrior monks sworn to contain the rising tide of daimonic incursions. <em>Daimon Blades</em> is set in the universe of Streumon’s breakout <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>.</p><p>To survive the cursed expeditions of the Daimon Realms, players must loot, craft, and evolve their daimon-slaying champions into true hellborn executioners in this RPG-infused first-person slasher. Along the way, they’ll face a relentless and ever-mutating bestiary of twisted Daimons bred in the wombs of chaos, each wielding distinct tactics that demand constant vigilance and adaptability. Wield your weapon of destruction, be it a flame-spewing sword, a bloodstained battle axe or a hammer that pulverizes bone to dust, and carve your name into the shifting dimensions as thunderous metal anthems drive your rampage.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_984655"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Dark, visceral worlds are nothing new to Streumon. After emerging from the modding scene of the early 2000s, the team launched its first commercial title, <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>, a million-selling cyberpunk <a title="Genres > RPG [17,524 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,221 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> that quickly earned a cult following. The studio went on to spill blood across the grimdark universe of <em><a title="Series > Warhammer [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/warhammer">Warhammer</a> 40,000</em>, developing <em>Space Hulk: Deathwing</em> and <em>Necromunda: Hired Gun</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, Streumon returns to its independent roots as developer and publisher of <em>Daimon Blades</em>, following a strategic move to reacquire full ownership of the studio in an era dominated by acquisitions and mergers. This renewed independence reflects the team’s deep commitment to creative control and quality. With Daimon Blades, Streumon is forging a bold new cooperative slasher, shaped by experience and driven by uncompromised vision.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p><em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?</p><p><strong>“What if?” Scenarios</strong></p><p>Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently? If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?</p><p>Wonder no more: <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> allows players to take control and shape the journey of the U.S.S. Voyager as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s! The game features <a title="Genres > Roguelike [355 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.</p><p><strong>Deep Ship <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Research</strong></p><p>After being moved forcefully into the Delta Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager ends up heavily damaged and in dire need of repairs as well as internal reconstruction. Restore destroyed rooms, secure life support and energy supplies, and start constructing. Ship systems, crew quarters, industrial and research facilities: You must decide what to build and when, to ensure the ship has what it needs for the perilous journey.</p><p>Expedite research into different fields. New technologies and improved layouts will not only strengthen the ship but also boost your crew’s morale. Exotic and dangerous research, like the technology of the Borg, is also within your reach. As captain, will you embrace it for the potential it offers, or will you omit it for the dangers it presents?</p><p><strong>Exploration and Resource Acquisition</strong></p><p>The dangers and opportunities of the Delta Quadrant beckon to be discovered by you and your crew. Scan celestial bodies to locate precious resources that fuel your journey. Find points of interest and oddities along your way, but beware: While the Delta Quadrant may reward the bold, it punishes the careless just as quickly. As captain, you have the final say in plotting a course and defining an approach.</p><p><strong>Ship Combat and Away Missions</strong></p><p>The journey of the U.S.S. Voyager would not be possible without both combat between ships and away missions to planets or space facilities.</p><p>For away missions, put together a team based on the individual talents of your crew. A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots. Minimize the risk for the team’s members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach—you decide.</p><p>When diplomacy fails, the U.S.S. Voyager and its crew are ready to enter ship combat at your command. From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry. And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>“What if?” Scenario and Storytelling</strong> – The ultimate platform to play out your course of action during the iconic journey of the U.S.S. Voyager.</li><li><strong>Complex Ship Management</strong> – Repair, construct, and maintain an efficient and habitable ship to ensure systems and crew operate effectively.</li><li><strong>Exploration and Decision Making</strong> – The Delta Quadrant is a fascinating yet perilous place that awaits exploration and demands decisive action.</li><li><strong>Combat and Away Missions</strong> – Use the talents of your crew smartly to minimize risk during away missions as well as strike boldly during ship combat encounters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p><em>Project Bloomwalker</em> is an all-new cozy crafting adventure game.</p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting a vision of a world where the protagonist’s footsteps bring life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal that transforms the world around them. Aboard their moving house, players and their adorable spirt companions called Oddling embark on a journey to explore uncharted territories, cleanse tainted landscapes, gather resources for crafting and decoration, and forge bonds with their Oddling friends as they prepare for new adventures.</p><p>Set in a once-beautiful land shared by humans and mysterious spirits, the game begins when a mysterious meteor crashes down that leaves an impact site so polluted that no life can survive. As the world suffers, Bloomwalkers appear who can wield power to restore life and heal the wounded earth. Taking on the role of a Bloomwalker, players will journey forth in their unique moving house to cleanse the polluted landscapes and rekindle the harmony of nature.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The difference between <em>Project Bloomwalker</em> and other <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting games</a> is its moving house system. Instead of being tied down due to a misplaced base, players experience true nomadic freedom with their own mobile house. They can effortlessly relocate, uncover breathtaking landscapes and transform any location into their personal sanctuary that embraces the joy of a life on the move.</p><p><strong>■ Game Overview</strong></p><p><strong>How would you describe <em>Bloomwalker</em> in one sentence?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> is a cozy interactive experience that lets players embark on a cozy crafting journey aboard a traveling house while befriending Oddlings, cleansing a tainted land and creating their perfect sanctuary.</p><p><strong>What is the core concept, and what kind of experience can players expect?</strong></p><p>We aim to evoke the joy of healing and restoration in <em>Bloomwalker</em>. This isn’t a game of combat, but of caring and reviving a world in need. Players will purify a wounded land and build a family amidst solitude, experiencing heartfelt connections and emotional resonance throughout this moving journey.</p><p><strong>What does the title <em>Bloomwalker</em> mean?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting our vision of a world where your mobile house brings life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal, transforming the world around them.</p><p><strong>You describe the game as “emotional crafting”-how does that differ from traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> crafting games?</strong></p><p>While traditional crafting games often revolve around survival, <em>Bloomwalker</em> offers a different experience, emphasizing “us and the world” through emotional crafting. Instead of the constant struggle to survive, we provide the joy of creating beauty, healing nature, and building meaningful relationships. With its rich themes of environment and emotion, we hope to invite more players to experience the unique and rewarding essence of the crafting genre.</p><p><strong>■ Gameplay and Systems</strong></p><p><strong>What do players primarily do in the game?</strong></p><p>There are four core activities in <em>Bloomwalker</em>:</p><ul><li>Explore unknown lands aboard your moving house.</li><li>Purify polluted nature.</li><li>Craft and decorate using gathered resources.</li><li>Connect with the Oddlings as you prepare for your next journey.</li></ul><p>You’ll also face challenges, including mysterious threats like the “Pelicanny.”</p><p>The game will support <a title="Genres > Co-Op [316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, so players can explore and decorate their traveling home with friends.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to make the house move?</strong></p><p>We encourage players to explore freely, without the fear of making mistakes. Unlike many crafting games where the base location is a stressful choice, we’ve removed that burden. Your house is a nomadic companion, allowing you to pack up and move to any landscape, transforming it into your next camp and home.</p><p><strong>I wanted to control the house myself, but I couldn’t. Is it not controllable? Can I customize or upgrade it? What’s the “Magic Door”?</strong></p><p>Yes! Full movement control is a key feature of the full game. The demo’s automated path was simply for showcasing the core appeal in a short time. And yes, you can unleash your creativity and decorate your house as you wish. We use a ‘Magic Door’ system to expand the interior space without changing the exterior, allowing you to design your own limitless and unique worlds.</p><p><strong>The Oddlings are adorable. Who are they?</strong></p><p>Oddlings are fairy-like companions you meet in the polluted world and, in turn, are your chosen family. We hope their presence brings the warmth of a “big, bustling family,” sharing daily life together. You’ll wake up, cook, play, and tuck each other in at night which is the kind of heartwarming routine that brings a smile to your face, and it’s all part of the game.</p><p><strong>The black cat inside the house was memorable. Who is it?</strong></p><p>Drawing inspiration from beloved fairy tales like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the cat is a mysterious character who lives in the moving house and joins you on your quest to purify the world. It holds a secret… but we wouldn’t want to reveal too much! :)</p><p><strong>The missions seemed quite structured—does that mean the game has low freedom for a crafting game?</strong></p><p>The demo was designed to be a guided tour, highlighting the core features in a limited timeframe. In the full version, you’ll be able to explore freely, choosing your own objectives, solving environmental puzzles, and discovering hidden materials and secrets throughout the world.</p><p><strong>■ Art, Story, and Atmosphere</strong></p><p><strong>The art style is stunning. What inspired this direction?</strong></p><p>Our vision was to immerse players in a living, breathing world reminiscent of a stunning animated film. The art team’s primary focus was to ensure every visual element felt alive, employing gentle yet vibrant color contrasts to emphasize the powerful transition from decay to flourishing life.</p><p><strong>What’s the overall story and worldbuilding like?</strong></p><p>Humans and spirits once shared a flourishing world, until a meteor brought ruin. The impact zone became a source of corruption, spreading decay across the land. In response, individuals called the Bloomwalkers with the ability to heal the environment began to emerge. Their presence brings life back to blighted areas. Players will take on the role of a Bloomwalker, traveling the land in their Moving House of Restoration, seeking to undo the damage.</p><p><strong>■ Development History</strong></p><p><strong>What games inspired <em>Bloomwalker</em>?</strong></p><p>The crafting genre is filled with excellent games that have captivated players and sparked creativity. <em>Bloomwalker</em>, however, seeks to redefine the experience by introducing elements of heartfelt warmth, animation-inspired emotion, and a profound sense of harmony with the natural world. Instead of drawing inspiration from particular games, we chose to build upon the genre’s foundations while injecting our own unique emotional narrative.</p><p><strong>Why choose the environment as a central theme?</strong></p><p>Our philosophy is that games have the power to offer a warm and reflective perspective on life. <em>Bloomwalker</em> isn’t about delivering a complex message; instead, we aspire to evoke a subtle emotion in each player: the urge to protect the beauty that surrounds them. Our hope is that the game can encourage players to embrace a more positive outlook on the world.</p><p><strong>■ Other Details</strong></p><p><strong>When will the game be released, and on what platforms?</strong></p><p>We will share more details on the launch schedule through various channels.</p><p>It may take a while, but we believe it’s the time needed to fully realize the living, breathing world we envision.</p><p>The game made its debut at Gamescom, and we’re committed to making it a lasting, memorable experience.</p><p>Platforms? We’re preparing a broad launch. You’ll find <em>Bloomwalker</em> on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,484 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, including Game Pass, and various platforms across console and PC.</p><p><strong>Why did you debut at Gamescom? Are you targeting the European market?</strong></p><p>Gamescom brings together some of the most passionate gamers in the world, making it the perfect place to share our new journey. We also believe that European players—many of whom deeply value environmental themes—will resonate strongly with our message of restoration and renewal.</p><p><strong>What about language support?</strong></p><p>The demo is currently in English, but the full game will support a wide range of languages, which is in line with what’s standard for console releases.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/netmarble-announces-cozy-crafting-adventure-game-project-bloomwalker-for-xbox-series-pc-and-more]]></content:encoded>
