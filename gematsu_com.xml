            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Both the Switch 2 and Switch versions will be available physically. The Switch 2 version will ship on a game-key card.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>This is an escape <a title="Genres > Action [3,007 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> that follows the rules of the popular Fuji TV show <em>Run for Money</em>, in which players become Runners and win prize money based on the time spent escaping the Hunters let loose in an enclosed area.</p><p>This game is the first in the series to include a “Hunter Mode” in which the player can aim to become the greatest Hunter. It also supports online play, so players can play against users across the country and compete in the online leaderboards.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Realistic Escape Action Just Like the TV Show</strong></p><p>The game flow is as follows: Runners get a head start to escape, and Hunters are released 30 seconds later. Runners accumulate prize money based on the amount of time they spend escaping, and can of course surrender at any point to keep the prize money accumulated thus far. If the Runners can avoid being captured by a Hunter within the 15-minute time limit, they have successfully escaped. But if a Runner is captured by a Hunter, it is “Game Over!” Can you escape the Hunters until the very end?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Become the Hunter in Hunter Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunter Mode,” which puts players in control of a Hunter, is included for the first time in the series. Players have always dreamed of becoming a Hunter and chasing down and capturing Runners, and now it is finally possible. Become a Hunter, capture Runners, and aim to be the greatest Hunter. Updated Hunters will also appear.</p><p><strong>A Series First: Hunters vs. Runners Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” in which players can choose to play as either a Hunter or Runner, is included for the first time in the series. In order to stop the rampaging Hunters, who have lost control of their power, the Runners must launch a counterattack against the Hunters using weapons obtained in missions. In “Online VS,” up to 12 users can play together (four Hunters, eight Runners). Who will come out on top between the Hyper Hunters Army and the Runners?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Online VS</strong></p><p>Includes an “Online VS” feature that allows up to 12 players to compete for the first time in the series. Users can compete online via quick and simple matchmaking, or play against friends. All five “Runners Mode” and “Hunters vs. Runners Mode” stages can be played online.</p><p><strong>Compete Against Players Across the Country in the Online Leaderboards</strong></p><p>In “Hunter Mode,” your ranking is determined by your score based on how fast you clear the stage. In “Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” your ranking is determined by the total prize money accumulated playing both offline and online.</p><p><strong>High-Variety Game-Original Stages</strong></p><p>The battle stages are all original! There are a total of five stages: “Wonderland,” “Diversity,” “Fantasy,” “The Airport,” and “The Pier.” The events that occur in each stage will trigger various missions, and by completing those missions, your escape may be made easier through things like the escape area expanding or obstructing the release of Hunters.</p><p><strong>Series Mainstays Return</strong></p><p>Popular elements from the series will of course return, including “GameShare” and “Local Communication Play” with up to four players, “Hard Mode” featuring “Hyper Hunters” with enhanced performance, and “Trophy” and “Hunter Figure” collecting.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/run-for-money-hunters-vs-runners-can-you-win-as-either-adds-switch-2-version-launches-december-4-in-japan]]></content:encoded>
