For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p><p>Producer Rosie Ball added, “Embracing a four-day work week and a firm no-crunch policy has been a huge part of realizing our approach to game development – that the team feels valued, rested and supported. We know creativity flourishes in a healthy work environment, and we’re confident that the mindful and deliberate pace of <em>Witchbrook</em> delivers this experience to the players.”</p><p>Art director Steph Caskenette said, “<em>Witchbrook</em> is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us. Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Chucklefish:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
