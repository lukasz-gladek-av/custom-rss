Re: Dive</em>; and was appointed executive director in April 2019.</p><p>“Since Cygames’ inception, Mr. Kimura has been instrumental in driving and shaping the company’s growth with his significant contributions,” Cygames said in the announcement. “We respect his decision and are profoundly grateful for his achievements throughout his tenure at Cygames.”</p><p>Kimura’s responsibilities have been allocated among the current board members, and a comprehensive road map has been established to ensure the seamless continuation of future business operations.</p><p>In a message posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/KimuraYuito/status/1972912672619516331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, Kimura said that ongoing, but non-life-threatening, health issues have made it difficult to carry out his duties, leading to his decision to step down as executive director and producer. He noted that the titles he previously oversaw have already been passed on to trusted colleagues, and expressed hope that with proper rest he can make a full recovery and return to game production in the future.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cygames-executive-director-yuito-kimura-steps-down]]></content:encoded>
