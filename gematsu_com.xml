    <p><span>First new entry in the Tomodachi Life series in more than 10 years.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></em>, the first new entry in the <em>Tomodachi Life</em> series in more than 10 years, will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on April 16, <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [23,491 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260129403327/en/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1021708"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><p>In the <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> game, players can create Mii characters based on family, friends and anyone they can imagine, and have them inhabit a vibrant, eclectic island where almost anything can happen. Customize Mii characters right down to their personalities, little quirks and living spaces, then see what weird and wonderful things they’ll get up to. Give them an occasional nudge to divulge what’s on their minds, help them solve life’s problems, cultivate their friendships and more. In this game, time passes the same way as the real world, so try and drop in on your Mii characters daily as they continue to live their best island lives!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022377"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>See below for more detailed information on the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Mii Characters With Character</strong> – In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, players can fully customize and envision Mii characters as family, friends and more. Your experience can differ based on the Miis you create as residents, so feel free to experiment and grow your island population!</li><li><strong>Create Many Miis</strong> – There are two ways to create Mii characters: Choose “Get Help” to answer questions about their facial features, or “From Scratch” to select from various face types, hairstyles, eyes and more. There are many parts to choose from, some of which are new to this game, and you can create even more imaginative looking Miis with robust face paint options, too. After that, you can customize their name, height, body type, gender, voice and aspects of their personality, including how quirky they are, their energy levels and more.</li><li><strong>Help Residents Connect</strong> – Once created, Miis will need some help getting on their feet. One way to do this is to bring various residents together. Drop Miis near each other and different situations might play out: They may discuss their favorite foods or bond over their love of monster trucks. Once acquainted, the Miis will be able to interact on their own. You can also have up to eight residents live together as roommates, and they’ll react differently when sharing a home. With multiple Miis under one roof, some unexpected dramas may unfold!</li><li><strong>Visit Island Shops and Facilities</strong> – Help Miis discover their favorite eats and culinary curiosities at Fresh Kingdom food mart; pick up a range of everyday attire and out-there outfits at Where &amp; Wear clothing; revamp rooms and living spaces at T&amp;C Reno home supply (there are even rooms for Miis who dream of sleeping in a supermarket or a library!); shop for reasonably priced items that change depending on the time of day at the Marketplace; gather island decorations at Quik Build amenities; tune into the MNN news station to keep up with the Miis and everyday happenings on the island; and stage a fun photo op for Miis at Foto-Tomo photography and more.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Palette [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/palette">Palette</a> House Workshop</strong> – Create a wide range of elements at this artsy workshop to further enliven island life! Design pets for Mii characters, draft up custom drinks, sketch a resident’s favorite TV show, decorate a special item of clothing, draw the exterior of a house and ground tiles, and go wild by creating original items for your island, too.</li><li><strong>Make Your Island Yours</strong> – Change up your island’s aesthetic with landscape items, such as trees, plants, benches, vending machines, bouncy playground rides and more. Move shops and houses around, expand areas of land, and more based on suggestions from residents or personal preference.</li><li><strong>More Ways to Customize</strong> – And add some flourishes to Mii characters by gifting them little quirks that can give them even more individuality, like poses they may strike, how they enjoy their food or having them toss and turn while they sleep, for example. You can also gift them favorite phrases to spice up their sentences. Try finding little quirks that fit each Mii!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

The returning cards were created by a generative AI model called “AI KANEKO,” that would generate new art trained on works from Kazuma Kaneko based on player <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s and decisions within the original game. <em>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</em> for the <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> is an offline title and does not utilize generative AI to create new cards.</p><p>“As generative AI emerged, I had a desire as an artist to create something with this new technology in a similar way when digital art evolved from pen and paper,” said Kazuma Kaneko in a press release. “As this desire took shape we created and released <em>Tsukuyomi: the Divine Hunter</em> which featured an AI trained on my art where players could create unique cards by playing the game. Through the AI, it felt as if I could connect with everyone around the world and wondered if we could use these cards to create something new. The result is <em>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</em>, a special game born from the connection between you all and myself through AI.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via COLOPL:</p><!-- AD: content -->

    <p><span>Kickstarter campaign coming soon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Moon Beast Productions" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-beast-productions">Moon Beast Productions</a>, a studio founded by <em>Diablo</em> veterans Philip Shenk, Peter Hu, and Erich Schaefer, has announced <em><a title="Games > Darkhaven" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a></em>, a dark fantasy isometric <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,983 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> that “returns to the genre’s roots while pushing it forward with a fully dynamic, persistent world.” It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced, but it will launch first in Early Access. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> is coming soon. <span id="more-1021761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Moon Beast Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Darkhaven</em> is a dark fantasy isometric action RPG set in the aftermath of a great and final collapse of civilization. <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> empires have fallen, their ruins reclaimed by wilderness, monsters, and predatory supernatural forces. Players are heirs to a legacy of power that is the last hope for this dying world. As eldritch evil worms its way into the world to feed on its remains, it falls to these few to bring the land back from the brink of death.</p><p>Designed for solo play, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,839 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s, and high-stakes player-versus-player-enabled realms, <em>Darkhaven</em> is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world. Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.</p><p>Combat in <em>Darkhaven</em> enhances the balance between stat progression, build choice, and player skill. Heroes can jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> is not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness, dramatically expanding the “action” at the heart of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,946 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a>.</p><p>The game’s itemization and progression philosophy draws heavily on the originators of the action RPG genre, Diablo and Diablo II. Rejecting the incrementalism common in many modern titles, <em>Darkhaven</em> embraces bold, expressive loot—items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021759"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,” said Moon Beast Productions co-founder and chief creative officer Erich Schaefer in a press release. “Movement is fun. Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an action RPG.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and president Peter Hu added, “Great itemization is about possibility. In <em>Darkhaven</em>, we want items that open doors, gear that makes you stop and rethink your build, your strategy, or even how you play the game. Finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and CEO Philip Shenk said, “We’re incredibly excited to finally reveal <em>Darkhaven</em> and open its Steam page. This project represents everything we’ve learned about ARPGs over the last two decades, and what becomes possible when those ideas are combined with modern technology. We’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create. With the community’s support, we’re ready to bring <em>Darkhaven</em> to Early Access, which will allow us to continue to build the game into the incredible experience we all want it to be.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
