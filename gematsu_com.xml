The <em>King of Meat</em>: Deluxe Edition also includes the Tapeboard Betsy and Emerson Shard Character Sets for players to enter the dungeons at launch with style and flair.</p><p><strong>Technical Test</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In addition, we’ve also announced a <em>King of Meat</em> Technical Test, which will run from August 23 at 6:00 p.m. BST until August 24 at 6:00 p.m. BST on Steam, PlayStation 5, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,769 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>, giving players around the world the opportunity to get an early look at <em>King of Meat</em>. The participant feedback from the technical test will help us deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p><p>Players can join by searching for either <em>King of Meat</em> on Steam or <em>King of Meat</em> – Technical Test on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Join with your squad or head to our Official Discord channel to grab some friends.</p><p>Hang out with your favorite Creator on Twitch for 30 minutes of cumulative watch time during the Technical Test to claim your Beta Rewards Top. This reward will carry over into the live game. If you haven’t done so already, make sure your Twitch account is linked to your Steam, Xbox, <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,334 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> account (depending on which platform you play on). Twitch Drops can only be claimed once per account.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>With the launch of <em>King of Meat</em> just a few weeks away, our teams at Glowmade and Amazon Games have provided an early overview of our values, player impact, and content strategy for the game.</p><p><strong>Our Values</strong></p><p>As Amazon Games and Glowmade worked together to develop the business model for <em>King of Meat</em>, we identified three core principles that embody our values, serve as our foundation, and guide our decision-making.</p><ul><li><strong>No Pay-to-Win</strong> – All purchases in-game are purely cosmetic with no gameplay impact, and can be earned by playing the game.<br>Choice: All cosmetics are completely optional.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> – There are no loot boxes or any other randomized form of monetization. This means that players always know exactly what they are buying and how much it costs.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Content</strong></p><p>There will be over 100 dungeons available at launch, but that number will quickly grow as the community pushes Create Mode to its limits. Most launch dungeons were meticulously crafted by Glowmade, while some came straight from the next generation of dungeon creators like you. These community-built dungeons were hand-picked from our ongoing playtests.</p><p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p><p><em>King of Meat</em> updates to the base game will be free for all players who’ve bought the game. While we aren’t ready to talk about post-launch support just yet, you can look forward to new game modes, player customisation options, Create Mode tools, regular events, dungeons, and more.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/king-of-meat-launches-october-7-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc-in-early-2026-for-switch]]></content:encoded>
