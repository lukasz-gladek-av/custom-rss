      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em> revealing villain Bawma portrayed by Lenny Kravitz. <span id="more-1013824"></span></p><p>“The <em>Bond</em> franchise has such an incredible legacy in video games, so to step into it with a brand-new character like Bawma is amazing,” said Lenny Kravitz in a press release. “He’s magnetic and unpredictable, there’s danger in him, but also heart and purpose. He’s not just a man with power; he is a man who has to fight for every inch of it. Bringing that energy into 007’s world felt incredible.”</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak added, “Lenny brings an extraordinary presence to 007 First Light. He is a one-of-a-kind performer, with unbelievable charisma, who fits perfectly with the character of Bawma. He captured exactly what we envisioned: a formidable man who commands both fear and loyalty, which will have a profound impact on Bond’s journey into the world of espionage.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Grammy Award winner Lenny Kravitz has joined the ensemble cast of <em>007 First Light</em> as The Pirate King Bawma, the charismatic and unpredictable leader of a powerful black-market arms network. Featuring the likeness and voiceover work from Lenny Kravitz in a video game for the first time, Bawma will be a figure who blurs the line between ally and adversary in Bond’s journey.</p><p>During The Game Awards, the Pirate King Bawma appeared in a brand-new trailer, holding James Bond as well as Bond’s mentor at MI6, John Greenway, in a delicate situation, aiming to remove any outside interference. Lenny Kravitz takes on the role of Bawma, providing both the voice and physical likeness of the character, his first major performance in a video game. Bawma is the enigmatic leader of Aleph, a vast black-market arms network operating across the Western hemisphere. By 17, he had risen through the ranks of modern piracy, transforming an abandoned ship graveyard in Mauritania into the foundation of his empire. </p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Our Story Will Haunt You</strong></p><p><em>Saros</em> is the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience. In our trailer at The Game Awards we focus on our mysterious and monstrous story and show how we are taking things to the next level. This is our biggest and most ambitious story yet at Housemarque.</p><p><em>Saros</em> is the haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse. You play as Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who will stop at nothing to find who he is looking for.</p><p>You may have noticed a mysterious corridor and bedroom which you will need to explore. In the interest of protecting our mystery I will let the trailer share what we want to share about our story so you can discover it ahead.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Arjun Devraj is performed by the brilliant Rahul Kohli, but he is not alone. We have an incredible ensemble cast of NPCs that deepen Carcosa’s world with their own perspectives and personalities for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Our Ensemble Cast Pulls You Into the World of <em>Saros</em></strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>For fans of Selene Vassos from <em><a title="Games > Returnal [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a></em>, the one and only Jane Perry is back as Sheridan Bouchard. Jerome Jackson is performed by fellow Aussie Ben Prendergast (<a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a> in <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a>: Ragnarok</em>), Sebastian Torres is performed by David DeSantos, and you can hear the fantastic Adriyan Raye (<em><a title="Games > South of Midnight [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a></em>) and Shunori Ramanthan in our trailer too. We have even more amazing cast members to share, they have all been exceptional.</p><p>You will meet our ensemble cast of NPCs in the Passage, our hub where you start each run, or in the world where you explore and discover their haunting stories through conversations, Soltari Hologram logs or audio logs.</p><p>Expect hard- hitting performances from our actors and narrative team at Housemarque to pull you into our new world with <em>Saros</em>. Our goal is to create an emotional, haunting, and powerful character study that explores the cost of what it takes to create a new future.</p><p><strong>Our Spectacular Bullet Ballet returns</strong></p><p>It would not be a Housemarque trailer without some bullet ballet. We hope you loved a sneak peak at Prophet and some action gameplay against Carcosan flora and fauna. As Arjun you will have to overcome a variety of hostile creatures and uncover their dark secrets by the end of our cinematic journey.</p><p>We also showed off a new ability, Parry, where with perfect timing of R1 you can reflect certain projectiles back at enemies, destroying or staggering them. It feels awesome to use and it’s another way we are taking out action to the next level.</p><p><strong>Digital Deluxe and Pre-Order Editions: 48- Hour Headstart With Digital Deluxe</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>For players who want the deluxe <em>Saros</em> experience: you will be able to play <em>Saros</em> 48 hours before launch with our Digital Deluxe Edition.

To make sure that <em>Saros</em> exceeds our vision, <em>Saros</em> will now release on April 30, 2026.</p><p>We cannot wait to share more about our game, how we push the PlayStation 5 hardware, and more from everyone working on S<em>a</em>ros.</p><p>Expect more news next year as we get closer to our launch, with a focus on our “Come Back Stronger” systems, eclipse escalation, and more extended gameplay for you all to enjoy.</p><p><em>Saros</em> is the next single-player, cinematic action game from Housemarque and our amazing collaborators.</p><p>A dream project made by a dream team.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/saros-delayed-to-april-30-2026]]></content:encoded>
