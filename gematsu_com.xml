        <p>Match cards with hololive characters on them to finish holo sets and unleash each character’s powerful unique skill! Get the most sets and the most points to beat your opponent!</p><p><strong>Multiple Modes?!</strong></p><p>Though matches form the bulk of this game, there is more than just hanafuda to this game! <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,000 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> Mode, for instance, takes players on a wild story-based adventure with their hololive friends—with a healthy dose of hanafuda to boot, of course. Then there’s the cozy bento box mode, where you can make bento lunch boxes alongside hololive characters, too. All this and more awaits you in <em>hololive Holo’s Hanafuda</em>!</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/hololive-holos-hanafuda/january-19-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_939182"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
