      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Coffee Stain Publishing [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/coffee-stain-publishing">Coffee Stain Publishing</a> and developer Easy Trigger Studios have announced <em><a title="Games > HUNTDOWN: OVERTIME [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/huntdown-overtime">HUNTDOWN: OVERTIME</a></em>, a “grindhouse <a title="Genres > Roguelite [329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite</a> prequel” to the <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,380 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> <em>Huntdown</em>. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q2 2026. <span id="more-1022448"></span></p><p>“<em>OVERTIME</em> is a very different game from the original <em>Huntdown</em>,” said <a title="Companies > Easy Trigger Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/easy-trigger-games">Easy Trigger Games</a> art director Tommy <a title="Companies > Gust [816 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a>afsson in a press release. “We’ve tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick. Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coffee Stain Publishing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Corporations turned <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e-infested streets into profit margins for bounty hunters and John Sawyer is going to make a killing. Hunt, die, upgrade, repeat in this explosive roguelite prequel where every strategic upgrade strips away more flesh and builds a cybernetic fighter one chrome limb at a time.</p><p><strong>Combat and Runs: Die Hard, Hunt Harder</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fast, violent run-and-gun action ripped straight from VHS-era blockbusters. Tight controls meet brutal firefights in a roguelite loop designed for pure adrenaline. Collect bounties and survive as long as you can. When you finally go down, Tony drags you back to his operating table and rebuilds you stronger.</p><p>Every run pushes you deeper into dangerous gang turf—from neon-soaked city streets to desolate wastelands. Choose your path, lock in on your targets, and adapt on the fly. Each death teaches you the patterns, each resurrection makes you deadlier. This is John Sawyer’s origin story: the transformation from man to cybernetic legend.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022452"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Weapons and Upgrades: Build the Perfect Killer</strong></p><p>Crank up the heat with a powerful arsenal of firearms, melee weapons and tactical gear. And if heat isn’t your thing, go for a cryomod and let an electric baton do the rest.</p><p>Discover cybernetic upgrades and weapon licenses buried in enemy territory. Make your upgrades permanent by unlocking them between runs and reshape how Sawyer fights. Reinforced limbs and experimental combat mods—hundreds of combinations to forge Sawyer into the killing machine that fits your style.</p><p>Each run offers fresh opportunities. Bank your earnings, invest in permanent enhancements, then jump back in with new capabilities. Adapt your approach: go loud with heavy firepower or slice through with bladed brutality. The city’s scum won’t know what hit them.</p><p><strong>Handcrafted Pixel Art Visuals</strong></p><p>Meticulous pixel art meets modern lighting in a stunning collision of retro craft and contemporary technique. This is pure early-80s B-movie aesthetics—bold reds on deep black and explosive contrasts. No pretty neon nostalgia, just VHS-era swagger.</p><p>Welcome to the grindhouse. Welcome to Overtime.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>2026 will bring a number of major updates to the game, kicking off with the player character update landing in the first quarter. Players will be able to update their ghost hunter with free cosmetics, with new character models and fine-tuned animations also being added; including equipment swapping, injecting tier three sanity medication, and new death and revive animations.</p><p>Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year. Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game’s launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0.</p><p>Alongside this, the genre-defining horror game will also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, following a successful release on PlayStation and Xbox in 2024. A Unity 6 and network update will also be rolling out across platforms, meaning a smoother gameplay experience for players.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Two map reworks will also be on the way as Tanglewood and 13  Willow Street  will both be getting revamped. Whilst Tanglewood’s map layout will remain similar to the original, players can expect a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes and more. For those with a keen eye, there’s also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>That’s not all, as there will be plenty more spooktacular surprises in store. A new map and one time event is also set to roll out, alongside the return of fan favourite seasonal events with Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye and Winter’s Jest all returning for the year.</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> with <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/phasmophobia-2026-roadmap-announced]]></content:encoded>
