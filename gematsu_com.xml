A release date was not announced. It will be playable at BitSummit the 13th, which runs from July 18 to 20 at Miyako Messe in Kyoto, Japan. <span id="more-978640"></span></p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Open the door and step into someone’s memories.</p><p><em>PLATONICA SPACE</em> is a psychological space exploration adventure in which you navigate countless interconnected rooms to find what you’ve lost: your memories.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You suddenly wake up in an unfamiliar room. You step through a door only to find yourself in yet another strange room. This mysterious space is a collection of interconnected rooms, coming one after the other with no exit in sight.</p><p>What’s worse, you’ve lost your memories. Inside the rooms, you run into other girls who also have no idea who they are or how they got here. But as you keep exploring, you realize something: these rooms are built from your memories. Yours and the other girls’.</p><p>Who are you?<br>Why are you here?<br>And how can you escape this seemingly endless collection of rooms?</p><p><strong>Restore Memories by Placing Items</strong></p><p>As you explore, you’ll find various items. Place them in specific spots to trigger memories associated with a specific combination of items and locations.</p><p>For example, placing a knife in a kitchen might bring back memories of <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>… but that same knife, placed in another room, could remind you of something entirely different.</p><p>However, not all the memories you’ll find will be your own. Some may belong to the other people trapped in this strange space. Sort through the memories, find out whom they belong to, and the truth will finally come into focus.</p><p><strong>A Shifting Space, Changing Every Time You Wake up</strong></p><p>Every time you fall asleep and wake up, you’ll find that the layout of the rooms, how they connect, and the items you find in them all change.</p><p>You can explore, find items, and uncover memories how many times you like, but remember: no two attemps will be the same.</p><p><strong>The More You Do, the Sleepier You Get</strong></p><p>Each <a title="Genres > Action [2,871 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> you take adds to your Sleepiness gauge. Once the gauge is full, you’ll fall asleep… and who knows where you’ll wake up.</p><p>You’ll also lose the items you were carrying, so you’ll need to carefully plan your every step, from the rooms you explore to the items you place in them.</p><p><strong>Meet the Others Trapped Within</strong></p><p>Just like you, the girls inside this space have lost their memories. As you find out more about them, they’ll surely repay the favor by giving you hints.</p><p>The real question is… should you trust them?</p><p>Everyone here has their own forgotten past and their own secrets. Uncovering those may be the key to learning the truth.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li>Published by: KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO</li><li>Scenario and Programming: Kazuhide Oka</li><li>3DCG and Art: Moe Katakura</li><li>Music: agehasprings <a title="Genres > Party [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></li><li>Logo Design: JEFF99</li><li>English Translation: Marco Godano</li><li>Simplified / Traditional Chinese Translation: flankoi</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/kamitsubaki-studio-and-kazuhide-oka-announce-psychological-space-exploration-adventure-game-platonica-space-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
