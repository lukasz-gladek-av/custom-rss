The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p><p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Never Forget About Your Gear</strong></p><p>No stalker embarks on an expedition unprepared. That’s where the new weapon comes in handy.</p><p>The GP37V2 is a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players.</p><p>It features a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope. The trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p><p>The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skillful operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power. And even if that somehow doesn’t sound like the best fit for your playstyle — you still have 30+ weapons (plus attachments) in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 to choose your favorite from.</p><p><strong>New Locations and Places</strong></p><p>As a bounty hunter, you need to explore, loot, and survive. Believe us when we say that the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine in Red Forest are worth your time.</p><p>If you have already travelled the Zone south-to-north and east-to-west, you’ll see some familiar locations are now re-inhabited by stalkers. The story will lead you through Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p><p>Your choices may also lead you to completely uncharted places. Trust your instincts to see how it pays off.</p><p><strong>New Hub in the Burnt Forest Region</strong></p><p>Your choice matters in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>—-and it literally shapes and changes the Zone. It stays true in this new story, as one of the outcomes is a whole new hub appearing in a not-so-populated area of Burnt Forest. Technician, trader, medic, guide—-everyone will be there. Of course, including a place to take a nap, and your stash!</p></blockquote><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,079 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chernobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-windows/9N3D6V4N58JR" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-free-story-content-update-launches-december-16]]></content:encoded>
