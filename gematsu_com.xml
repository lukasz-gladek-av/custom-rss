Additionally, we are all behind our teams’ efforts to create the most ambitious <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong note.”</p><p>Here is a message from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote on the delay:</p><blockquote><p>Dear players,</p><p>We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our incredible fans and dedicated teams for your unwavering support since our announcement in September to further refine and polish <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
