Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build <em>March of Giants</em> into one of the next great, enduring [multiplayer online battle arena games].”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and team, via Amazon Games:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>March of Giants</em> is an ambitious new entrant in the global multiplayer online battle arena landscape blending lane-based combat, battlefield mastery and hero coordination. Since its first reveal, the game has attracted strong enthusiasm from early players and creators, who have praised its fresh art direction, tactical depth, and focus on meaningful team play.</p><p>The worldwide multiplayer online battle arena category remains one of the largest and most engaged segments in gaming, representing hundreds of millions of active players and a significant opportunity for titles that can build loyal, competitive communities. Industry analysts expect the global multiplayer online battle arena games market to continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030.
