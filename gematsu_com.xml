      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Hyper Games [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hyper-games">Hyper Games</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > Moomintroll: Winter's Warmth [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moomintroll-winters-warmth">Moomintroll: Winter’s Warmth</a></em> in celebration of <em>Moomin</em>‘s 80th anniversary. <span id="more-1009047"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hyper Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>From the creators of <em><a title="Games > Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a></em> comes a heartwarming new adventure inspired by the beloved <em>Moomin</em> stories by Tove Jansson. This time, join Moomintroll himself on a charming but cold winter journey.</p><p>When Moomintroll unexpectedly wakes up early from his winter hibernation, he finds himself completely alone for the first time, in a world he barely recognizes. The familiar landscape of Moominvalley is now cloaked in the frosty veil of the Lady of the Cold. Initially seeking someone to care for him and longing to banish winter, young Moomintroll reluctantly embarks on a journey into the unknown, learning to forge new friendships and help those in greater need than himself.</p><p><em>Moomintroll: Winter’s Warmth</em> is a story-driven, cozy puzzle adventure that lets you return to the enchanting Moominvalley through the creative lens of the award-winning indie studio Hyper Games. While not a direct sequel to <em>Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</em>, it is a spiritual successor with many similarities. You can enjoy both games on their own, and in any order you’d like.</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><p>In a world of swords, magic, and fairies, you are a lone adventurer who suddenly becomes tasked to revive the ruined kingdom of Almacia along with the Fairy of Time, Chronos.</p><p>Through adventure (action) and revival (strategy), restore the kingdom to its former glory!</p></blockquote><!-- zp_shiv error: no images in gallery! --><blockquote><p><strong>■ Playable Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Imperial</strong></p><p>With high defense, Imperial is your reliable close-range fighter.</p><p>Her shield gives her guard abilities that allow her to safely get into range for her sword. Her easy-to-use skills, together with her unique counter action, give her a high maximum damage output.</p><p><strong>Alchemist</strong></p><p>Alchemist specializes in mixing potions to inflict statuses and other effects on enemies. Change the element of his bottles with a unique action, then inflict the perfect status effect for the situation.</p><p>His skills also apply a variety of debuffs, allowing him to consistently weaken his enemies.</p><p>Conversely, he has few direct attacks, so he’ll need to focus on status effects while he fights.</p><p><strong>Wizard</strong></p><p>Wizard fights from long range using a variety of magic attacks.</p><p>Her charge action can power up her magic before she casts it. Most of her actions will use SP (skill points), so you’ll need to keep an eye on it.</p><p>Her health and defense is low, so positioning is of utmost importance.</p><p><strong>Zipangu</strong></p><p>Skilled at attacking and dodging, Zipangu’s specialty is consecutive attacks.</p><p>He can get in close with a dodge move, then press the attack harder than any other character.</p><p>What he wants to do is rather simple: dodge, then attack back. However, his defense is lacking, so failing to dodge will be painful.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Players step into the role of Claire, a mercenary for hire who races, fights, hacks, and crashes her way through the ruins of The Dead Zone. In her quest to uncover her connection to A.I., she’ll uncover conspiracies, clash with gangs, track down tech-fantasia relics, and personalize her ride for maximum style and destruction.</p><p>Players can look forward to puzzle-filled dungeons with twin-stick combat, overworld exploration on wheels, rock n’ roll style <a title="Genres > Racing [310 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>, <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> and mods, all wrapped in a post-apocalyptic world seething with retro style and synthwave.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After a great cataclysm, what’s left is a post-apocalyptic world dominated by an A.I. with rebel groups that take refuge in a desert area known as The Dead Zone.</p><p>Claire survives in this world by executing black market contracts for local leaders involving delivery, sabotage and murder. The Dead Zone, now not so dead, is occupied by three rival factions: The Wasteheads, The SaibaKuran, and Order of the New Code.</p><p>While investigating her past, Claire uncovers strange evidence that links her existence to the origin of the A.I.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Part exploration on-wheels, part dungeon crawler, <em>RoadOut</em> shifts between retro-style behind-the-wheel action and on-foot brawling. Switch from turbo-charged chases to twin-stick shootouts. Drive into run-down city hubs, take on underground side quests, and blow up dangerous hideouts. Players can upgrade both Claire and her ride with body mod and vehicular customization, while scouring the world for items to craft their own items, weapons and upgrades.</p><p><strong>Key features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore the World on Wheels</strong> – The world is no longer the same. All that remains is The Dead Zone, a large artificial biome created to sustain a new era of humanity. Drive through The Dead Zone doing jobs, getting paid and running roughshod over the scum guarding the secrets of the world. Join factions, fight rival gangs, barter items and take up quests to earn clout while progressing Claire’s story.</li><li><strong>Twin Stick Combat and Dungeon Exploration</strong> – Exit your ride and explore locations in the world of <em>RoadOut</em> on foot. Crush bandits with short and long range attacks, block with your shield, and recover using drugs that you’ve crafted on the way. Solve puzzles using fully rotatable stack <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a> perspectives that look 2D, but are actually 3D.</li><li><strong>Body Mods and Cybernetics</strong> – Craft new moves, weapons and drugs to survive. You can customize Claire with body mods, cybernetics and an intricate skill tree system. Upgrade her car to traverse different terrain and withstand the effects of weather, night and day.</li><li><strong>Battle in Your Bitchin’ Ride</strong> – Equipped with weapons and other tech, Claire’s car is your best friend against dangers in The Dead Zone. Hungry animals are ready to rip you apart. Murderous bandits will rob your lifeless corpse. Prepare for the worst with your car and its arsenal of weapons.</li><li><strong>Race for Glory</strong> – The world may have come to an end, but who said we can’t have fun? Ride or die in red-hot races to be the best on the post apocalyptic circuit. 10 tracks in multiple biomes, innumerable races, all of them equal measures deadly and glorious. Indulge in extra game modes such as destruction derby-style racing and twisted battle arena, all while roading out to a thumping synthwave soundtrack.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="RoadOut - Release Date Trailer | Nintendo Switch.
