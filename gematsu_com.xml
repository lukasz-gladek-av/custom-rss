It also stars two new characters with different playstyles, Kirika and <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ha, who players can switch between in order to fully explore the vast areas and take down enemies and bosses.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You must search far and wide for the means to revive Kirika and Mashaâs master, the Demon Lord Maxim, and restore him to power. In this upside-down world, youâll fight alongside demons and against demons, as well as Demon Hunters from the Human Realm. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure!</p><p><strong>Adventure Through the Vast Demon Realm to Revive Your Allies!</strong></p><p>The critically acclaimed action of <em>Gal Guardians: Demon Purge</em> comes to a fully-realized Metroidvania! Countless combos and possibilities await as you explore the Demon Realm with two upgradable characters.</p><p>Search for hidden passages, trap doors, and solve puzzles throughout the Demon Realm to collect the scattered bones of the Demon Lord Maxim. The sub-weapons and abilities youâve unlocked for the heroines Kirika and Masha will open up new routes and strategies, so youâll need to try every tool at your disposal!</p><p>In addition, each of Maximâs vassals you find and revive will help strengthen your home base, the Demon Lordâs castle.

Older sister Kirika attacks from a distance with demonic guns while her younger sister Masha covers close ranges with her whip. They can spend demonic energy to attack with different sub-weapons as well, but it is crucial to switch between the two as the situation changes.</p><p>Should one of the sisters be defeated, you can bring her back to life by returning to her location and using âSister Rescueâ to revive her. Also, two player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> play is available both local and online*!

Youâll use these items to unlock new special abilities for the sisters and access new areas of the map. Sub-weapons can be combined and crafted to customize their power, making use of items you wouldnât otherwise need.</p><p><strong>Choose the Play âStyleâ Thatâs Right for You!</strong></p><p><em>Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark</em> inherits the âStyleâ system of its predecessor, allowing you choose between âCasual,â âVeteran,â and âLegend.â You can switch Styles at any time, and all of the gameâs content is available no matter what you choose.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="ã°ãªã ã»ã¬ã¼ãã£ã¢ã³ãº ãµã¼ã´ã¡ã³ãã»ãªãã»ã¶ã»ãã¼ã¯ - ç¬¬ä¸å¼¾ç´¹ä»æ å" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giEooYbF2SU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tired, hungry and still employed he will need to explore the unknown in order to craft the machines that will turn his broken space module into a self-sufficient base of operations. And maybe kickstart civilization again, if he has the time.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore, Scan, and Catalogue</strong> â Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with quirky fauna, flora and climate events. Classify every animal, plant and mineral in order to help you survive the passing of seasons. Knowledge is your greatest weapon. But donât try to use knowledge against certain animals, you WILL get eaten.</li><li><strong>Craft It to the Limit</strong> â Use every material at your disposal in order to build your base. Start small by turning bone and wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal and slowly but surely grow your base into a full blown resource generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.</li><li><strong>Surviveâ¦ or Not! Youâll Be Cloned Anwyays</strong> â Even though Kent will be revived endless times, that does not change the fact that dying is a major drag. In order to not bite the dust constantly he will need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes and polish his <a title="Genres > Cooking [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> skills. Build your own farms and vivariums to create a steady source of nourishment.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
