The story is designed to layer action with deep emotional impact, as players face the consequences of Time Dilation on their choices, creating unpredictable outcomes that affect their loved ones, their legacy, and their entire civilization—for generations.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>EXODUS</em>, humanity has fled a dying Earth, finding a new home in a hostile galaxy – here, we are the underdogs fighting for <a title="Genres > Survival [364 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>. As The Traveler, you are humanity’s last hope. Your job is to steal alien weapons and technology from the most powerful beings in the universe, the Celestials—humanity’s greatest enemy. But there’s a catch—Time Dilation. As Travelers on interstellar missions, days for you are decades back home. The sacrifices you make to protect your loved ones create unpredictable consequences that change your world—reshaping the future. Returning home, you confront the consequences of your choices. In Exodus, the outcome of those choices manifests at a massive level, compounding over generations.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Emotional Impact of Time Dilation</strong> – Time Dilation escalates the emotional impact of your story-driven choices like never before. Traveling on interstellar missions at the edge of lightspeed, time moves differently — days for you can be years, decades or even centuries for those back home. The world you fight so hard to save moves on without you, changing and evolving while you are left behind. In your absence, friends and family will grow old and change, while you remain the same, forcing you to exist outside of time.</li><li><strong>Explore A Universe of Possibilities</strong> – As the Traveler, you navigate the stars on missions to steal alien weapons and technology from the most powerful beings in the universe and humanity’s greatest enemy, the Celestials. These remnants are used to fight a destructive force that threatens the entire galaxy, including your homeworld. Through exploration, you gain an understanding of your universe, the Celestials, and how you are connected to the fate of humanity.</li><li><strong>Lead A Diverse Cast of Companions</strong> – As humanity’s savior you will lead a diverse set of companions in your fight for humanity, many of whom have their own quest and romance paths. Willing to brave unfathomable danger, and to stare into the abyss at your side, they are ready to join you in facing whatever arises. These are not just brave soldiers—they are genetically engineered savants, punk mech pilots, geniuses cursed with alien viruses and more.</li><li><strong>Own Your Journey</strong> – In <em>EXODUS</em>, you have the agency to customize your experience, from your character to your progression, combat style and the companions you choose. With each mission you grow more powerful as you progress from a lowly salvager to humanity’s last hope. As you infiltrate dangerous alien strongholds, you’ll need to decide which combat tactics and strategies you’ll use to exploit your enemy’s weakness.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>EXODUS</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,573 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,512 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,006 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.
