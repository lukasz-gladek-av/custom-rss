        <p>Harness the elements in fierce real-time battles while gathering and upgrading a crew of fantasy creatures in this roguelite adventure across a world torn apart by war.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_938591"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Systemic Elemental System</strong> – <em>Wartorn</em> features a systemic, emergent gameplay system using the elements of fire, water, tar, plant, and lightning. Strategically choose your squads to master the elements and environment against hordes of enemies. Water extinguishes fire, tar amplifies fire, electricity crackles across the ranks in wet conditions, and water can heal plant-based units. And that’s just scratching the surface!</li><li><strong>Squad-Based Combat</strong> – Build out your Caravan by recruiting squads of fantasy creatures including goblins, elves, demons, treefolk, (and more!) as you travel the world. Each squad adds new strategic options to your caravan through their different characteristics and unique abilities. Mix and match what squads you bring into battle to truly master a run. Battlefield positioning, squad combos, and skillful usage of abilities can win the day, but be careful, losses cost you morale, and if your caravan loses hope it’s game over.</li><li><strong>Strategic Replayability</strong> – The game’s blend of strategic and roguelite elements offer deep replayability, with each run feeling fresh thanks to emergent gameplay, dynamic squad <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and unpredictable narrative events that can save your struggling band or cost them their lives.</li><li><strong>Locating Your Lost Family</strong> – Search the Isles of Talaur to meet Yara and Elani’s family, who reveal pieces of the game’s story and grant the player heirlooms that bring with them new advantages and abilities for future runs.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
