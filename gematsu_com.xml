    <p><span>Plus major updates to Tetris Time Warp.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Digital Eclipse [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a> have released the biggest free update for <em><a title="Games > Tetris Forever [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tetris-forever">Tetris Forever</a></em> yet, which includes major updates for <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> and adds new classic MS-DOS games <em>Super Tetris</em> and <em>Tetris</em> version 3.12 by AcademySoft. <span id="more-946775"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features of the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> Update</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Blast Off to Level 30</strong> – The single-player modes in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which previously topped out at Level 15, now go all the way to Level 30! Can you handle even higher speeds of play? Starting at Level 20, the Time Warp Tetrimino piece will no longer feature the golden-colored Tetrimino, so you won’t be able to create Matrix-clearing cascades. And starting on Level 28, the lockdown speed of Tetriminos will greatly increase.</li><li><strong>Time Warp Shield</strong> – In <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, the Time Warp Tetriminos now have a new power – Shield! <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r a line including a Time Warp Tetrimino while the Shield design is showing, and you’ll earn a Shield that will stop other players from sending you into a Time Warp. It disappears after being used once.</li><li><strong>1989 Mode Upgrades</strong> – Enjoy playing <em>Tetris</em> with black-and-white graphics and <a title="Companies > chiptune" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/chiptune">chiptune</a> sounds? 1989 Mode, a single-player mode found within <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, now has a variety of fixes and new options. You can choose to turn off “Modern Gameplay” and experience more historically accurate gameplay. You can also optionally choose to play the game with 18 rows in the Matrix, as opposed to the modern-day setting of 20 rows.</li><li><strong>Take the 40-Line Challenge</strong> – Celebrate <em>Tetris</em>‘ 40th anniversary by trying to clear 40 lines as quickly as you can. Playable in both Modern and 1989 modes.</li><li><strong>Options, Options, Options</strong> – A vastly expanded Options menu lets you customize the visuals, sounds, and gameplay in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> to your liking. Turn individual graphic effects on or off, and tweak your gameplay with new options like the Initial Hold and Initial Rotation systems, Diagonals, and more.</li></ul><p>Many other bug fixes, tweaks, and minor changes to all modes to improve the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> experience.</p><p><strong>New MS-DOS Games Added to <em>Tetris Forever</em></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong><em>Super Tetris</em></strong> – Released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1991, this was an early attempt at creating a “sequel” to <em>Tetris</em>. The gameplay is quite different — the Matrix is half-full of garbage when a game begins, and players can earn and use Bombs to clear out the spaces and find power-ups buried in the garbage. It includes Cooperative and Competitive multiplayer modes, in which two players play in the same Matrix!</li><li><strong><em>Tetris</em> (AcademySoft) v. 3.12</strong> – A historically important inclusion, this is the final version of <em>Tetris</em> created within the Soviet Union in the Academy of Sciences, ported from Alexey Pajitnov’s original Pascal code by Vadim Gerasimov. Dating to 1988, it is notable for its inclusion of Phantom mode, in which all O-Tetriminos (square-shaped pieces) are invisible!</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Updates</strong></p><ul><li>The gameplay behaviors in the recreation of the Electronika 60 version of <em>Tetris</em> have been updated to be even more historically accurate to the original version.</li><li>Now includes language support for Korean and Traditional Chinese.</li><li>Many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements have been made to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,751 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,469 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
