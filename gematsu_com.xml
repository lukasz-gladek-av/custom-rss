It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,720 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1004892"></span></p><p>In a message, the companies said the delay is the result of “[quality assurance] [hitting] a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable,” which fixing would require pushing the console release back due to certification timelines, and they would rather not release for all platforms at once, versus PC first and consoles later.</p><p>Here is the full message from Playstack and D-CELL:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! <em>UNBEATABLE</em> was supposed to come out tomorrow!</p><p>That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: <em>UNBEATABLE</em> will now release on December 9.</p><p>I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why Would You Only Tell Me Now?</strong></p><p>Because the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>But Why? The Game’s Done, Right?</strong></p><p>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; [quality assurance] hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of [certification] timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.</p><p><strong>But Why Not Just Delay the Release of the Console Port?</strong></p><p>That’s very messy! We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody.</p><p><strong>But Why Release on December 9? That’s a Whole Month Away!</strong></p><p>Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.</p><p><strong>…But is the Game Good?</strong></p><p>It’s very good, and I’m very biased. We’ll see what reviewers think. But for those of you waiting the longest for this thing to come out, it makes me feel a bit crazy knowing how much you still don’t know about what’s this thing is. I’m very excited about it. I wish it could have been tomorrow, but.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who’s rooted for us up until this point. It’s not much longer now.</p><p>—RJ Lake and everyone at D-CELL and Playstack</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/unbeatable-delayed-to-december-9]]></content:encoded>
