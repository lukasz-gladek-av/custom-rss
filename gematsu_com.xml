            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A “Deluxe Edition” will also be available for $44.99, which includes the following content:</p><p>Netmarble also released a <a href="https://slvariseoverdrive.netmarble.com/en/news/1/3" target="_blank">Developer Note</a> detailing the core gameplay features and philosophy behind the game, emphasizing that the game is a premium title separate from the mobile game&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Solo Leveling: ARISE" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/solo-leveling-arise">Solo Leveling: ARISE</a></em>, in which Hunters, weapons for Sung Jinwoo and other Hunters, and growth systems are unlocked through gameplay. It also elaborates on creating a distinct experience for consoles and PC, with standalone systems, narrative depth, and controls.</p><div><p><strong>■ Greetings, Hunters!</strong></p><p>I am Kim Gwang Hoon, the development producer of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>We are thrilled to greet you for the first time as the development team behind <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>With <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> already receiving so much love, developing a new game for PC and console players has brought us not only great excitement and anticipation but also a fair share of fear and serious contemplation about venturing into the unknown.</p><p>Still, the desire to reinterpret the epic journey of <em>Solo Leveling</em> in a new dimension, and to present new experiences and deeper gameplay aimed at PC and console that couldn’t be explored in <em>ARISE</em>, has driven our strong spirit of challenge. <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is our bold new venture.</p><p>We understand that many of you may have questions about our new game.</p><p>To the current players of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>, we deeply empathize with your feelings that the arrival of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> might mean we’re turning our attention away from <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>. And to those of you waiting for <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, we also recognize the concern that it might end up as nothing more than a simple port of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>.</p><p>But please rest assured, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is an entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> will continue to evolve on its own path, aiming to provide the best possible gameplay experience. At the same time, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed as a distinct PC/console title with its own unique identity. We are doing our utmost to ensure that both projects live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, allow us to share more about how <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a New Game <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong></p><p>What we would like to emphasize first and foremost is that <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a full-package game. Rather than relying on randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons, we’ve designed the game to reward effort and strategy, allowing you to feel a true sense of achievement. All the Hunters, Sung Jinwoo and their weapons, and the joy of progression can be earned and enjoyed entirely through in-game play.</p><p><strong>Hunter Recruitment</strong></p><p>By Sung Jinwoo’s side stands not only his shadows, but also many skilled Hunters who fight alongside him. In <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, you can offer each Hunter a payment worthy of their abilities and recruit them to join you in battle.</p><p><strong>Weapon <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a></strong></p><p>As a player, you can directly choose and craft your own weapons. Defeat powerful bosses and use the materials you obtain to forge formidable weapons for Sung Jinwoo and the Hunters. By combining various weapons and skill trees, you’ll be able to create a unique combat style that’s entirely your own.</p><p><strong>■ What Sets <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> Apart</strong></p><p>The passion of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> now burns anew on PC and console with <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is built upon two core values.</p><p>First, <strong>deeper and more refined <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a></strong>.</p><p>We’ve designed the controls to suit PC and console platforms, maximizing the thrill of weighty and precise combat.</p><p>Second, <strong>overwhelming immersion</strong>.</p><p>A world brought to life with next-level PC and console graphics that will fully draw fans into the game’s story, delivering a truly immersive experience.</p><p><strong>■ Visuals That Deepen Immersion</strong></p><p>We’ve pushed the visual quality of the game to its highest level, so that you can become fully immersed in the world of <em>Solo Leveling</em>.</p><p><strong>Background Level Up</strong></p><p>Now, You Are There. To bring the iconic moments from the webtoon to life more vividly, we’ve significantly enhanced the detail and quality of the game’s environments. Though the game is based on the original webtoon, the backgrounds are portrayed in a style that bridges the gap between comic and realism, allowing you to not only feel as if you’ve stepped into the webtoon itself, but to experience a whole new level of immersion.</p><p><strong>Character Level Up</strong></p><p>A brand-new customization system has been added, just for you.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo: Styled, Chosen, Completed by You</strong></p><p>You can personalize Sung Jinwoo by selecting his hairstyle and hair color, and equipping various facial accessories to create a version of him that’s truly one of a kind.</p><p><strong>Highlight Your <a title="Genres > Party [104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>‘s <a title="Series > Persona [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lity</strong></p><p>You can also freely change the hair color of your fellow Hunters, letting their individuality shine even more. Mix and match hairstyles and colors across multiple Hunters to create a party that reflects your unique style.</p><p><strong>■ Combat with Strategic Depth</strong></p><p>We’ve built a combat system that goes beyond simple <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a>, maximizing the thrill of strategic decision-making and precise control.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo Skill Tree</strong></p><p>Sung Jinwoo’s growth is entirely in your hands. Choose and develop various skill trees, even the same Jinwoo can have a completely different combat style depending on your decisions. Grow him your way, with your own strategy.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 1: The Monarch System</strong></p><p>It’s Time to Turn the Tide of Battle. We’ve implemented a Monarch Transformation system, a powerful feature that lets Sung Jinwoo awaken as the Monarch of Shadows. In this form, Jinwoo unleashes devastating skills that overwhelm enemies and dominate the battlefield. Based on your feedback, we’re actively enhancing the impact and speed of combat to deliver an even more intense and overwhelming battle experience. Get ready for a fight that feels truly powerful.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 2: Parry System</strong></p><p>Take command of the battlefield. The parry system lets you precisely block enemy attacks, offering the thrill of skillful control and heightening the tension of each encounter. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully parry an attack to trigger a QTE, allowing you to exploit enemy openings and land a devastating counterstrike.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 3: <a title="Companies > Enhance [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Hit Impact and Damage Feedback</strong></p><p>Feel every moment of battle as if you were truly there. From the impact of striking enemies to the intensity of taking hits, every sensation has been amplified to deliver unmatched immersion, making it feel like you’ve thrown yourself right into the fight. Every blow and every hit will set your heart <a title="Genres > Racing [272 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Battle Even More 1: Overdrive System</strong></p><p>The Overdrive System is being developed to maximize Sung Jinwoo’s skill tree and each Hunter’s unique traits, delivering overwhelming fun in combat.</p><p>With his skill tree—based Overdrive System, Sung Jinwoo dominates the battlefield. For example, when using the “Duel” skill tree, a special gauge will appear on the battle HUD. Once this gauge is filled to 100%, you can unleash a powerful skill specialized for that tree.</p><p>Hunters can showcase their individuality in combat through their own unique Overdrive Systems. For example, the Hunter Choi Jong-In can unleash meteors around him after applying Burn to enemies a certain number of times, shaking the battlefield with abilities that highlight his distinctive traits.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Battle Even More 2: Chain Smash System</strong></p><p>The Chain Smash System is a core mechanic that maximizes the synergy between skills. Triggered through additional input right after using a skill, Chain Smash grows stronger the more you chain it together.</p><p>By strategically deciding when to activate Chain Smash during your combos, you’ll experience an entirely new level of combat excitement.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>‘s Variety of Content</strong></p><p><strong>Cute Companion, Yaruru</strong></p><p>Adorable shadows have flown in from another world to assist Hunters. Yaruru diligently picks up items, gathers resources, and always supports you faithfully by your side.

There was no grand apocalyptic event to speak of; only the cruel march of time and the inexplicable infertility of the world led us here. Accursed creatures stalk the barren lands between settlements, which are themselves terrible places; squalid, medieval, and mostly ruled by tyrants.</p><p>This tale begins in the town of Draenog, your theatre performance interrupted by fighting at the gates. Demons have arrived. As a simple thespian, your wooden prop sword will have to do for now; you must gather the troupe and defend yourselves!</p><!-- AD: content -->
