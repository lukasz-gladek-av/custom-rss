The primary goal of the test is to verify server stability and identify critical bugs. While some content will be limited, the test aims to provide a gameplay experience that closely resembles the live service. The Server Slam Test will run for 72 hours, from February 19, 2026, 18:00 p.m. to February 22, 2026, 18:00 p.m. (PDT).</p><p>The test build will feature a variety of new content previously introduced in developer notes. This includes the new boss mutant “Yacha,” along with newly added normal and elite mutants, and the implementation of an elite / boss-exclusive equipment system. In addition, players can experience enhanced anti-cheat measures, user interface / user experience improvements based on player feedback gathered during Steam Next Fest, overall optimization updates and new cosmetic content.</p><p><em>THE CUBE, SAVE US</em> previously gained significant attention during Steam Next Fest, achieving 3rd place in peak concurrent players and “Top 8” in the global popular demo rankings. Taking these results into account, XLGAMES plans to further refine the game’s overall quality through the Server Slam Test.</p><p>Meanwhile, XLGAMES has scheduled Steam Early Access for Q1 2026. The upcoming Server Slam Test will serve as a final comprehensive evaluation of both service stability and gameplay quality ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
