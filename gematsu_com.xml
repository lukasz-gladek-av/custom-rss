A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos.</p><p>As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High Octane Hybrid Combat</strong> – Built on the legacy of <em>Warhammer 40,000: Vermintide II</em>‘s best-in-class melee combat, <em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em> introduces intense <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>&nbsp;gunplay to the mix.

The choice is yours.</li><li><strong>Tertium: A Hive City on the Brink of Collapse</strong> – Step into the violent, dystopian world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall—Tertium Hive is a hard and unforgiving place even at the best of times. Your role is to serve the zealous Inquisition by embarking on missions to exterminate the threats lurking in the depths of the hive city, or die trying.</li><li><strong>Chaos Never Sleeps</strong> – Adapt to the erratic whims of Chaos with conditions- mutators that add a spontaneous challenge to your mission.
