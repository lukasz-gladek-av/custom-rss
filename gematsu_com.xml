        <p>A wide variety of newly added playable characters!</p><p>Supports online rankings and various achievements!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Control the character with an 8-way lever and two buttons (shot, bomb).</p><p><strong>Character Selection</strong></p><p>Players select one of several characters with different normal attacks, shikigami attacks, special attacks, and movement speeds.</p><p>You can also choose between the first and second types of attack, which have different performance for each character, allowing for a variety of attack methods.</p><p>You can also play with two players.

The points you get with a normal attack increase, and the number of coins that appear increases even more with a Shikigami attack.</p><p><strong>High Tension MAX System</strong></p><p>Equipped with a new function that satisfies your insatiable passion for shooting games!</p><p>A system that consumes one special attack to activate. There is a short period of invincibility when activated. A red gauge will be displayed at the top edge of the screen for a certain period of time, and until it runs out, “T.B.S. judgment will always be 8 times (≒ always in a high-tension shot state)” and “the amount of coins appearing will be 1.5 times.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Steam Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam &quot;Castle of Shikigami 3&quot; Promotional Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEMzQQ8jE0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam『式神の城Ⅲ』プロモーションビデオ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWQEGhsXoPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players will experience the opening tutorial and introduction, character and mech customization, an explorable space station, all three core game modes, a training room, and thirteen distinct mechs or “Strikers.” Other new updates in this beta include revised maps for the six-versus-six Operation VERGE and three-versus-three Ace Arena game modes, a player reputation system, balance adjustments to various Strikers, combat finishing moves, and new customization options for pilots and mechs.</p><p>The all new player-versus-player-versus-environment mode “Mashmak”—available to the public for the first time—sees pilots battling over the Mashmak Isles, which hold the largest reserves of Eruptive Inorganic Carbide (EIC), also known as “Corite.” The region recently came under the control of an organization known as Theia’s Vanguard, and their destructive actions are accelerating the spread of Corite, pushing the world to the brink of disaster. Constant battle for control of the islands has created unpredictable Corite pulse storms, which are capable of devouring everything in their path.</p><p>To handle these harsh conditions, new equipment has been developed to give Striker pilots an advantage. Pilots can choose to deploy a selection of new equipment including weapon pickups and weaponized gliders to dynamically enhance their Striker’s capabilities in close-quarters combat, healing, sniping, suppressive fire, and more in order to complete the mission. As the battle rages on, more powerful weapons and equipment will be made available for the truly hardened pilot.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mecha BREAK</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, followed by PlayStation 5 later in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade, and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Home to the world’s greatest minds, GATE operates a global network of secretive research laboratories, spanning every field of scientific study—and the realms beyond.</p><p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable—including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect—known as The Order—is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home—for now.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> brings a 90s science-fiction twist and rich character progression to the <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> open world survival crafting genre.

As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps – everything your big science brain can muster!</li><li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong> – Make yourself at home—you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.</li><li><strong>Form the Ultimate Think Tank</strong> – Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.</li><li><strong>Survive to See Your Next Day Off</strong> – Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional science-fiction <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Abiotic Factor - Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFAE8NENDHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <ul><li><strong>Drafting Your Journey</strong> – Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets. But be careful how you draft, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms you saw today may not be the same rooms you see tomorrow.</li><li><strong>Every Step Counts</strong> – Your progress each day is shaped by the rooms you select to draft and the tools you find within them. Items in the game can be used in a number of creative ways to fuel your exploration deeper into the house, allowing you to adopt unique strategies to combat the challenges that each day brings. Yet, tread wisely – the house resets each dawn, erasing all but the permanent upgrades to your estate blueprint.

Yet as your journey takes you further into the mansion’s depths, you start to discover that there is more lurking under the surface than a missing room. Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail, political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children’s book author. The deeper you venture, the more you realize that the past is closer than it appears.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
