Think again.</p><p>Unlockable after completing the game, New Game+ reimagines the first seven chapters of <em>Total Chaos</em>, twisting familiar locations into far more hostile gauntlets and culminates in a brand-new final chapter: “Chapter 8: Reckoning.” Each existing chapter begins with a warning: something has been unleashed. Once The Hunter finds his target, there is no way to stop him. Survival depends on speed, awareness, and decision-making under pressure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027223"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In addition to The Hunter, enemy encounters are significantly more aggressive, resources are brutally scarce, and hesitation is punished. New Game+ is not designed for comfort. It is a deliberate escalation, intended for players willing to face Total Chaos at its most unforgiving. It is meant to push players to the absolute brink, and even after all hope is lost, it continues to punish. </p><p>Beyond its mechanical escalation, New Game+ also expands Total Chaos’ narrative. A new ending extends the story beyond its original conclusion, offering new context for the protagonist’s descent into Fort Oasis—and what it all ultimately meant.</p></blockquote><p><em>Total Chaos</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,449 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,750 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/total-chaos/9phtx5qz035t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.
