      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Cooldown Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cooldown-games">Cooldown Games</a>, an independent publisher of console and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,949 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> games, has announced its establishment. It is founded by industry veterans with experience from multiple top-tier game companies including Gearbox Entertainment, <a title="Companies > id Software [152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/zenimax-media/id-software">id Software</a>, and Warner Bros., and will focus on delivering “premium titles that emphasize bringing more refined gaming experiences that players can enjoy at their own pace without the need of large time investments.” <span id="more-933531"></span></p><p>The company’s founders include:</p><ul><li>Steve Gibson, chief executive officer – Former president of <a title="Companies > Gearbox Publishing [110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-gearbox-entertainment-company/gearbox-publishing">Gearbox Publishing</a></li><li>Matt Charles, chief product officer</li><li>Erick Cobbs, chief business officer</li><li>Jackson Hardesty, chief operations officer</li><li>Brad Schliesser, chief revenue officer</li><li>Jimmy Sieben, chief technology officer</li><li>Jeff Skal, chief marketing officer</li></ul><p>“Our team is confident rational business models will be a long-term strength of Cooldown Games and that just might be a refreshing contrast from many recent industry trends,” said Cooldown Games CEO Steve Gibson in a press release. “My passion of helping game makers reach as many game players as possible while making sure that it’s a rewarding experience for everyone involved is at the center of all of this. Let’s make some great games together.”</p><p>Cooldown Games chief marketing officer Jeff Skal added, “Over the last five years, we all individually noticed that we’ve been gravitating away from many of the predictable new releases. We noticed that was because most of us already have ‘forever’ games—for me and Brad that’s <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and for Jackson that’s <em>DayZ</em>—and most of these giant new releases were just asking for more than we could give. When we started Cooldown Games, we quickly realized that there’s a ton of gamers out there just like us—and we wanted to find the best games that can fit in between our sessions, or seasons, or even just after raid night.”</p><p>Chief product officer Matt Charles said, “Many talented developers weathered the recent industry turbulence and now more than ever seek a partner that understands their project’s vision and how it will resonate with an audience. We are looking to work with astute and passionate teams that share our philosophy and observation about player behavior, and we can create a force-multiplying partnership on the path to release.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
