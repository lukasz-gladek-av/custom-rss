Not only have I been able to bring my unique ideas to life, but I’ve also had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people along the way.”</p><p>poncle founder Luca Galante added, “NaoGames shares the poncle spirit of making games that are immediately accessible, affordable, and a bit out of the ordinary; for fun. When I first met Shibata-san and played <em>Berserk or Die</em>, I knew this was a game that deserved to be seen and played by more people. I’m really happy we got to support Shibata-san and hopefully make that happen.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via poncle:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Berserk or Die</em>, players take on the role of a lone soldier left standing on a ravaged battlefield, fending off the hordes of enemies swarming from left and right. To survive, players must buy from peddlers, hit the training grounds, and mash as many keys on their keyboard as possible without voiding their warranty. Movement in each stage is controlled entirely by attacks, so players don’t need to reach a specific destination, just survive the onslaught. The more keys you press, the more devastating your attacks will become – and if keyboards aren’t for you, controllers work just as well, plus further accessibility options.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But really, <em>Berserk or Die</em> is all about the satisfaction of landing a perfectly-timed hit and watching foes fly across the screen in a flurry of pixels time and time again.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Fight against hordes of enemies as the last soldier standing on battlefields from both history and fantasy.</li><li>Strike your keyboard left and right to attack; the more keys you strike, the wilder and more powerful your moves.</li><li>The keyboard is used not just as a controller, but as an extension of the player’s movements, allowing them to face off against multiple enemies with their own hands.</li><li>Once your special gauge is full, shake your mouse to use your special move and wipe through the enemies on screen in one dramatic move.</li><li>Browse the wares of peddlers at nightfall, buying magical items to heal and power up.</li><li>Visit the training grounds to learn powerful new skills that transform you into a force to be reckoned with.</li><li><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> all of the action in a unique pixel art style synonymous with the game’s creator, Nao Shibata.</li><li>Original soundtrack by <em><a title="Games > Vampire Survivors [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a></em> composer, Filippo Vicarelli.</li><li>Accessibility options available for controls, in addition to the main keyboard and mouse setup.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="poncle presents | Berserk or Die - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MddYxr07bfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Join Carter on his journey to find his missing <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter, utilizing his Spirit Strike Martial Art skills in the stylish wasteland. With razor-sharp responsiveness and explosive visual flair, the game delivers a combat experience as intense as it is expressive.</p><p>At launch, the Early Access version will feature six stages and six boss battles. These levels are packed with enemy variety, unique terrains, and escalating challenges that reward aggressive experimentation and replayability. </p><p>Players can test their skills across four carefully balanced difficulty modes, making the game accessible to newcomers while offering a fierce challenge to <a title="Genres > Action [2,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> veterans. The highest difficulty level can only be unlocked after beating the game, which will feature entirely new and more unforgiving enemy combinations that will constantly test players to adapt and choose their priority.</p><p>A standout feature of <em>Spirit X Strike</em> is its three distinct combat styles, which players can switch between at any moment. Each style introduces a different tempo, technique, and combo potential, encouraging experimentation and strategic adaptation mid-fight.</p><!-- AD: content -->
