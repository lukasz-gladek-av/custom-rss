The Switch version will only be published by Forever Entertainment in North America and Europe, while Wonderland Kazakiri will handle publishing in Japan and Asia. The PC version will be published by Wonderland Kazakiri worldwide.</p><p><em>CASSETTE BOY</em> will also be playable at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which will run from September 25 to 28 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Wonderland Kazakiri:</p><blockquote><p>“Does the <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a> cease to exist when I am not looking at it?”</p><p>This famous question, often attributed to Einstein, highlights the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Inspired by this idea, <em>CASSETTE BOY</em> introduces the unique “Schrodinger System,” where objects outside of your view simply vanish from the world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At first glance, the visuals may resemble classic pixel art. In reality, the entire game is built in 3D. By rotating the camera and shifting perspectives, players solve puzzles in entirely new ways. For example, if an object is hidden behind a wall and you cannot see it, it no longer exists. Obstacles such as NPCs, monsters, arrows you’ve fired, or even bombs can disappear simply by changing your viewpoint—opening the path forward.</p><p>Classic-looking pixel art and familiar puzzle tropes are given surprising twists. In this world, puzzles cannot be solved in the “usual” way.</p><p>It looks retro, yet feels brand new—an innovative puzzle RPG born from the fusion of retro style and quantum-inspired mechanics.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cassette-boy-adds-xbox-series-ps4-and-xbox-one-versions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A demo of <em>Itachi: Haunted Abodes – Wandering Through 2000s Tokyo Culture</em> will be playable at the room6 booth at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which will run from September 25 to 28 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. Stickers will also be distributed to those who add the game to their wishlist.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Itachi: Hunted Abodes</em> is a paranormal suspense adventure that has you wandering through 2000s Tokyo’s subculture scenes!</p><p><strong>A Paranormal Subculture Story Starting with a Stigmatized Property</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to early 2000s Tokyo.</p><p>Meet Itachi, a college student without a place to stay. He finds a part-time job that provides him a house… specifically, a stigmatized property. That is, a house with a dark past.</p><p>No experience is needed, all expenses are paid for, and all that’s required of him is to live in the house, normally, for a week. And he gets paid quite well for it, too.</p><p>The only slightly annoying thing is that he has to live with Tanuki, an employee from the real estate company giving him this job.</p><p>Well, there’s one more “slightly annoying” thing. What he doesn’t know is that he was actually hired to be a lure for “Landgods,” a type of spectre haunting the houses of those who died away from their hometown.</p><p>The idea is to drive these Landgods away so that the house can be sold safely… regardless of what happens to Itachi in the process.</p><p>Join “weasel” Itachi and “raccoon dog” Tanuki in this adventure through Tokyo’s subculture scenes.</p><p>Your own job? Finding clues on the previous tenant’s untimely death.</p><p><strong>Two Opposite Perspectives</strong></p><p>During the investigation parts, you’ll be able to switch between Itachi’s and Tanuki’s points of view. Itachi is just a normal human being who can’t even see the Landgods, but he’s great at talking to people. Band followers, girls in maid costumes—he could make anyone spill the beans.</p><p>Tanuki’s not so good with people, but he can see the Landgods. He can stop their attacks to collect information directly from them.</p><p>Only by combining these two opposite perspectives will you be able to see the whole truth.</p><p>Itachi’s job is to live in that creepy apartment, but he won’t be spending the whole day there. Go on a trip through Tokyo, looking for hints in the most disparate subculture scenes.</p><p>Live music clubs with visual-kei bands? Check.</p><p>Maid cafés where everything is cutesy to a fault? Check.</p><p>Harajuku and its frilly, over-the-top fashion? Check.</p><p>Go back in history, explore these unique 2000s scenes, and you might find the dark secrets you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Send Those Monsters Back to Their Land</strong></p><p>Once you have enough information, Tanuki can start a ritual to exorcise the Landgods back to where they came from.</p><p>You’ll need to show them that you know who they are: their name, their place of origin, and the cause of death of the person they followed to this house.</p><p>Use all the information you have to complete the ritual, but be careful… If you make too many mistakes, Itachi is the one who’ll pay for it.</p><p><strong>The Abodes You’ll Visit</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sudden Bassist Death Syndrome</strong> – What do the visual-kei groupies know?</li><li><strong>A Maid Made to Die</strong> – Not all of this maid’s secrets were so cute.</li><li><strong>Workaholics Anonymous</strong> – Why work when you can play dress up in Harajuku?</li><li><strong>Baggage From Home</strong> – Uncover an old grudge with the goths’ help.</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/paranormal-suspense-adventure-game-itachi-haunted-abodes-wandering-through-2000s-tokyo-culture-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
