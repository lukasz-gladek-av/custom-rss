            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A dark visual novel created by the team behind <em>NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD</em>. Overly sensitive to other people’s emotions, the protagonist—a light novel writer—develops the ability to read minds, only to be driven even deeper into isolation. His sole remaining comfort is his younger sister, gifted yet lonely.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>“Onii-chan, you really are a lonely person.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“Did you lose faith in me?”</p><p>“No. I love you, onii-chan.”</p><p>Unable to bear the ugliness of the world and terrified of other people, the protagonist develops the ability to read minds.</p><p>He shuts himself away and submits a light novel he wrote, which unexpectedly wins a newcomer’s award. But the jealousy and envy that follow only deepen his distrust of the few human relationships he still has. Those around him hurt his fragile heart without even realizing it.</p><p>His only remaining comfort is his younger sister, who lives with him.</p><p>Clinging to each other just to stay alive, the two sink night after night into a twisted, unhealthy codependency.</p><p><em>—I keep living alone, talking about my own prejudices and cursing the world. Day after day.<br>I ripped off Dostoevsky, half-assed it into something modern, and turned it into a light-novels.<br>I mean, I tried. In my own stupid way.<br>Had the heroines talk about “existentialism” like it was supposed to mean something.</em></p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>The gameplay is an old-school, straight-up classic visual novel. The text fills the entire screen, so read as much as you want—or just right-click to hide it and enjoy the art. That’s it. Read, click, and vibe.</p><p>Live through a gloomy, suffocating real world through an overly sensitive protagonist… then come home and savor the only happiness left in his life: the time he spends with his little sister, his one true comfort.</p><p>As the friction with the people around you keeps piling up, there’ll be moments when their petty thoughts make you feel actual murderous rage. And in those moments, you can use your mind-reading ability to drive them to suicide.</p><p>That snide bastard. That arrogant asshole. Hit them right where it hurts—right in the deep-seated insecurities they never want anyone to see—and take them out. It’s not like you’re killing them with your own hands, so you won’t get caught. The ones truly at fault are the tasteless, mindless conformists who do nothing but obey society without a shred of aesthetic sense.</p><p>…But is that really okay?</p><p>What is happiness, anyway?</p><p>And in the end—what kind of future will the protagonist and his sister walk into?</p><p>Witness it with your own eyes.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scenario and Director:</strong> nyalra</li><li><strong>Artwork:</strong> Ohisashiburi</li><li><strong>Music:</strong> Aiobahn +81</li><li><strong>User Interface Design:</strong> Maruino</li><li><strong>Programming:</strong> HAYAO</li></ul></div><p>Watch the first footage below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/needy-streamer-overload-creators-announce-dark-visual-novel-sister-other-paranoia-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
