It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453490/Rootbound/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026. <span id="more-948942"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453490/Rootbound/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A physics-based action adventure about a plantling’s quest to save its home from a mysterious blight. Equipped with your sentient backpack, you venture into a broken world. Meet lost souls, solve ancient puzzles, fight dangerous monsters, and uncover the secrets of a long-forgotten civilization.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_948948"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Explore the World</strong> – Every corner of the handcrafted island of <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>ra is filled with secrets and activities. Learn what happened to the ancient civilization that once ruled the land, and make use of their lost technology. Solve puzzles to obtain powerful weapons and valuable upgrades—they will prove useful for the challenges that lie ahead.</li><li><strong>A Living Backpack</strong> – Your backpack is much more than a simple storage for items and materials. As a sentient, but silent companion, it has a mind of its own and aids you on your journey by collecting items and tossing them to you when needed—that is, if it’s in the mood. But be careful: enemies might notice its living nature and turn their attacks on it.</li><li><strong>Brighten Your Path</strong> – Crystals can be found everywhere on Akara and are essential to build campfires and torches. Campfires allow you to rest, recover, and use gathered materials to prepare for the challenges ahead. Torches shine light in dark and unexplored areas and are even rumored to give you helpful magical powers.</li><li><strong>Beware the Rain</strong> – When traveling through the night unprotected, the rain will come—said to be the source of the mysterious blight plaguing your home. Only the light of torches and campfires can shield you from its touch. Continuing through the rain is unwise and dangerous.</li><li><strong>Survive the Void</strong> – During your travels, you’ll encounter dangerous enemies and mysterious characters who have found ways to endure the vile rain. Yet, many of the friendlier ones would surely accept the help of a resourceful traveler like you. Speak with them and decide for yourself if their cause is worth your time and support.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
