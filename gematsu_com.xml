Each character boasts a unique skillset to challenge players to master different gameplay styles. Battle the hordes of the underworld on an assortment of playable maps drawing from various locales from the mythological story of Achilles such as Troy and Tartarus. Level up your character during each run to elevate them from hero to god of destruction as you gain stronger power-ups and abilities. Increase overall team stats between runs to increase your odds of winning the fight against Hades’ minions as you confront more lethal monsters and bosses.</p><p>Following the Trojan War, Hades, the god of the underworld, resurrected Achilles to use him in a conflict against the other gods. Once Achilles had served his purpose, Hades betrayed him, casting him into the depths of Tartarus and condemning him to eternal torment. Refusing to accept this fate, Achilles broke free from the underworld, rescuing many lost souls, including several who had fallen to his own sword. Angered by this defiance, Hades unleashed his dark minions to hunt down Achilles and all the souls he freed. Take on the mantle of Achilles or one of the many others rescued from Tartarus and prepare for a fight that will take you beyond the land of the living in the hopes of thwarting Hades and his army of the damned.</p><!-- AD: content -->

    <p><span>New evidence types, streamlined user interface and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Kinetic Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> will release the “Chronicle” update for the Early Access release of four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [271 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> psychological <a title="Genres > Horror [622 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Phasmophobia [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a></em> on June 24, the developer announced. <span id="more-968084"></span></p><p>Described as the game’s “biggest update yet,” the update will introduce a complete overhaul of evidence collection, expanding investigations with three new evidence types—including the new Sound evidence, the three-tiered Sound Recorder—a completely redesigned Journal, reworked leveling and progression, a refreshed main menu interface, and “many eerie surprises.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Equipment: Introducing the Sound Recorder</strong></p><p>At the heart of the “Chronicle” update is the chilling debut of Sound evidence, a new haunting paranormal proof type captured through the new Sound Recorder. This fresh mechanic will add a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams. Available in three upgrade tiers (T1, T2, and T3), this new equipment unlocks deeper layers of audio detection, as players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p><p><strong>Journal Overhaul</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “Chronicle” update will redefine how ghost hunters gather evidence. The journal will get a full redesign, where the Photos tab will be replaced by a brand-new Media tab. This tab will organize all captured proof into three sections—Photos, Videos, and new Sound Recordings—offering a richer, more immersive investigation experience where players can log photographic, visual, and new haunting audio evidence all in one place. Investigators will now need to fill a full book of unique media to complete a perfect investigation, with new paranormal moments to capture—from EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Redesigned Evidence System</strong></p><p>“Chronicle” will also introduce a revamped media quality system. The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as “Unique”, granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as “Duplicates”, offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts.</p><p><strong>…And More!</strong></p><p>In addition to the evidence collection overhaul, Sound Recorder, and revamped media quality system, the “Chronicle” update will introduce a reworked levelling and progression system, and a brand-new Main Menu user interface. Behind the scenes, the <em>Phasmophobia</em> team has also been hard at work exorcising bugs to polish the experience for players—and there are still plenty of secrets waiting to be uncovered when the update drops.</p><p>This year, <em>Phasmophobia</em> will also see the highly-anticipated rework to Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse’s recent overhaul. Grafton, an abandoned, crumbling home, will soon feature updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic. The revamped Grafton Farmhouse arrives after “Chronicle”—stay tuned for release details!</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [235 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,259 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
