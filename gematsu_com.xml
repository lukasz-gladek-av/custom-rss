Perform heroic deeds, defeat perilous foes, and embark on epic quests. Your triumphs shall earn you new epithets—heroic names of great power. But beware, for fame is a sword that cuts both ways.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kromlech - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKfOWmNdO20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/action-adventure-rpg-kromlech-launches-in-early-access-on-march-5]]></content:encoded>
