    <p><span>Join forces with Saber and Archer in the Fate/stay night collaboration.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “For the Sun is Set to Die,” will launch on July 2, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [198 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-975048"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Phainon and the Trailblazer will stand together at the crossroads of destiny, ready to take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova. At the same time, three new playable characters—Phainon, Saber, and Archer—will make their long-awaited debut. Each brings a unique background and combat style to the battlefield, adding new depth and flair to this epic journey. Across the version, a slate of limited-time events, feature optimizations, and fresh content promises to challenge expectations and stir excitement in every corner of the galaxy.</p><p>Picking up where the story left off, the Chrysos Heirs gave everything they had, <a title="Genres > Racing [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> against time to help the Trailblazer and Phainon return the final Coreflame to the Vortex of Genesis. As the veils shrouding Amphoreus begin to lift, one truth becomes undeniable: things were never as simple as they seemed. What unfolds next reaches far beyond a single world—the dawn of the Era Nova may echo across the stars. And in the wake of it all, the Trailblazer’s choices could shape the very destiny of the universe itself.</p><p>In the upcoming main story, the long-awaited Phainon will finally join the Trailblazer’s team as a key ally. Born in Aedes Elysiae, he was among the first Chrysos Heirs to extend goodwill to the Trailblazer upon their arrival in Amphoreus. In the face of ever-mounting danger, he has repeatedly stepped forward to shield others from the storm. Behind his calm and reliable demeanor, however, lies the burden of great expectations. In Version 3.4, players will venture deep into Aedes Elysiae alongside the Trailblazer, tracing Phainon’s journey—from his rise as a warrior, to joining the Flame-Chase, and ultimately becoming the person he is today. During combat, Phainon can accumulate “Coreflames” through various means. Once he reaches a certain number of “Coreflames,” he can unleash his Ultimate to transform and create a “Territory,” battling enemies in a powerful new form. His combat power greatly increases. While transformed, allies temporarily leave the battlefield, but their bonus effects remain active. Upon transforming using Coreflames, Phainon unlocks new abilities, channeling the powers of Origination, Calamity, and the Foundation Titans. It’s worth mentioning that when Phainon is in the team, the team’s Technique Point cap increases. His Technique can instantly defeat normal enemies within a certain range without triggering combat. This will make exploring the map and adventuring across worlds much easier.</p><p>Beyond Amphoreus, Penacony too shall unfold its magnificent story: Recently, Trailblazer received a mysterious letter from Old Oti, head of the Alfalfa Family, an invitation to join a special entertainment program called “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War.” This Holy Grail War will take place in Penacony, where seven invited participants will summon Penacony’s historical figures as Servants to fight alongside them. In addition to the Trailblazer, familiar names like Aventurine, Mr. Boothill, and Miss Robin will also appear as contestants. At the same time, three legendary Heroic Spirits will respond to the Holy Grail’s call: Saber, Archer, and Lancer. How will this dazzling and unpredictable “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War” unfold? Who will form a contract with whom? The Trailblazer can uncover all these mysteries firsthand. The <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> × <em><a title="Series > Fate [67 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]</em> collaboration special story—Trailblaze Continuance “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail” and the event “Fate/stay night” will officially go live on July 11. Stay tuned!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_975052"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>It is also worth noting that Saber will be joining as a playable character in this collaboration. Saber is a 5-star Wind-type character following the Path of Destruction. Her Ultimate, “Excalibur,” deals massive Wind DMG to all enemies and converts her Basic ATK into an enhanced Basic ATK that also targets all enemies. During combat, Saber can accumulate “Core Resonance” through her Technique, Basic ATKs, or when allies use their Ultimates. Once she accumulates enough, she will immediately gain an extra action. Using her Skill at this moment consumes all accumulated “Core Resonance,” increases the Skill’s damage, and instantly refills the Energy required for her Ultimate.</p><p>At the same time, Archer will also be available as a playable character to assist players in battling powerful enemies during the Holy Grail War and the subsequent cosmic adventures. Archer is a Quantum-type character following the Path of the Hunt, skilled at dealing sustained single-target damage through repeated Skill use. When his Skill is activated and he enters the “Circuit Connection” state, casting the Skill will not end his turn. He can continue to use it until all Skill Points are depleted. With each additional cast, the damage increases accordingly. Upon using his Ultimate, Archer will recite the classic chant to activate “Unlimited Blade Works,” unleashing a powerful strike against a single enemy and gaining Special Charge. As the battle continues, whenever an ally attacks, Archer can consume this Charge to trigger a Follow-up ATK and restore 1 Skill Point for the team.</p><p>Starting from July 11, once the collaboration event begins and until the end of Version 3.6, Trailblazers who log in will be able to claim Archer, the limited 5-star collaboration character, for free. It’s worth mentioning here that the character and Light Cone collab banners will be available long-term after the event starts.</p><p>Version 3.4 brings not only the return of many popular characters, but also all-anticipated enhancements and stunning new looks for familiar faces. In the first half of the update, limited 5-star characters Tribbie, Sunday, and Sparkle will return for a limited time. In the second half, Firefly, Jingliu, and Blade will return as well. Even more excitingly, Silver Wolf, Blade, Kafka, and Jingliu will receive substantial enhancements, including adjustments to battle mechanics and Eidolon effects. Notably, players will also be able to freely switch between classic and enhanced combat modes, allowing for flexible gameplay tailored to individual preferences and playstyles. Additionally, Firefly’s brand-new outfit, Spring Missive, will make its debut in this update, bringing a fresh look to this beloved Stellaron Hunter.</p><p>And that’s not all. The long-awaited “skip dialogue” feature, which was previously announced, is finally going live in Version 3.4, letting players freely choose the pace of storytelling based on their own preferences. The all-familiar minigame “Origami Bird” will make a strong comeback, adding a touch of lively fun to the update.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,778 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.
