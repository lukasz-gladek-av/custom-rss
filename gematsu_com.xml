Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p><p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p><p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p><p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p><p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p><p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Fixes to Player Controls<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie <a title="Companies > Dodge Roll [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/dodge-roll">Dodge Roll</a> from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li></ul></li><li>Fixes to Multiplayer<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/splatoon-3-version-11-0-0-update-launches-january-29]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Welcome to the hallowed halls of <em>KILLER INN</em>. You have been chosen as one of the select few to participate in a one-night-only game of death, deceit, and deduction.</p><p>Will you be given the role of a wolf, to hunt among the shadows? Or will you be a lamb, but with the ability and means to fight back?</p><p>Trust no one. <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> everything. The killers are hiding in plain sight—and they might just be your closest “allies.”</p><p>In deception we trust.</p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Asymmetric [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/asymmetric">Asymmetric</a>al x Murder <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery x Action Game</strong></p><p>Who is a wolf…?</p><p>24 of you will take part in this one-night-only murder mystery game. Some of you will take on the role of wolves, while the rest play as lambs.</p><p>Wolves must disguise themselves amongst the lambs, hiding their true nature as they wait for the right moment to strike. But do not fret dear lambs, the numbers favor your side.</p><p>It will be chaotic, you will suspect your neighbors, and there will be white-knuckled battles drenched in blood. And we can guarantee that you will have the time of your lives, for however long remains of it.</p><p><strong>Clues Will Lead You to the Truth</strong></p><p>Every <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e scene contains clues: hair, fingerprints, blood, clothing…</p><p>Who do the clues point to? The more clues you gather, the more you can narrow down who the culprit is.</p><p><strong>The Rules</strong></p><p>Winning is simple: eliminate the opposing team!</p><p>It’s a life-or-death battle between the wolves and lambs. Who will reign supreme? The lambs, with numbers on their side, or the wolves, whose identities are unknown and can hide among the flock?</p><p>However, the cleverest of lambs have another path to victory: escape.</p><p>Can you flee the castle? All you must do is secure keys to the harbor gate and raise the anchors. Easy, right? But can you truly trust everyone working alongside you?</p><p><strong>Fight to Survive</strong></p><p>Forget voting and finger-pointing. Once you’ve found the killer, it’s time to fight. If you’re strong or clever, you’ll survive. If not? You’re just another corpse in a hallway.</p><p><strong>Kill However You Like</strong></p><p>An array of items are hidden in the castle:</p><ul><li>Guns and melee weapons to give yourself a fighting chance.</li><li>Traps and poisons perfect for murder.</li><li>Armor and gas masks to protect oneself.</li></ul><p>There’s no one sure-fire strategy. Your path to victory is shaped by your playstyle.</p><p><strong>Focus Mode</strong></p><p>Sharpen your senses and feel your surroundings come alive. Focus Mode lets you detect a killer’s footprints, bullet casings and glass fragments, or even sounds through walls.</p><p><strong>Immersive Voice Chat With 3D Audio</strong></p><p>Want to talk in private? Step into a room and close the door. KILLER INN uses 3D audio voice chat that takes into account players’ locations, distance between them, and the space around them. Not a fan of voice chat? You can also communicate using a wide range of emotes and stamps.</p><p><strong>Unique Characters, Endless Strategies</strong></p><p>Who do you want to be? Reinvent yourself by adopting whichever persona you like. Each character has their own unique abilities. They can be silent movers, master sleuths, or even expert thieves. Use their skills to shape your strategy and turn the tide.</p><p><strong>Play Solo, or in a Duo, Trio, or Squad!</strong></p><p>Whether you roll solo or bring a crew, the ultimate game is waiting for you. Form a skilled squad of detectives, or become a cunning pack of wolves. You can stay in sync with your party members through voice chat even when they’re not in close proximity.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="KILLER INN | Steam Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYhql6wyyTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『KILLER INN』（キラーイン）「Steam®早期アクセス」アナウンスメントトレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dBLA6uEWBMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/killer-inn-launches-in-early-access-on-february-12]]></content:encoded>
