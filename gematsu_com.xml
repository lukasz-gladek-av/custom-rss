        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Under the rule of two great kingdoms, the continent of Maygard once enjoyed a period of prosperity.</p><p>However, that prosperity became a thing of the past once the continent came under attack from the Demon King Hamehameha and her formidable magical power… Since then, humanity has gradually been losing ground to the Demon King’s forces.</p><p>With the survival of humanity at stake, a Hero arises to defeat the Demon King. Heading on a journey together with new allies and two princesses with whom he overcame a sage’s trials, the Hero seeks to obtain a sacred relic which is said to vanquish demons.</p><p>However, the Hero and his party meet an untimely demise when they encounter a surprise-attack by the Demon King. With humanity’s last hope lost, it seemed like the world was all but in the hands of the Demon Lord…</p><p>In his fading state of consciousness, the Hero extends his arm towards his captured party members. In that moment, the Hero hears a voice pleading for help somewhere deep in the darkness.</p><p>“Someone please help me…”</p><p>Drawn to the voice, the Hero’s spirit is summoned by Julietta, a princess from a faraway land being held prisoner in the Demon King’s castle. The two quickly figure out that Julietta’s desire to escape and the Hero’s desire to rescue his party members are aligned with one another.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_925090"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Julietta</strong> (voiced by Moe Toyota) – A mysterious princess the Hero meets in the Demon Castle. Uses summoning magic to summon the hero Hero to aid her escape from the Demon Castle. According to herself, the princess of a small and isolated island kingdom off the coast of the continent of Maygard. Having had very little contact with others, she has long dreamed of making friends. Because of this background, while Julietta rarely initiates conversation she always makes sure to properly answer when someone speaks to her, even if in an awkward manner. While she may be an introvert, that does not mean she is bad at communicating.</li><li><strong>Aria</strong> (voiced by Mao Amatsuka) – The princess of Aria Zaza, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. Having led a sheltered childhood, Aria has been insulated from most knowledge of the real world. While soft-spoken, she harbors a deep desire for a peaceful world in which everyone can live happily. While prone to making ditzy remarks, Aria posesses a gifted mind and sometimes surprises those around her with her logical arguments and astute oberservations. She is also exceptionally well-trained in magic. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Zena</strong> (voiced by Fumiko Uchimura) – The princess of Zanji Zard, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. She trains in swordsmanship daily and her skills are second-to-none! Being afraid of nobody and lacking restraint, she may flip between insulting the Hero in one moment and joking around with him the next. Says this and that, but in the end finds herself drawn to the Hero. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Charlotte</strong> (voiced by Yuki Tanaka) – A stern female knight who swore her allegiance to Aria. A leader-like figure to the group, always troubled by the other girls’ freewheeling <a title="Genres > Action [2,283 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. A keen and observant person, Charlotte understands the strengths and weaknesses of each party member and is able to give out orders appropriate to the situation, displaying her talent as a commander. While calm, collected, and able to be relied on most of the time, when Charlotte loses control of her emotions she loses sight of her surroundings, often repeating the phrase “Ugh, kill me!”</li><li><strong>Finanche</strong> (voiced by Honoka Inoue) – A mage from the kingdom of Aria Zaza. An apprentice to the sage who previously accompanied the Hero on his journey. Having lost her parents at a young age, Finanche was raised by the sage in their stead. To Finanche, the sage is both her master and a parental figure. In order to pay back the sage for having raised her, Finanche studied hard to become a skilled mage. Because of this past, she blames the Hero for the death of the sage and looks down on him as lacking in ability.</li><li><strong>Chouquette</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Mano) – A dark <a title="Companies > elf [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/elf">elf</a> and former bandit who now serves Aria. Becoming a bandit in order to provide for her kind, hated and looked down upon by the citizens of Aria Zaza, Chouquette was apprehended by Charlotte and became a prisoner awaiting execution. However, Aria, upon hearing the struggles of Chouquette and the dark elves, extended her support to them and spared Chouquette’s life on the condition that she become Aria’s personal guard. Moved by Aria’s open-heartedness, Chouquette pledged her loyalty to Aria.</li><li><strong>Demon King Hamehameha</strong> (voiced by Mikoi Sasaki) – The Demon King that reigns over the Maygard Continent. The very culprit that screwed the Hero’s party in the Demon Castle. Cold, calculative, and condescending towards human life, she has no reservations about killing. In addition, she wields powerful magic thanks to her massive magical power.</li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Guide the Princesses to Escape From the Demon Castle!</strong> – Since you, the hero, have no physical body, you cannot search for or solve traps on your own. Instead, you must guide the captured princesses to uncover the castle’s many puzzles, rescue your party members, and escape! Depending on your choices, the fates of the princesses could change dramatically!</li><li><strong>Use the Hints and Items You Find to Solve the Castle’s Many Puzzles!</strong> – You’ll need to deal with a plethora of traps and puzzles to free the princesses from the Demon Castle. To solve them all, search each room corner-to-corner to collect items and hints! As the hero, your wits and resourcefulness will be tested!</li><li><strong>Rescue the Members of the Hero’s <a title="Genres > Party [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Who Have Been Screwed!</strong> – At the hands of Demon King Hamehameha, who loves to screw others more than anything in the world, the Hero’s Party have been taken away to the Demon Castle and strewn screwn all over the castle, crying out for help! Try not to be distracted by the unbecoming positions your allies have been placed in, and search for items and hints to rescue them as soon as possible. Suppress your urge to stare at the maidens before you, and fulfill your duty as a Hero to rescue your friends and save the world!</li><li><strong>No Need to Worry About Channel Bans (or Your Mom Walking in)! a Curtain of Light to Protect the Girls’ Precious Parts!</strong> – The configurations menu now boasts “Sensitive Mode,” which you can turn on to have a curtain of light cover up your party members’ precious parts! This mode can be toggled on and off at any time, even during exploration, from the config menu. With this mode active, you won’t have to worry about your streaming, video sharing, or social media accounts getting banned! Plus, you can now play in the living room without having to worry about mom walking in!</li></ul><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> Waon Inui, MIZU</li><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Linkedbrain Inc.</li><li><strong>Producer:</strong> Yujiro Usuda</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a set of videos below.

You’ll also receive recommendations based on your Nintendo Switch Play Activity! More music will continue to be added to the app, so be sure to keep an ear out.</p><p>Reliving your musical memories from across Nintendo franchises—including <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, <em>Pikmin</em>, <em>Metroid</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and more—is now just a tap away!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of Japanese commercials below.
