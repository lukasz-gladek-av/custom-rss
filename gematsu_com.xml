Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_952790"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,635 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,603 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.

Only the strongest will claim the top rank, and those who reach Rank A may even have one in-game wish granted. As players navigate the competition, they’ll encounter other competitors and friends who will test their skills, like either Urbain or Taunie.</p><p>During the day, Trainers can explore wild zones to catch and train Pokémon in preparation for upcoming battles at night. When the battle zone becomes active, timing and strategy are key as landing a surprise attack can provide a critical advantage and escaping higher-ranked opponents may sometimes be necessary. To succeed in the Z-A Royale, players must make the most of both day and night, strengthening their teams for any challenges that await in Lumiose City.</p></blockquote><p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> in late 2025.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.
