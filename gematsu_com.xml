Players must utilize cooperation between the protagonist and his companions, as well as powerful special moves, to take on formidable foes. Assess the rapidly changing state of battle, quickly select skills, and gain the upper hand.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_026.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_027.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Genome Arms</strong></p><p>“Genome Arms” are mutated arms that transform into weapons. By changing equipped skills, players can adopt a variety of combat styles. Additionally, the protagonist’s Genome Arms can be switched during battle—by considering enemy affinities and coordination with companions, players can gain a strategic advantage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_028.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_029.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Wall Slide</strong></p><p>When you approach a wall, a wall slide will begin, allowing you to quickly move along the wall to the opposite side of the field. Outside of swift movement, it can also be used to launch a surprise “raid attack” on enemies from above. Raid attacks make it easier to fight off enemies, allowing you to aim for a quick victory.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Warning Signal</strong></p><p>When an enemy is about to attack, a warning signal will shine. By swapping Genome Arms at the right moment in response to the signal, you can parry the enemy’s attack. This prevents damage and enables a strong “deflect counter” right after. There are also counters that can be used by successfully dodging at the right moment, and counters that allow you to blow back after being sent flying by the enemy’s attack. <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter these various counters to respond to the enemy’s attack in any situation.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_034.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editions</strong></p><p><strong>Standard Edition</strong> (8,580 yen on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>; 9,680 yen on <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li></ul><p><strong>Special Edition</strong> (17,380 yen on PlayStation 5 and Switch; 18,480 yen on Switch 2)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_044.jpg"></a></figure><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Visual art book</li><li>Digipack soundtrack CD</li><li>Wide-color-gamut art prints (x2)</li><li>Lottery ticket application card for an extra large (727mm x 606mm) canvas board (10 winners will be selected)</li></ul><p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition</strong> (10,780 yen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch; 11,880 yen on Switch 2)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Digital visual book</li></ul></div><p><em>Villion: Code</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, and Switch on May 25 in Japan.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

With a vibrant aesthetic that aims to recreate the richness and dynamism of hand-drawn Japanese animation, <em>Homura Hime</em> tasks players with ridding the world of the fiendish Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, utilizing slick melee combat evocative of the <em><a title="Series > NieR [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/nier">NieR</a></em> and <em>Devil May Cry</em> series. Dodge the barrages of enemy attacks and string together flashy combos to clear the battlefield, excising tainted souls from a troubled world and unraveling the mysterious legacy of the titular heroine.</p><p>Welcome to a world populated by both humans and demons. Here, troubled souls burdened by intense emotion or deep regret are transformed into archdemons when they pass through the veil of mortality. These archdemons have the power to corrupt the very foundation of the world, contaminating their surroundings and the creatures who dwell within them. Those tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters; vicious fiends that operate solely on raw instinct. When this world becomes threatened by a quintet of extremely powerful Archdemon Girls, the High Priestess has no other choice but to turn to Homura Hime, the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist. Alongside her devoted aide Ann, Homura Hime must embark on a divine mission to eliminate the five Archdemon Girls and their monster hordes, banishing their evil and purifying her discordant world.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022093"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
