    <p><span>Elena dances her way across the grasslands.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,580 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released the gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Elena, who is due out on June 5 alongside the launch of its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/street-fighter-6-coming-to-switch-2-on-june-5-alongside-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Switch 2 version and Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>. <span id="more-961234"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>As a returning fan favorite of the series, players’ spirits will rise for Elena as she brings her unique moveset inspired by capoeira, a Brazilian martial art and dance form that blends martial arts, dance, music and acrobatics combined with the modern touches of <em>Street Fighter 6</em> mechanics. Elena also brings a brand new stage, Reniala Remains, which showcases the plains of Africa at night as wildlife roam in the background, all lit by the glowing <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a> above. Players will need to keep up with Elena as she dances across all three game modes including World Tour, Fighting Ground, and Battle Hub.</p><p>The pure-spirited Elena showcases her kicker moves with two colorful Outfits. Outfit 1 is themed around her newest look, creating a fresh yet familiar style that emphasizes both her grace and physique, while Outfit 2 is an ode to her iconic look in <em>Street Fighter III: New Generation</em> and <em>Ultra Street Fighter IV</em>. Outfit 2 can be acquired by maxing out your bond with her in World Tour or via Fighter Coins.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961245"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Elena’s moveset uses her long legs and unpredictable movements to keep her prey in check, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rhino Horn</strong> – A series of quick, forward-moving kicks that send the opponent flying back</li><li><strong>Scratch Wheel</strong> – Known as Elena’s “dragon-punch,” this move is useful for anti-airs or for keeping opponents away</li><li><strong>Lynx Song</strong> – Where things get wild, Elena spins forward close to the ground while invincible to projectiles and can then use four different techniques out of it, such as Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash or Lynx Whirl.<ul><li><strong>Leopard Snap</strong> – A long-reaching attack useful for closing distances</li><li><strong>Harvest Circle</strong> -: A kick that launches opponents in the air and maintains invincibility to projectiles</li><li><strong>Mallet Smash</strong> – An overhead kick that can buffalow-profile</li><li><strong>Lynx Whirl</strong> – Elena performs an additional spin to extend Lynx Song. If the aforementioned Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, or Mallet Smash are performed after Lynx Whirl, their properties are “boosted!”</li></ul></li><li><strong>Spinning Scythe</strong> – As seen in previous iterations, perform a series of spinning kicks that can be canceled and followed up with Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash, and Lynx Whirl, to keep up the pressure on her opponents</li><li><strong>Moon Glider</strong> – An evasive technique where Elena steps back before performing a vertical spinning kick that sends the opponent in the air</li><li><strong>Meteor Volley</strong> – Elena’s Level 1 Super Art that operates as an effective anti-air move and also allows for a follow-up attack.</li><li><strong>Revival Dance</strong> – Elena’s Level 2 Super Art where she launches forward with a flurry of kicks and is invincible to all attacks on start-up. If you hold the down button, rather than dealing extra damage, Elena will do her trademark healing!</li><li><strong>Song of the Grasslands</strong> – Elena’s Level 3 Super Art brings the power of nature to the fight as she delivers kicks with the power of the skies and plains!</li></ul><p>Finally, a major balance patch will come to <em>Street Fighter 6</em> when Elena launches, introducing changes for all of the previous 25 characters along with some broader system changes as well. Keep an eye out for the detailed patch notes as we head toward Elena’s launch!</p></blockquote><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> vis <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.
