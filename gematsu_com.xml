The thugs are reminiscent of the villain characters in <em>Fist of the North Star</em>, and the finger-press sound is reminiscent of the pressure-point sound used in the anime. The mysterious character’s leg and arm also match the design of Kenshiro, the protagonist of <em>Fist of the North Star</em>.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fatal-Fury-CotW-Fatal-Fury-Tease_01-08-26_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fatal-Fury-CotW-Fatal-Fury-Tease_01-08-26_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fatal-Fury-CotW-Fatal-Fury-Tease_01-08-26_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>SNK has previously posted similar animated teasers featuring Wolfgang Krauser (in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaUMnyGCO6I" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsdIXI58d60" target="_blank">Japanese</a>), as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKsUvkBLG4" target="_blank">Mr. Karate and Robert Garcia</a>, so it is possible these animated trailers are intended to tease new downloadable characters for Season 2, which <a href="https://twitter.com/FATALFURY_PR/status/2006379897342628207" target="_blank">begins in January</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Assemble your team from a diverse set of characters and test your skills against yōkai and steampunk contraptions. Carve your own path through an immersive story and change the very fate of the Empire.</p><p>Step into 1868 Japan, a land fiercely divided by a brutal civil war between the traditionalist forces of Shogun Tokugawa and the technologically superior army of Emperor Mutsuhito, backed by the British East Nippon Company. Amidst this turmoil, warriors, spies, and mystical beings navigate a world where magic and machinery intertwine, the jarring contrast of tradition and technology permeating even the landscape, where weathered, ancient temples stand alongside towering steam-powered machines. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a country at a pivotal crossroads, torn between its cherished ancient heritage and the relentless march of modernization.

Throughout their arduous journey, new heroes will join their cause, each with their own past and motivations. Together, they will confront tremendous and ever-growing dangers, striving to reclaim their honor and change the course of history. Every choice you make will guide your characters along unique and captivating paths: form new bonds, sever lifelong friendships, or mend fractured family ties. Your decisions will shape who they become.</p><p><strong>Different Characters</strong></p><p>Take on the role of master strategist as you guide your band of warriors in both combat and conscience. Each character has a variety of backgrounds and skills, as well as their own motivations, desires, and fears… Build a team that compliments your preferred tactics and your personality.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>Experience classic, turn-based combat with a samurai-tactics flare. Each team member brings their own distinctive set of skills and abilities to the battlefield. Even their personal goals and relationships influence every encounter. If you can master these social and strategic dynamics, then you and your team will no doubt dominate the battlefield.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>East Nippon Company Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="2026 Release Trailer — East Nippon Company" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6FJh-7IQ84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/shadow-of-the-road-launches-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

A physical edition of the game will also be distributed by <a title="Companies > Maximum Entertainment [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/maximum-entertainment">Maximum Entertainment</a> across North America, Europe, and Australia. <span id="more-1018338"></span></p><p>“This is my first time working on a video game, and I loved the way that [the <em>Aphelion</em> team] thought about the music and about the game,” Bouhafa said in a press release. “I’m enjoying the experience.”</p><p>DON’T NOD creative director Florent Guillaume added, “It has been a real pleasure to collaborate with Amine on Aphelion. We discovered his work through his composition for The Summit of the Gods and were immediately captivated by his talent for portraying the intimacy of characters caught up in a grand, epic adventure. Amine is a person with great emotional intelligence and sincere humanity. I hope that players will feel that connection and will be moved by their experience.”</p><p>Here are the latest details, via DON’T NOD:</p><blockquote><p>Amine Bouhafa is a Cesar award-winning French-Tunisian composer known for his scores on <em>Timbuktu</em> (2015), <em>The Summit of the Gods</em> (2021), and <em>The Little Sister</em> (2025). </p><p>Players will be able to experience Bouhafa’s unique blend of epic and intimate as it gives life to planet Persephone and supports Ariane and Thomas’s journeys in the game. His work easily and beautifully conveys the atmosphere and mood of the planet, the tension of the Nemesis, and the emotions between the characters. The video explores the ways in which Amine uses instruments such as the pipe organ and the unique cristal baschet in order to reflect the sacred feeling of the adventure, and to bring to life the frozen identity of Persephone</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
