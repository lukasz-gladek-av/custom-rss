            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/longdue-announces-psychological-rpg-hopetown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a title="Companies > Longdue [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/longdue">Longdue</a>, one of various studios <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/10/former-disco-elysium-developers-establish-longdue-to-develop-psychogeographic-rpg-spiritual-successor">established</a> by former <em>Disco Elysium</em>, has announced <em><a title="Games > Hopetown" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hopetown">Hopetown</a></em>, its psychological RPG spiritual successor to <em>Disco Elysium</em>. A crowdfunding campaign is planned, with a limited number of registrations for its pre-launch now available via the studio’s <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. <span id="more-939677"></span></p><p>“Having overseen the team of 15 that was credited with ‘saving’ <em>Disco Elysium</em> and which worked on it for nearly six years, pre- and post-release, I’m excited to work with the Longdue team to create a rich RPG experience to serve fans of the genre,” said contributor Piotr Sobolewsk in a press release.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p><p>Contributors include Piotr Sobolewsk, who previously oversaw pivotal contributions to the core systems that defined <em>Disco Elysium</em>. These groundbreaking mechanics, celebrated for their depth and ingenuity, reimagined how <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> handle narrative, choice, and player agency.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, Piotr is building on those foundations, applying the lessons learned from <em>Disco Elysium</em> to help the Longdue team craft bold, innovative designs at the heart of <em>Hopetown</em>—shaping a new vision for what narrative-driven RPGs can achieve.</p><p>In <em>Hopetown</em>, words are your deadliest weapon, and every choice leaves its mark. Set in a mining town caught between decay and transformation, shaped by ambition, exploitation, and the fragile systems that bind society together, you step into the role of a rogue journalist—a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel. Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels.</p><p><strong>A Town of Contrasts</strong></p><p>The town itself is an arena of extremes. The suffocating darkness of the mine’s depths mirrors the buried truths of its inhabitants, while the surface world—glittering with the promise of progress—is steeped in corruption and power plays. It’s a place where <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> depends on who controls the story, and where every decision ripples outward, reshaping not just the world, but yourself.</p><p><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong></p><p>Building on the legacies of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> introduces systems that redefine player agency. The psychogeography system transforms how players interact with the game world: emotions, memories, and conversations replace traditional mechanics like keys and levers, becoming the tools that unlock doors, alter landscapes, and reshape relationships. Progress isn’t just about solving puzzles or finding items—it’s about navigating the protagonist’s fractured psyche and the ripples it creates in the environment.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p><p><strong>A Crucible of Choices</strong></p><p>The mining town is more than a setting—it’s a crucible. What truths will you reveal? What lies will you tell? Will your words inspire hope or destruction? Will you reshape the systems of power, or will they consume you?</p><p><strong>Every Word Matters</strong></p><p>This is a game where everything transforms everything else. Every word you choose matters. Every decision carries weight. And every story you tell changes the world—and the fragile systems that hold it together.</p><p><strong>Why Back <em>Hopetown</em>?</strong></p><p>Backing Hopetown isn’t just about funding—it’s about building a community, backing a vision and casting a vote. Longdue is an independent studio daring to create the kinds of games bigger studios won’t or can’t make—games that challenge their players and let players challenge the games back. With Hopetown, Longdue is building a movement for <em>Disco Elysidum</em>-like narrative-driven RPGs that don’t shy away from complexity, emotion, or ambition.</p><p>Those who register in time for the pre-launch crowdfunding campaign via <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longdue’s website</a> will gain first access to a limited number of rewards that will be available privately shortly before the crowdfunding campaign goes public.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Contributors from <em>Disco Elysium</em></strong> – Seven people who worked on Disco Elysium across production, narrative and writing, world design, sound, audio, and technical design have contributed to <em>Hopetown</em> to date, bringing their expertise, learnings, and knowledge to this bold new project.</li><li><strong>An All-Star Team of RPG Talent</strong> – Supported by industry veterans with credits on <em><a title="Games > Cult of the Lamb [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a></em>, <em>The Witcher</em> universe, <em>Yes, Your Grace</em>, and more, Longdue is combining the raw creative energy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the best talent in the RPG space to deliver something truly extraordinary.</li><li><strong>A Spiritual <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [97 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>or</strong> – Drawing inspiration from the narrative depth of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and the philosophical complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> redefines what a psychological RPG can achieve.</li><li><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong> – Introducing innovative systems like psychogeography, where emotions and memories reshape the world, and a journalism RPG system, which empowers players to craft stories that influence perception, inspire rebellion, or enforce complacency.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Warner Bros. Games [641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> president David Hadddad will step down after 12 years of leading the company’s interactive entertainment division, the company announced. <span id="more-940031"></span></p><p>Haddad will stay on board with the company for the next three months as parent company Warner Bros. Discovery seeks his replacement and to help oversee the transition.</p><p>“David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title,” Warner Bros. Discovery global streaming and games CEO and president JB Perrette said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>Haddad commented, “I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.”</p><p>Here is the full internal note sent to staff from Perrette announcing Haddad’s exit:</p><blockquote><p>Global Games Team,</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I wanted to share with you the news that after 12 incredible years leading [Warner Bros. Discovery] Games, David Haddad has decided to depart the company.</p><p>On behalf of David Zaslav and all of us at WBD, I want to express my deepest gratitude to David for his phenomenal work and passion during his time here. With the support and incredible efforts of this whole team, David has led WB Games to numerous accomplishments over the years, both creatively and commercially. His vision, talent and passion have helped build one of the most successful and admired gaming companies in the industry and navigated some of the biggest changes and challenges as well.</p><p>From transitioning a physical software company into a digital-first gaming operation to organically building a successful <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [360 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> mobile business to developing and publishing multiple billion-dollar games and franchises—including <em><a title="Games > Hogwarts Legacy [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a></em>, <em>Game of Thrones Conquest</em>, and <em>Golf Clash</em>—to delighting more Mortal Kombat fans than any time in the franchise’s 30+ year history, the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title. David has also graciously agreed to stay on through the next three months as we kick-off a search to fill this important leadership role and will help ensure a smooth transition. This transition period will also provide me with additional opportunities to engage directly with the Games leadership, and I look forward to getting even more immersed with all of you and in this incredible business.</p><p>I fully appreciate that particularly after 12 years with the same leader and boss, change can be hard and uncomfortable (in our industry and at WBD we have certainly had our fair share). But it also brings opportunity, a chance for healthy new perspectives, and the ability to create the next incredible chapter for our fans and business… and I’m excited to embark on that with you.</p><p>I’m sure you have many questions due to this news, so David and I will be gathering with you at the scheduled Town Hall shortly. You may have more questions than we have answers right now, but we want to respond to what we can.</p><p>Thankfully we will have some more time to celebrate and thank David, but I know you’ll join me in this initial congratulations and thank you for this remarkable chapter he has led.</p><p>—JB</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
