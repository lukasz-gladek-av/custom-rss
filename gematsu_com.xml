Everything you do is monitored—from stealing, to vandalism, to being a menace to the local townsfolk.</li><li><strong>Judgment Is Inevitable</strong> – There will be moments where you’ll have to decide what kind of person you are—and the town responds accordingly. Maybe you can build goodwill through meaningful conversations and have the townsfolk assist you. Or perhaps you’re more likely to use people as pawns to achieve your goals. Either way, the town always remembers.</li><li><strong>There’s No Such Thing As A Simple Escape</strong> – This immersive sim isn’t for the faint of heart.

The player takes on the role of a broken but powerful ex-soldier named Clem, a war veteran, talented fighter and expert mech pilot. Clem attempts to shed the guilt and shame of her past and become a legitimate force for good in the Red Expanse, a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Customizable Mech Action</strong> – You pilot the Desert Raptor MKII, a Mech of extraordinary power. It is a highly-customizable battle vehicle that can be equipped with a variety of offensive systems: heavy, high-powered melee weapons, steam powered hydraulic siege weapons, explosive firearms, and more. It can also be equipped with a variety of defensive systems; high-speed thrusters, boosters for dashing, riot shields, among others.</li><li><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong> – The Red Expanse is a rich farming and mercantile region plagued by violent <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and dangerous beasts. The government that remains outsources justice to experts like Clem—bounty hunters who are free to pursue their targets into whatever dangerous corners of the world they hide. She’ll fight her way through many corners of the region and deal with these marks as she sees fit.</li><li><strong>Repair and Upgrade Your Homestead</strong> – Clem comes into an isolated and run-down garage that serves as a suitable base of operations and home—just barely. Build out water and power supply lines, grow and cook food, produce ammunition and fuel for combat, and raise animals. This decrepit ruin has a lot of potential, but it will have to grow alongside Clem.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

Every move—whether shooting, jumping, or dodging—syncs to the beat, making rhythm as crucial as reflexes. As players explore procedurally generated dungeons, they’ll uncover a wide variety of powerful weapons, unique items, and rhythm-based abilities. Enemies attack in time with the music, turning every battle into a high-stakes dance of destruction. Feel the intensity rise as the beat drives both you and your foes in an immersive, music-fueled combat experience. Plus, with the custom music feature, you can add your own tracks to the game and experience a whole new level of rhythm-driven chaos.</p><p><strong>The Final Beat</strong></p><p>Ragnarok, the prophesied end of the world, is approaching, a seemingly unstoppable and inevitable event. However, there’s a belief that it can be averted. The Azure Ember, the universe’s rhythmic pulse, is key to its prevention. The slowing of this Azure Ember is the cause of Ragnarok’s approach; once it ceases, the world will end. Hel, the Queen of Helheim, actively seeks to accelerate Ragnarok by draining Melody Fragments from the Azure Ember.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Rhythm Combat</strong></p><p>Enter a world where destruction is an art form, and combat unfolds as a deadly dance synchronized with the music’s pulse. Your shots must land in perfect time, but so too must those of your adversaries. Foes swarm and strike in unison, their most devastating attacks telegraphed beats before impact. Victory hinges not merely on precision aiming, but on impeccable timing. Anticipate the rhythm, leap to evade incoming barrages, and unleash your own rhythmic counter-fire to decimate your enemies.</p><p><strong>Death is Not the End</strong></p><p>Defeat is inevitable, but it’s also the key to progress. While each death will send you back to the hub (we call it The Sanctum) without your run-specific upgrades, any permanent meta-progression you’ve unlocked is yours to keep. Learn from your mistakes, visit The Sanctum to grow stronger with your new unlocks, and dive back in ready to push further than before.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Unleash your arsenal and outmaneuver foes in perfect sync with the music.</li><li>Each dungeon is procedurally generated giving the player a different experience each time.</li><li>With custom music support, you can fight to the rhythm of any song you own.</li><li>Found the perfect dungeon? Use its unique seed to replay it, master every corner for a speedrun.</li><li>Create a level playing field.
