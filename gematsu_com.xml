      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Series > Tales of [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> Kenzara: ZAU</em> and <em><a title="Games > Dead Take [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dead-take">Dead Take</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Surgent Studios [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/surgent-studios">Surgent Studios</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > FixForce" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fixforce">FixForce</a></em>, a cooperative extraction <a title="Genres > Platformer [832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> for up to six players. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,583 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3933150/FixForce/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/fixforce-e12c61" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on March 12, followed by a full release across <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,776 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and PC later in 2026. <span id="more-1029331"></span></p><p>“We saw the pure chaos and hilarity <em>FixForce</em> unleashed as it came together, so we made the decision to move quickly and publish it ourselves,” said Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim in a press release. “Yes, <em>FixForce</em> is completely unlike anything we’ve ever done before, but look: we made one game about grief and another about abuse and thought, ‘can we have a little bit of silly, stupid fun for a second?’ I promise we’ll go back to dark and depressing after this!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3933150/FixForce/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Leap, climb, and launch your friends in this chaotic cooperative extraction platformer for up to six players! Use your drill-wrench to build your way across a vibrant post-apocalyptic world, find replacement parts, and fix broken machines. And if you lose your head, don’t worry: it’s all part of the job.</p><p><strong>Build With Friends</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As FixForce bots, you and up to five friends will build towers and paths out of scrap parts, using the structures to climb all over the worksite. Rescue each other when things get hairy, and remember: how high or far you go is limited only by how much scrap you can find.</p><p><strong>Find + Fix</strong></p><p>In each round, you and your team will be dropped near machines in desperate need of repair. Once you’ve found them, use your drill-wrench to scour the site for the perfect replacement parts to get them working again so you can clock out on time. You might even find a few extra odd jobs around to line your pockets…</p><p><strong>Workplace Hazards</strong></p><p>No job is the same, but they’re all teeming with hazards and violent rogue robots. Keep your eyes peeled so you can protect yourself, your friends, and your precious towers and bridges from their destructive wrath while you finish the job.</p><p><strong>But Don’t Lose Your Head</strong></p><p><em>FixForce</em> means reliability, and high-risk assignments are your bread and butter. If you take a tumble, slip into the water, or find yourself on the wrong side of a rogue bot, your friends can simply recover your head and snap it onto another body. Good as new!</p><p><strong>Perks of the Job</strong></p><p>The work is relentless, but so is your resolve! Every successful fix lines your bank account, letting you snag new tools to maximise efficiency and tackle even the toughest of challenges in exchange for a few unorthodox updates to your uniform.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1029366"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Wield the Drill-Wrench</strong> – Use your built-in power tool to fix machines, build towers and bridges to get around, retrieve your friends’ fallen heads, and launch items around.</li><li><strong>Extraction Loop</strong> – Arrive on-site in your utility van, locate the broken machines, find the parts to fix them, and clock out on time!</li><li><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge Your Battery</strong> – Your battery can be used to power all sorts of things on the job, not just you!
