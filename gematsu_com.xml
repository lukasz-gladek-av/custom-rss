      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Warner Bros. Games [641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> president David Hadddad will step down after 12 years of leading the company’s interactive entertainment division, the company announced. <span id="more-940031"></span></p><p>Haddad will stay on board with the company for the next three months as parent company Warner Bros. Discovery seeks his replacement and to help oversee the transition.</p><p>“David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title,” Warner Bros. Discovery global streaming and games CEO and president JB Perrette said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>Haddad commented, “I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.”</p><p>Here is the full internal note sent to staff from Perrette announcing Haddad’s exit:</p><blockquote><p>Global Games Team,</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I wanted to share with you the news that after 12 incredible years leading [Warner Bros. Discovery] Games, David Haddad has decided to depart the company.</p><p>On behalf of David Zaslav and all of us at WBD, I want to express my deepest gratitude to David for his phenomenal work and passion during his time here. With the support and incredible efforts of this whole team, David has led WB Games to numerous accomplishments over the years, both creatively and commercially. His vision, talent and passion have helped build one of the most successful and admired gaming companies in the industry and navigated some of the biggest changes and challenges as well.</p><p>From transitioning a physical software company into a digital-first gaming operation to organically building a successful <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [360 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> mobile business to developing and publishing multiple billion-dollar games and franchises—including <em><a title="Games > Hogwarts Legacy [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a></em>, <em>Game of Thrones Conquest</em>, and <em>Golf Clash</em>—to delighting more Mortal Kombat fans than any time in the franchise’s 30+ year history, the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title. David has also graciously agreed to stay on through the next three months as we kick-off a search to fill this important leadership role and will help ensure a smooth transition. This transition period will also provide me with additional opportunities to engage directly with the Games leadership, and I look forward to getting even more immersed with all of you and in this incredible business.</p><p>I fully appreciate that particularly after 12 years with the same leader and boss, change can be hard and uncomfortable (in our industry and at WBD we have certainly had our fair share). But it also brings opportunity, a chance for healthy new perspectives, and the ability to create the next incredible chapter for our fans and business… and I’m excited to embark on that with you.</p><p>I’m sure you have many questions due to this news, so David and I will be gathering with you at the scheduled Town Hall shortly. You may have more questions than we have answers right now, but we want to respond to what we can.</p><p>Thankfully we will have some more time to celebrate and thank David, but I know you’ll join me in this initial congratulations and thank you for this remarkable chapter he has led.</p><p>—JB</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PS5</a></li>    </ul>

    
    <p><span>"Development is progressing smoothly."</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The untitled third entry in the&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> project, following&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>, is currently about nine months into development, according to director Naoki Hamaguchi. <span id="more-940012"></span></p><p>“Regarding the third game, we started working on it immediately after finishing <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>—around March or April 2024—so we’ve already been in development for about nine months,” Hamaguchi told <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/865/G086563/20250121053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer.net</a> in an interview for the release of the <a title="Platforms > PC [22,181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. “Our goal for 2024 was to solidify the gameplay experience we were aiming for with the third entry of the <em>Remake</em> project, and we put together a great build that aligns with the team’s overall direction and vision.</p><p>“Starting in 2025, we’ve entered the phase of building and refining the game based on the plan we’ve established, and development is progressing smoothly and at a good pace, following the schedule I initially laid out. I can’t say when I’ll be able to share more information, but please stay tuned.”</p><p>Producer Yoshinori Kitase added, “When it comes to large, story-driven <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> projects, the pace of development depends heavily on whether the story itself is fully locked in. For the third game’s story, after I received the scenario from [scenario write Kazushige] Nojima, I asked him to give it a greater sense of completeness since this is the final game. We just wrapped that up a few days ago, so I feel that things are progressing smoothly.”</p><p>While <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> originally released on <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, sequel <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> released on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,694 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> without a PlayStation 4 version. Asked whether users can expect the third game to follow the trend of only being available on the next generation of consoles, Kitase laughed and said, “No, no, don’t worry about that next time.”</p><p>Earlier in the interview, 4Gamer.net asked Hamaguchi why the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> games have had staggered releases on PC, rather than launching day and date with their <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> versions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Hamaguchi explained, “First off, the&nbsp;<em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [136 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> brand and franchise, and by extension, <a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, have built a very strong partnership with <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>. I strongly hope this continues going forward. However, it’s also true that we are no longer in an era where limiting the hardware on which you can play&nbsp; offers only substantial benefits. In fact, we’ve been seeing more and more cases where [Sony Interactive Entertainment]’s titles are being released for PC in addition to PlayStation 5.</p><p>“Through this&nbsp;<em>Remake</em> project, we also realized this shift, and have <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/square-enix-announces-new-medium-term-business-plan-square-enix-reboots-and-awakens-3-years-of-foundation-laying-for-long-term-growth">announced</a> as a company that we will be gearing towards multiplatform development. New [intellectual property] will be developed along these lines, so I personally believe it to be inevitable that console and PC versions will be released at the same time, or extremely close to each other, going forward.”</p><p>Later on in the interview, after Kitase’s comment about the third game not being exclusive to the next generation of consoles, Hamaguchi said,. “As I said earlier, going forward, [Square Enix] plans to release titles across a wide range of platforms so that more people can enjoy them. While I can’t make any promises at this point, we want our games to be played by as many people as possible, so we’ll do our best.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> first launched for PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. The PC version launched via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
