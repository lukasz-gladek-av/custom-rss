            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p>Hello players,</p><p>Today, we’d like to share an important update regarding the <em>PUBG Console</em> service.</p><p>As mentioned in our 2025 roadmap, we’ve been preparing to transition <em>PUBG Console</em> to current-generation consoles.</p><p>Starting November 13, <em>PUBG Console</em> will be supported only on PlayStation 5 and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,669 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This shift is a necessary step toward aligning <em>PUBG Console</em> with current-gen consoles. To provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates, we’ve decided to transition to current-gen consoles. Following this transition, console players will see improved visuals and more stable frame rates. In addition, we expect to reduce ongoing crash issues through memory-related optimizations.</p><p>As part of this transition, we will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p><p>It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed <em>PUBG</em> on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years.</p><p>We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent with us over the past eight years.</p><p>This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of <em>PUBG Console</em>. We kindly ask for your understanding and invite players using PlayStation 4 or Xbox One to review the details below.</p><p><strong>■ End of Support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One / Transition to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong></p><p><strong>Transition Schedule</strong></p><ul><li>During the live server maintenance on November 13, 2025.</li></ul><p>*Please note that the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process of each platform. Any updates will be shared separately.</p><p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p><ul><li>After the live server maintenance on November 13, <em>PUBG Console</em> will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <em>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</em> will no longer be downloadable or playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</li><li>Your existing account data and purchased items will be securely preserved. You can log in on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the transition and continue playing with your existing account—no separate transfer process required.</li><li><a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> users will need to download the PlayStation 5 version of <em>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</em> from the PlayStation Store after November 13 in order to continue playing. Xbox users who already have the game installed will receive the current-gen version automatically via Smart Delivery starting November 13.</li></ul><p><strong>Refund Information</strong></p><ul><li>Refunds for BATTLEGROUNDS Plus and <em>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</em> will be handled in accordance with each platform’s refund policy and procedures. For more details, please contact the customer support team of your respective platform.</li></ul><p><strong>Supported Specs After Transition to Current-Gen Consoles</strong></p><p>Following the transition of <em>PUBG Console</em> to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, the supported specifications will be as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Xbox Series S</th><th>Xbox Series X</th><th>PlayStation 5</th><th>PlayStation 5 Pro</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th><p>Resolution</p></th><td>1080p / 1440p</td><td>2160p</td><td>1440p</td><td>2160p</td></tr><tr><th><a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,744 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">FPS</a></th><td>60 frames per second / 30 frames per second</td><td>60 frames per second</td><td>60 frames per second</td><td>69 frames per second</td></tr></tbody></table><p>*Xbox Series S supports either 1080p at 60 frames per second, or 1440p at 30 frames per second, and you can choose between the two settings.<br>*Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 Pro support Dynamic 4K resolution.</p><p><strong>PlayStation 5: Before Transition to Current-Gen</strong> (PlayStation 4 Version on PlayStation 5)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PUBG-Console_08-13-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>PlayStation 5: After Transition to Current-Gen</strong> (Native PlayStation 5 Version)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PUBG-Console_08-13-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized <em>PUBG Console</em> gameplay experience. In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly.</p><p>As <em>PUBG Console</em> supports cross-play between platforms, fairness across all platforms was one of our top priorities. With this in mind, our goal is to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To account for differences in hardware performance, Xbox Series S will offer selectable options such as Resolution Mode and Performance Mode.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, this transition to current-gen consoles is not only aimed at providing a more stable environment, but also at preparing for larger updates in the future. It marks an important step forward for the long-term growth of <em>PUBG Console</em>, and will allow us to respond more swiftly to the evolving needs of the console ecosystem.</p><p>We sincerely thank you for your continued interest and support in <em>PUBG Console</em>, and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible gameplay experience going forward.</p><p>We’ll see you on the Battlegrounds.</p><p>—<em>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</em> Team</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/pubg-battlegrounds-for-ps4-and-xbox-one-to-end-service-on-november-13-alongside-ps5-and-xbox-series-launch]]></content:encoded>
