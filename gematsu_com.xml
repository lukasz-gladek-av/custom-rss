After walking the plank of your previous ship, you find yourselves adrift in the depths of the ‘ol legendary Sea Hole. Your only chance of <a title="Genres > Survival [396 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is to repair derelict ships, solve tricky contraptions, and gather fuel to save yer hinds!</p><p><strong>Catch Serious Air!</strong></p><p>Ahoy! Wipe away that elbow grease and get ready to put your trusty rocket-powered wrench to the test! Every ship is your ultimate skatepark. Use a simple auto system to perform unique midair tricks, such as the stalefrog, 360 ribbit, and nostril grab. String unique trick combinations to fill up your boost meter, granting you a special power to access hard-to-reach items. Swing into leaky bolts for repairs to gradually power up further hulls on the upper decks, and top off your combos with a manual for extra points. Rely on your handy C-Star navigator to seek the ship’s corridors, ensuring you collect all items in every map location, opening up further world progression. Gather enough barnacles to fuel your ship, then strap in to launch from a cannon, bouncing off to other ship locations!</p><!-- AD: content -->
