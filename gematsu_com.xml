Powered by Unreal 5 Engine and enhanced with proprietary tools and technologies by the studio, <em>Blood Message</em> is NetEase Games’ first AAA single-player title, blending brutal <a title="Genres > Survival [428 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> combat with profound Eastern storytelling.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Blood Message</em> introduces a forgotten odyssey of loyalty and survival where players join Dunhuang’s uprising, taking control of a nameless messenger and his young son in this immersive third-person action-adventure. Caught in the crossfire of a righteous uprising and driven by loyalty to both family and country, players will embark on a perilous eastward journey to deliver a message that holds the fate of their war-torn homeland. Amidst the shifting sands of history, they will etch a final tale of loyalty.</p><p>Set during the final years of the Tang Dynasty, players will traverse a treacherous 3,000-li (around 1,000 miles) odyssey back to Chang’an, the heart of the Tang Empire. Cross lethal landscapes including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain, and overwhelming odds. The game’s setting in the last years of the Tang Dynasty provides a cultural landmark of Chinese history that frames the story with customs, culture, and rich history of the era.</p><p>How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history? The <em>Blood Message</em> development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.</p><p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes—not emperors or generals—but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, the father and son must navigate a collapsing world, torn between duty to country and love for family. When history forgets, warriors remember. The world has heard too many stories of emperors and generals—<em>Blood Message</em> is an ode to the unsung heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven gameplay anchored in cinematic storytelling.</li><li>Visceral, realistic combat blending <a title="Genres > Stealth [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and survival mechanics.</li><li>A deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity.</li><li>Expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang (敦煌).</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

A major downloadable content expansion, “Overture,” launched on June 6, 2025.</p><p>Here is a brief overview of the game, via Neowiz:</p><blockquote><p>Inspired by the familiar story of <em>Pinocchio</em>, <em>Lies of P</em> is an action Soulslike game set in the dark, Belle Epoque-inspired city of Krat. Once a beautiful city, Krat has become a living nightmare as deadly puppets run amok and a plague sweeps the land. Play as a puppet who must fight his way through the city on his unrelenting journey to find Geppetto and finally become human. Lies of P presents an elegant world filled with tension, deep combat and character customization systems, and a gripping story with interesting narrative choices where the more lies told, the more human P becomes. Just remember: in a world filled with lies, no one can be trusted…</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
