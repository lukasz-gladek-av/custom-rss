      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Astrolabe Games [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/astrolabe-games">Astrolabe Games</a> and solo developer <a title="Companies > Ino Kinwen" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ino-kinwen">Ino Kinwen</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Rusty Winter" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rusty-winter">Rusty Winter</a></em>, a 2.5D pixel art narrative-focused <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,859 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> coming to <a title="Platforms > PC [21,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290380/Rusty_Winter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-926822"></span></p><p><em>Rusty Winter</em> features pixel art, original music, animated cutscenes, and a variety of nostalgic minigames. Players become a self-made detective in a world where reality and the surreal intertwine, diving into a series of missing person cases and uncovering hidden truths within the city.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Astrolabe Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Rusty Winter</em> is a game that is inspired by classic hard-boiled detective stories and good old urban legends. Set against the cold, industrial backdrop of the City of Ge’shan—a place echoing the faded glory of once-thriving industrial towns—the narrative unfolds as a romantic yet serious story infused with dark undertones and surreal twists. Using a delicate, richly-detailed pixel art style, the game brings every shadowed alley and forgotten corner of Ge’shan to life, as the protagonist unravel its strange mysteries one clue at a time.</p><p>The story revolves around a complex missing person case. Meet a cast of characters as diverse and worn as the city itself, and chase down leads that blurs the boundaries between reality and the paranormal. Uncover urban legends, and maybe even dive into some absurd extraterrestrial tales. Original music, vivid animations, and nostalgic mini-games enrich the journey across a decaying town on the brink of change. Along the way, witness the struggles of the townsfolk, catching glimpses of transformation—and perhaps even redemption.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_926830"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Setting: City of Ge’shan, 2016</strong></p><p>Late 2016, City of Ge’Shan—a northern industrial hub that has seen better days—is shrouded in mystery due to a series of unsettling disappearances. The story follows a self-made underdog detective driven by the search for a missing loved one, navigating shadowed streets, relying solely on instincts and determination in order to uncover the truth.</p><p>Explore many meticulously-crafted locations where realism intertwines with the surreal. Each scene is designed to draw deeper into the narrative, immersing in moments where time seems to stand still, and where memories resurface.</p><p><strong>Urban Legend: The Myth of the “Land <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a>“</strong></p><p>For many years, whispers have long circulated through Ge’shan about the Anunnaki—ancient celestial beings who once visited Earth and left behind a hidden relic in the icy reaches of the far north.</p><p>Locals speak of the “Land Beneath,” it surely isn’t about wealth or eternal life; it’s a key—a gateway to another world, an ultra-advanced utopia beyond human understanding. The devoted ones hold onto the belief that one day, the Anunnaki WILL RETURN.</p><p>As the city’s mysteries are unraveled, the line between the legend and reality itself begins to blur, and the myth of the Land Beneath becomes entwined with the detective’s own quest.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p>On an asteroid-bound service station in an unfrequented space lane, Wilbur carves out a paltry living as a mechanic, repairing as many ships as he can to afford the ever-rising R.E.N.T payments to his corporate overlord, Uncle Chop. Where most of his customers find meaning in pastimes like worshipping deranged space gods, feeding random crap to a sentient black hole, endlessly digging for The <a title="Companies > Treasure [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/treasure">Treasure</a>™ or mentally enslaving donut shop workers, Wilbur lives a more humble life, fixing the galaxy’s ills one broken ship module at a time.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fix Stuff</strong> – Using a range of tools, diagnostic devices, parts and workshop appliances, you’ll be correcting faults in the modules of procedurally generated spaceships. From simple refuel jobs to total overhauls, get ready to frantically fumble, slice, loosen, tighten, grab and drop as you try to complete as many jobs as you can within each daily time limit. With a huge variety of ships and modules, your hands are gonna get real dirty real fast, in some real unusual places.</li><li><strong>Read Stuff</strong> – Flaunt your basic literacy by consulting manual pages for guidance on diagnosing and correcting faults in spaceship modules, as well as operating workshop appliances.

All your IKEA furniture-assembly training has led to this moment.</li><li><strong>Upgrade Stuff</strong> – Using whatever hard-earned pennies Uncle Chop doesn’t take from you, expand your workshop and kit it out with a range of workstations. From industrial devices to esoteric altars, these workstations will allow you to fix bigger and more lucrative ships.</li><li><strong>Talk About Stuff</strong> – Interact with a diverse range of oddballs as you engage with both anthology-style storytelling and a multiple-ending, overarching narrative. The lore is (*consults notes*) “deep and rich and good,” with different factions you can choose to ingratiate yourself with – each with their own inane agendas.</li><li><strong>Discover Stuff</strong> – Narrative and random events, hidden puzzles and upgrades, secret lore—we got all that goodness that ensures each day and gameplay run will feel substantially different from the last.</li><li><strong>Do All That Stuff Again, But Better</strong> – Meeting those escalating R.E.N.T payments ain’t gonna be easy, but chin up, champ – certain station upgrades will persist across gameplay runs, making life a little more tolerable every time around.
