Go sledding, relax and see what else there is to do. There’s also ragdoll physics so the crashes look terrible really really good.</p><ul><li><strong>Hang Out</strong> – Use proximity voice chat to talk to your friends, or express your feelings by repeatedly crashing into each other.</li><li><strong>Sled Fast, Sled Stupid</strong> – Compete to see who can reach the bottom first or get the most points through gnarly tricks, building your own ramps and launching off them. Or you can just sled around and explore, up to you.</li><li><strong>Do Other Stuff</strong> – Break up the sledding with side activities and minigames, like snowball fights, snowmen making, darts, curling, roasting smores, drinking hot chocolate in the cozy cabin, and more.</li><li><strong>Lookin’ Good</strong> – Choose from a range of fully customizable animal characters and expressions. Earn points to spend on cool cosmetics for your bod and your sled.</li><li><strong>Get Kicked by a Yeti</strong> – This isn’t a joke if you wander of course a yeti will literally come and kick you back on like a football</li></ul><p><strong>Join the <a title="Games > Sledders" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sledders">Sledders</a></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Join public or private lobbies to sled with friends or meet new ones. Sit on a bench with a homie, or race down the hill with your group. With up to 50* players, the ski-lift could get quite the line.</p><p><em>*I’m hoping I can do 50-player lobbies, but until further testing, this will just be a guess. Also I’m not sure if too many people will feel overcrowded, so I might want to keep it smaller.</em></p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [630 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> sledding fun.</li><li>Talk through proximity chat.</li><li>Races and cool tricks.</li><li>Mini games and hang out spots.</li><li>Public and private lobbies.</li><li>Ragdoll physics.</li><li>Customizable avatars.</li><li>Fun and friendly community.</li><li>Yeti.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Xbox Series Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Just a normal trailer with a small announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLaEihrVIOo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/sledding-game-adds-xbox-series-version]]></content:encoded>
