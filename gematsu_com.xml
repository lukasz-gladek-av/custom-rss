      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Kinetic Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> has announced the 2025 roadmap for four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [230 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> psychological <a title="Genres > Horror [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Phasmophobia [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a></em>, including major reworks, new ghost-hunting tools, seasonal events, and a new map. The Early Access version of the game has also sold over two million units across <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,803 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [227 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, 104 days after its console launch. <span id="more-942984"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the upcoming updates, via Kinetic Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>First Major Update: “Chronicle”</strong></p><p>The first major update, “Chronicle,” will bring changes to the journal and rework the way in which Ghost Hunters can capture evidence. The Photos tab will be replaced with a Media tab featuring three new sections—Photos, Videos, and Sound Recordings—with any photographic, audio, or visual evidence logged in the corresponding pages. </p><p>The game’s media quality system is being replaced too, with a players’ first “capture” of any media type labelled as “Unique.” These will reward lots of cash and XP at the end of a contract, while “duplicates” will reward much less.</p><p>Chronicle will also introduce the Sound Recorder, a brand new piece of equipment designed to record unique paranormal sounds. Players brave enough to do so will be able to listen back to their recordings in the updated journal, letting them discover helpful clues that may previously have been drowned out by terrified screams.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Players will be able to explore a garden just outside the main living room, complete with ghost rooms, as well as revamped areas to explore. Grafton Farmhouse will also receive an update later this year.</p><p><strong>More to Come</strong></p><p>There’s even more to come, with a player character overhaul, new small map, and updates for the Easter, Halloween and Holiday seasons set to arrive in 2025. Plans for 2026 are already underway too, with house map reworks, even more new maps, and Horror 2.0 in the works.</p></blockquote><p>“We’re beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to <em>Phasmophobia</em> this year,” said Kinetic Games director and <em>Phasmophobia</em> lead developer Daniel Knight in a press release. “Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we’re making are a direct reflection of the feedback we’re seeing. We’re really proud of the direction <em>Phasmophobia</em> is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can’t wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025.”</p><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, Xbox Series, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
