Physical editions will also be available for PlayStation 5 and Switch.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Clear River Games:</p><blockquote><p>Originally released in 1998 on <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> to great acclaim, the highly-acclaimed shoot-’em-up returns, remastered, reloaded, and looking razor-sharp, with updated high-definition visuals, a new opening movie, a remixed soundtrack, and a heap of quality-of-life features to bring the dark science-fiction gem to modern machines.</p><p>In the year 2163, having triumphed over the Bydo Empire, the R9 was recovered and stored within a space fortress orbiting Earth. Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction. To bring the situation under control, the prototype test unit “R9 Delta” is deployed—marking the beginning of a new battle against the Bydo.</p><p>Running in silky smooth 60 frames per second and with the option to dynamically switch between the original graphics and high-definition visuals at the start of each gaming session, <em>R-Type Delta HD Boosted</em> features numerous options and new additions catering to modern gamers. The much-loved soundtrack has received a refresh, with newly-arranged compositions from <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ahiko Ishida (<em>R-Type II</em>), as well as USP (<em>R-Type Delta</em>) and Chris Hulsbeck (<em>R-Type</em> for C64 and Amiga). There is also an option to adjust the screen size, and multiple difficult settings alongside an all-new practice mode provide players the opportunity to hone their skills before facing down the Bydo Empire for real.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
