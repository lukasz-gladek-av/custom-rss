Vex the Siren is a powerful Siren who can empower herself or manifest deadly shades to fight alongside her, while Rafa the Exo-Soldier shines as a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of digistructing an arsenal of weapons. Each Vault Hunter offers a unique playstyle, further augmented through the most advanced skill tree system in a <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> game to-date.</p><p>Across the vast and seamlessly connected planet of Kairos, players will face the oppressive Timekeeper. For thousands of years, he kept the planet hidden, controlling its inhabitants with cybernetic implants called Bolts and an army of synthetic soldiers known as The Order. Players will travel across the planet where they’ll encounter new and returning characters, creatures and inhabitants to battle, and unique factions spread across four distinct regions that seek freedom from the tyranny of the Timekeeper. The friends discovered along the way will be recruited by players to their cause while enemies will experience first-hand the arsenal of weapons and abilities wielded by the Vault Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_962401"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the explosive footage shared during PlayStation’s State of Play, Vex and Rafa tear a path through a secret blacksite in Terminus Range, a frigid, mountainous region.
