        <p>Originally released in 2005, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard</em> returns in a respectful re-release that quietly modernizes the classic: modern-resolution support, localization-friendly saves and profiles, smoother timers and physics, ASLR compatibility, and other under-the-hood fixes for a cleaner experience on today’s PCs.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard</em> is a real-time strategy experience based in the mystical world of Eberron, the acclaimed <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> realm.

As players direct troops over the land, they also plunge smaller, hero-led parties below ground to an RPG-modeled world of beasts, battles, and bounty. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> and items gained in this underworld result in great powers and abilities above ground. Using magic, weaponry, and skilled maneuvers, players command armies from varying races to control, protect, or destroy the powerful Heart of Siberys.
