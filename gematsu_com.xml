            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,393 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will release a physical edition of <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> on December 4, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1976271756118868009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-999008"></span></p><p>Previously only available as a digital bundle, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</em> includes both <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> and <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of each game, via Square Enix:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></strong></p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is the first game in the <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> Trilogy</em>, and is set entirely in the city of Midgar.</p><p>This circular steel city is built on the power of mako—the planet’s lifeforce, which is processed and turned into energy by the Shinra Electric Power Company.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The story begins when mercenary Cloud Strife joins the anti-Shinra resistance group Avalanche on a mission to destroy one of their mako-siphoning reactors. It’s meant to be a one-time gig, but before long Cloud is sucked into an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that puts him on a collision course with a dark figure from his past: Sephiroth.</p><p>It’s a fast-paced tale that combines action and spectacle with powerful character moments. The iconic party of Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith are portrayed in greater depth than ever before—and by the time the credits roll, you’ll love them like friends.</p><p>The action’s pretty great too though. The combat system fuses intense real-time action with menu-based commands—in other words, the exhilarating action of a modern <a title="Genres > Action [3,119 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> with the deep strategy of a <a title="Genres > Turn-Based RPG [1,320 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/turn-based-rpg">turn-based RPG</a>.</p><p>As well as the main <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> story, the <em>Intergrade</em> edition of the game also includes “EPISODE INTERmission.” This two chapter tale takes place concurrently with the main campaign and stars fan-favorite ninja Yuffie Kisaragi.</p><p>With a new character to control, new parts of Midgar to explore and the endlessly entertaining Fort Condor minigame, it’s an essential play before you head into the next game in this pack…</p><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The second game in the remake series follows Cloud and his comrades as they step out of the city of Midgar and into the wider world in pursuit of their enemy, Sephiroth.</p><p>This globe-trotting tale is full of amazing stories and unforgettable places—the war-torn region of Junon, the glitz and glamor of the Gold Saucer, the verdant forests of Gongaga and much more.</p><p>New playable party members join the team too. You’ll take control of Red XIII, Yuffie and Cait Sith, each offering new playstyles and abilities in battle. In battle, you can use new Synergy abilities that let characters team up to deliver powerful attacks.</p><p>The world of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> also provides plenty of diversions and opportunities for a talented mercenary. You can take on side jobs, scour the world for valuable intel, battle powerful fiends, play a few hands of the card game Queen’s Blood, become a chocobo jockey in fast-paced races, take on the many challenges of the battle simulator and much more.</p><p>In short, it’s an incredible game—there’s a reason it won more than 40 Game of the Year awards in 2024!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-ps5-physical-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>
