You’ll be able to explore three different island types ranging in difficulty, with various wildlife, ancient tech enemies and puzzles. And of course, you can build, customize and upgrade your own skyship, whether you’d like to turn it into a cozy base for solo adventures or a powerful battleship for your crew.</p><p>“You’ll also face the biggest threat in Outskirts, the first Herald boss—a massive mechanical creature that will test your ship’s strength and your crew’s coordination. All of this is wrapped in a progression loop centered around <a title="Genres > Crafting [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, upgrading, and exploration.
