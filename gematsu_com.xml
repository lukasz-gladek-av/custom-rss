With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the <em>Demeo</em> <a title="Genres > Action [2,754 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Roleplaying System.”</p><p>narrative lead Mat Sernett added, “When <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> launched fifth edition back in 2014, the first <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,298 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for <em>Battlemarked</em> players to begin their journey. The first adventure in <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.”</p><div id="carousel_969425"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Resolution Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

Uncover the secrets of her father’s mysterious past and harness enchanted powers as you face off against spectacular villains in beat-driven boss battles.</p><p>One such villain making his debut in the demo? Fantoccio—a dramatic, slightly unhinged puppet who’s been trapped in the crumbling magical city of Harpis Major for fifteen long years. When Billie stumbles into his world, Fantoccio seizes the chance to finally stage the grand play he’s been planning in the name of “friendship.” There’s just one small catch: Billie isn’t exactly thrilled about being cast. So naturally, Fantoccio’s next move is… brainwashing!</p><p>With unforgettable characters, original toe-tapping songs, and a story that dances between heartfelt and hilarious, <em>Billie Bust Up</em> hits all the right notes.</p><!-- AD: content -->
