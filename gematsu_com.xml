        <p>As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most.</p><p>We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone’s contribution up to this point.</p><p>—Sebastian Wojciechowski, CEO</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
