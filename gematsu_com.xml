It will launch on August 28 worldwide. <span id="more-960401"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via FuRyu:</p><blockquote><p><em>VARLET</em> draws upon FuRyu’s experience developing immersive, story-driven games, and will challenge players to explore the duality of their own nature as they navigate the perilous high school halls.</p><p>Welcome within the halls of Kousei Academy, the first school to implement the cross-reality, <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> network known as “Johari,” which is used for everything from finding basic information and making purchases to serving as a social networking and messaging app. The app has resulted in a marked increase in users desire for approval and attention amongst peers, and soon an urban legend begins circulating about users disappearing into otherworldly “Glitches” if those desires grow too strong. And worse yet, monsters inhabiting the “Glitches” are said to replace users in the real world leaving everyone none the wiser.</p><p>The protagonist soon discovers that this urban legend is very real and some students have already been replaced by monsters, forcing them to take a stand. As a member of the Student Support Services (SSS), a guild dedicated to solving the academy’s troubles, players must guide their friends, strengthen bonds, and fight to protect the school from impending doom. However, navigating these relationships comes with its own challenges—getting too close to multiple people may lead to unexpected consequences.</p><p>At the core of <em>VARLET</em>‘s experience is its dynamic Triad Stats system, which shapes character progression based on player choices. These six distinct attributes are divided between Light and Dark Triad traits, influencing dialogue options and passive battle skills. Light Triad stats emphasize morality, sympathy, and altruism, while Dark Triad stats lean into Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Players will determine their true nature, either as a guiding leader who uplifts and empowers allies in battle or as a ruthless ruler wielding immense power even at a personal cost.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
