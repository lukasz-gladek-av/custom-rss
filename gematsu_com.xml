      </p></div><div><p>GOG and <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,580 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> have released the <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> version of <em>Breath of Fire IV</em> via <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> for $9.99, the companies announced. <span id="more-961232"></span></p><p><em>Breath of Fire IV</em> first launched for PlayStation on April 27, 2000, followed by PC on May 30, 2003.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In a far-away world, two continents float, separated by a vast swamp-land. For eons, no contact existed between the two continents because ships couldn’t sail across the expanse. At last, when the historic first contact was made between the two powers, war erupted!</p><p>After long and costly fighting between the Fou Empire in the west and an alliance of countries in the east, both sides exhausted all their strength and resources. With no other alternative, the two powers agreed to an armistice.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>One year later, Princess Elena vanished. She had been traveling in the east from town to town, exploring battlegrounds and visiting war veterans. Her trail vanished in a small town near the front line. Nobody knew her whereabouts!</p><p>The Eastern Alliance wanted to avoid sending a large army to the front. Such a move would be a political blunder, breaking the armistice and stirring up hostilities. It became impossible to carry out a large-scale search for Elena. Time passed… with no sign of the princess.</p><p>Elena’s sister, Princess Nina, finally makes up her mind. She leaves on a journey in search of her sister—by herself.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ryu</strong> – Ryu meets Nina while he is lying unconscious on a street in a desert town in the eastern continent. His race and native land are unknown. Ryu has a Dragon’s Eye, which empowers him with the amazing abilities to transform into a dragon and summon dragons.</li><li><strong>Nina</strong> – The princess of Wyndia, a town of the Fae tribe (winged folk). Nina meets Ryu on her journey to seek her lost sister Elena. Though somewhat naïve, Nina is skilled in Healing magic.</li><li><strong>Scias</strong> – A mercenary soldier, Scias was hired by the eastern side during the war. Scias becomes the party’s watcher. He is very quiet and aloof from the world. Scias can perform a powerful double attack with his sword.</li><li><strong>Cray</strong> – A young leader of the Woren tribe (cat people) in the eastern alliance, Cray joins Nina to search for Princess Elena, his childhood friend. He has a strong sense of responsibility and acts as the leader of the party. His high offensive and defensive abilities are very dependable.</li><li><strong>Ershin</strong> – Ershin wears completely sealed armor to protect her from any kind of curse. Since she wears the armor all the time, no one knows her real face or background. She meets the party in a mysterious place polluted by a curse and decides to join them.</li><li><strong>Ursula</strong> – Ursula is a middle-class leader of the Fou Empire. She came to the eastern continent in search of dragons, and meets up with Ryu and his companions. Ursula was brought up in the military, and knows very little about worldly concerns. She is excellent at attacking with both magic and weapons.</li><li><strong>Fou-Lu</strong> – Fou-lu unified the western continent single-handedly with his paranormal powers. He became the first emperor of the Fou Empire several hundred years ago. Despite his youthful look, he has mystic dignity. It is said that he predicted his own resurrection as he passed away.</li></ul><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p><p>Here’s how we ensured that this masterpiece is better than ever and what you can expect with GOG’s version of the game:</p><ul><li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11</li><li>Both two localizations of the game included (English and Japanese)</li><li>Improved DirectX game renderer</li><li>New rendering options (windowed mode, vertical synchronization control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing, and more)</li><li>Improved audio engine (restored missing environmental sounds and audio configuration)</li><li>Improved keyboard and mouse support</li><li>Improved Warehouse and Crane minigames</li><li>Improved F9 exit screen</li><li>Issue-free battle and combo system (all crashes have been fixed)</li><li>Issue-free cutscene scripting</li><li>Issue-free task switching</li><li>Full support for modern controllers (DualSense, DualShock4, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox 360 [9,999 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-360">Xbox 360</a>, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series, and many more) with optimal button binding, vibration, hotplugging, and wireless mode</li></ul><p>Let’s go back in time to the PlayStation 1 era and reminisce about how <em>Breath of Fire IV</em> was presented to gamers back in 2000:</p><p>After centuries of war, the two lands bordering an impenetrable swampland have finally reached an armistice. <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>eriously, the noble Princess Elena disappears somewhere near the war-ravaged front lines.

    <p><span>Elena dances her way across the grasslands.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,580 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released the gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Elena, who is due out on June 5 alongside the launch of its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/street-fighter-6-coming-to-switch-2-on-june-5-alongside-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Switch 2 version and Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>. <span id="more-961234"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>As a returning fan favorite of the series, players’ spirits will rise for Elena as she brings her unique moveset inspired by capoeira, a Brazilian martial art and dance form that blends martial arts, dance, music and acrobatics combined with the modern touches of <em>Street Fighter 6</em> mechanics. Elena also brings a brand new stage, Reniala Remains, which showcases the plains of Africa at night as wildlife roam in the background, all lit by the glowing <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a> above. Players will need to keep up with Elena as she dances across all three game modes including World Tour, Fighting Ground, and Battle Hub.</p><p>The pure-spirited Elena showcases her kicker moves with two colorful Outfits. Outfit 1 is themed around her newest look, creating a fresh yet familiar style that emphasizes both her grace and physique, while Outfit 2 is an ode to her iconic look in <em>Street Fighter III: New Generation</em> and <em>Ultra Street Fighter IV</em>. Outfit 2 can be acquired by maxing out your bond with her in World Tour or via Fighter Coins.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961245"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Elena’s moveset uses her long legs and unpredictable movements to keep her prey in check, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rhino Horn</strong> – A series of quick, forward-moving kicks that send the opponent flying back</li><li><strong>Scratch Wheel</strong> – Known as Elena’s “dragon-punch,” this move is useful for anti-airs or for keeping opponents away</li><li><strong>Lynx Song</strong> – Where things get wild, Elena spins forward close to the ground while invincible to projectiles and can then use four different techniques out of it, such as Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash or Lynx Whirl.<ul><li><strong>Leopard Snap</strong> – A long-reaching attack useful for closing distances</li><li><strong>Harvest Circle</strong> -: A kick that launches opponents in the air and maintains invincibility to projectiles</li><li><strong>Mallet Smash</strong> – An overhead kick that can buffalow-profile</li><li><strong>Lynx Whirl</strong> – Elena performs an additional spin to extend Lynx Song. If the aforementioned Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, or Mallet Smash are performed after Lynx Whirl, their properties are “boosted!”</li></ul></li><li><strong>Spinning Scythe</strong> – As seen in previous iterations, perform a series of spinning kicks that can be canceled and followed up with Leopard Snap, Harvest Circle, Mallet Smash, and Lynx Whirl, to keep up the pressure on her opponents</li><li><strong>Moon Glider</strong> – An evasive technique where Elena steps back before performing a vertical spinning kick that sends the opponent in the air</li><li><strong>Meteor Volley</strong> – Elena’s Level 1 Super Art that operates as an effective anti-air move and also allows for a follow-up attack.</li><li><strong>Revival Dance</strong> – Elena’s Level 2 Super Art where she launches forward with a flurry of kicks and is invincible to all attacks on start-up. If you hold the down button, rather than dealing extra damage, Elena will do her trademark healing!</li><li><strong>Song of the Grasslands</strong> – Elena’s Level 3 Super Art brings the power of nature to the fight as she delivers kicks with the power of the skies and plains!</li></ul><p>Finally, a major balance patch will come to <em>Street Fighter 6</em> when Elena launches, introducing changes for all of the previous 25 characters along with some broader system changes as well. Keep an eye out for the detailed patch notes as we head toward Elena’s launch!</p></blockquote><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> vis <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.
