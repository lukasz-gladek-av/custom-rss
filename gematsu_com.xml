        <p><strong>LightSpeed Studios Sets the Stage for a New Era for LightSpeed Japan Studio</strong></p><p>Building on this approach, legendary game director and head of LightSpeed Japan Studio, Hideaki Itsuno, is revealing at GDC 2025 that he’s entering the arena and embarked on the early stages of bringing his own visionary AAA game title to life. Drawing on his extensive experience directing games and building incredible teams at <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> that drove the remarkable successes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, the Capcom <em>Alpha</em> series, <em>Capcom VS. <a title="Companies > SNK Corporation [412 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/snk">SNK</a></em>, and many more iconic game titles, Itsuno is ready to apply the same principles of creative freedom, efficiency, and humility to assemble an outstanding team and create something truly groundbreaking.</p><p>“We’re building a creative environment that combines diverse cultural perspectives with cutting-edge technology,” said LightSpeed Japan Studio general manager Hideaki Itsuno. “Our focus is on developing gameplay elements that offer players entirely new experiences—the kind of innovations that make players say I’ve never seen that in a game before.”</p><p><strong>Leveraging Global Talent and Nurturing Creative Freedom</strong></p><p>Additionally, to foster fresh perspectives in original game development, LightSpeed Studios is adopting a model that enables each studio to shape its own culture, advocating for original thinking within teams. Bringing to the table Eastern and Western game philosophies, LightSpeed Studios is positioned to encourage regional teams to exchange ideas, blend cultural influences, and unite under a shared vision—creating truly global gaming experiences.</p><p>A standout example of this approach is being led by the vice president of LightSpeed Studios, Steve C. Martin, known for his commitment to five-year development cycles. Focused on bringing his original AAA open world action title, Last Sentinel, to life, Steve has assembled a world-class, global team. Despite talent from prestigious studios like Rockstar Games, Meta and EA Games, LightSpeed LA has fostered not only a culture of creative freedom but ensures product efficiency, thanks to Steve’s emphasis on humility and a willingness to embrace constructive feedback.</p><p>“Any game studio’s ambition lies with developing original games,” said Martin. “The creative freedom of creating your own lore from scratch, building a compelling narrative, and all the upsides from this is the dream of any studio, and that’s why LightSpeed Studios is the place to be.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
