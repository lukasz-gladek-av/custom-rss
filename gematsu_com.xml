The game design and gradually UI change in reflection of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s.</p><p>The steampunk-style artwork and the character animations were all handled by a single animator.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>“Nice to meet you… again?”</em></p><p>An android named “Eve” speaks to “you,” before a headless corpse apparently known as “The Professor.”</p><p>Completely devoid of any sort of memory, “you,”　together with “Eve”—an android, and the Professor’s apparent killer—must uncover the truth of what really happened here.</p><p>Use your powers of deduction to unravel the mystery of this sealed laboratory, one revelation after another.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this all-new type of mystery – the kind that’s only possible with video games.</p><p><strong>Characters Depicted in Beautiful Hand-Drawn Animation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Main Character</strong> – Has no idea who they are due to total amnesia. Somewhat unreliable.</li><li><strong>Eve</strong> – An android. As the main character regains consciousness, Eve is standing before the corpse of “the Professor”. The heroine, and also the prime suspect.</li><li><strong>The Professor</strong> – Eve’s creator. Found as a headless corpse upon the main character’s awakening.</li><li><strong>Kel</strong> – An integrated discipline interface. Something like an AI that punishes people for their <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es, but which for some reason speaks like a little girl and can be quite agitating.</li></ul><p><strong>User Interface and Game Design that Change Along with Game Progress</strong></p><p>The user interface and game design in general change in accordance with your game progress.</p><p>The story and UI come together, and the general game design gradually transforms, providing an all-new, almost magic trick-like game experience.</p><p><strong>Main Staff and Comments</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scenario: Van Madoy</strong> (known for <em>Revoir</em> series, “Murder at Kogetsukan” in <em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>) – At the beginning of the project, I thought, “Is there even anything left for me to do in the world of mystery games that my predecessors haven’t already done themselves?” However, as development progressed, I reconsidered and thought, “Maybe I can realize the ideal mystery via the medium of video games.” The concept of this game is “a mystery that can be solved over and over again.” I hope you enjoy the experience of solving the kind of mystery that is only possible with video games—one that’s sort of different from other “multi-ending” games.</li><li><strong>Direction / Development: EIKI’</strong> (known for <em>GENSOU Skydrift</em>, <em>Living in the Ending World</em>) – I consider the adventure genre to actually be a no-rules, cross-species battle. We bring you an all-new breakthrough adventure worthy of its striking visuals and writing.</li><li><strong>Character Design / Animation: Yutaro</strong> (known for <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm7905073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Tegaki</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm27209687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Youyoumu: The Maximum Moving About</em></a>) – What’s the point of using hand-drawn animation to express characters in games, especially in adventure-style stand-up fashion? Well, I’d like to give any answer other than “This is the only way I can!,” so let’s say it’s that I’m striving to depict my art in a way that shows the pleasure and rawness of animation in an adventurelayout.</li><li><strong>Sound: RD-Sounds (Diao Ye Zong)</strong> (known for “Sacrament (Vatican Miracle Examiner ED),” “Absolute One-way Street ~Unreachable Message~ (<em>Touhou Project</em> Arrangement Track)”) – A story is, after all, a combination of pictures, sounds, and stories. Game scenes, controls, background music, sound effects, story, visuals… I want to find out just what I can do using sound to fuse all of these elements together in order to tell a “story” in a game.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Short Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); Short Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBvUUvyRV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); （エデン・スキマータ）Short PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7J5t311GPkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
