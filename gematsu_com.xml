The Digiverse is a brand-new expedition map, available once players start the second star in Memento Mile. Each rift holds new Points of Interest (POIs), exhibits, decorations, and more. So, dust off your explorer’s hat because it’s time to go digging through gaming history and dredging up secrets from the deep.</p><p>In an exciting new crossover with Black Salt Games’ fishing <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,518 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em>DREDGE</em>, players can uncover a wealth of mysterious content in Two Point Museum when they venture out to the shadowy waters in the <em>DREDGE</em> rift. Explore three remote POIs across The Grey Isles, haul in ten new catches, unlock new aquarium décor, and kit out your team with fresh staff outfits. But watch the waters – daytime fishing is fine, nighttime is… unwise. Oh, and don’t look too closely at the Aberration Fish…</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_988786"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Players start their Digiverse adventure with the <em>Meat Wizard</em> rift, where they will be transported inside Two Point County’s favorite videogame series <em>Meat Wizard</em>, where Digital Experts uncover video game history. Four POIs await, brimming with retro exhibits, quirky décor, and interactive displays that are equal parts magical and questionable in design. Players can hire Experts to craft Power-Ups. These special items are crafted in the workshop and provide powerful bonuses when placed around your museum, meaning bigger, better, and bolder ways to impress your guests and of course, boost donations.</p><p>Alongside the new content, the Free Update also brings new language support to Two Point Museum. In their aim to make Two Point games accessible to more players, Two Point Studios has now added Latin-American Spanish, Thai and Russian language support to the game. The Free Update also offers players a bunch of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes and optimization changes.</p></blockquote><p>A full overview of all content and improvements can be found in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2185060/view/545618256387375629" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</p><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,263 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,817 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,112 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, and is coming to Switch 2 in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
