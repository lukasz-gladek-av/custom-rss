We are using our own proprietary Intellectual Camera System—designed to find the most cinematic angles for the action on screen without interrupting gameplay—as well as embracing bold camera choices, including the use of pre-set cameras in certain scenes. Many of these decisions are inspired by iconic moments from classic action films. Players may spot some homages to scenes from <em>John Wick Chapter 4</em> and <em>Old Boy</em> in today’s teaser.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nekki:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>SPINE</em> is a single-player, story-rich action game where the player takes on the role of rebellious street artist Redline, accompanied by her sentient combat implant, Spine. Players join them as they challenge the autocratic AI regime of Tensor Corporation while learning to trust each other.</p><p><em>SPINE</em> features camerawork and combat choreography by action movie stunt specialists and is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and Nekki’s original animation engine, Cascadeur, making players the star of their own action movie where no two fights are the same.</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.</p><p>And that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it… she can’t…</p><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is a game from the team at Ivy Road, including Davey Wreden (creator of <em>The Stanley Parable</em> and <em>The Beginner’s Guide</em>), Karla Zimonja (co-creator of <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Tacoma</em>) and Daniel “C418” Rosenfeld (the music of Minecraft).</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

His luck changes when he discovers Rapidium, a resource that, when paired with the Quantum Computer, lets him create Alters—alternate versions of himself based on changing the pivotal decisions from his past.</p><p>The Alters aren’t just workers—they’re individuals with their own skills, emotions, and motivations. While essential for keeping the base functional, crafting tools, and mining resources, their distinct personalities can spark tension. Despite their differences, they share a common goal: survive, escape, and rely only on themselves.</p><p>The game explores the timeless question: “What if I had chosen differently?” This core theme fuels a deeply personal and thought-provoking narrative as players navigate Jan’s struggle for survival.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
