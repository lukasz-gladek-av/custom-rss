A supply drop to an Alaskan town, auto-pilot on, guard down. You and Donovan were already planning post mission drinks when it happened.</p><p>The storm.</p><p>Half the plane disappeared in a flash. Donovan was gone, lost to the howling tempest. Waking from the crash, you find yourself alone, trapped in a frozen wilderness, your only companions a court-mandated therapy bot and temperatures that can cut a man to shreds. Hope for survival lies in finding your friend and maybe a way home.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are Kai, a pilot without a plane, lost in the wilderness of the far north. You’ll need your wits about you to brave the elements, find your co-pilot and get the hell out of Dodge.
