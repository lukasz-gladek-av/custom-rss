Each 5 minute phase can bestow buffs, debuffs, summon power monsters or change rules on at moment’s notice</li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – Choose between a lighter, fun and casual player-versus-environment experience or hardcore competitive player-versus-environment-versus-player dungeon run modes to suit your style and do so with teammates or solo.</li><li><strong>Play as Unique Stalkers</strong> – Select from a roster of vivid, story-driven characters with diverse abilities and discover the story behind why each of them has found themselves here and unfold the secrets to the dungeon itself!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dungeon-stalkers-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-on-august-13]]></content:encoded>
