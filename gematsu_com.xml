It is inspired by <em>The <a title="Games > Outer Wilds [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a></em>. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622350/Kill_Joy/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1011396"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622350/Kill_Joy/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A systems-driven exploration game where foul language is your only tool—and the world reacts in ways you’d never expect. Escape a deceptive nightmare of rainbows and unicorns by making its happy creatures cry.</p><p><strong>A Genre With No Name</strong></p><p><em>Kill Joy</em> is an experiment in complex systems design where a single interaction (swearing) can produce many consequences. That also means that because exploring the rules of the system is the fun part, we won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to make sense of this insane world yourself.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Swearing is Not Combat—It’s How You Explore</strong></p><p>In <em>Kill Joy</em>, you don’t shoot, punch, or cast spells. You swear.</p><p>Swearing at creatures is how you interact with this world. Sometimes a creature laughs, sometimes it panics, and sometimes it weeps—and when it cries, the illusion breaks. Every reaction is a mechanical clue. Every rude word is a probe into the rules of a place that desperately wants you happy, calm, and blind.</p><p><strong>A Pastoral Hell</strong></p><p>On the surface, this world is a manic dream of rainbow meadows, talking bunnies, and friendly unicorns. Underneath, something is very wrong:</p><ul><li>Happy creatures with glossy, empty eyes.</li><li>Joyful clouds humming in unsettling harmony.</li><li>Perfect little critters who desperately want you to smile.</li></ul><p>You know better. You can feel something gnawing at the edges.</p><p><strong>Break the Illusion</strong></p><p>Some illusions are “anchored” to certain entities. Their happiness is a spell holding reality together. Make them cry, and the spell cracks. Behind each illusion is something real:</p><ul><li>Hidden passages.</li><li>Suppressed memories.</li><li>Twisted, half-digested hints left by previous victims.</li><li>And the scattered fragments of your own mind.</li></ul><p><strong>Reassemble Your Mind</strong></p><p>Your mind has been shattered and projected outward onto the landscape. Each dispelled illusion yields:</p><ul><li>A word.</li><li>A question.</li><li>A fragment of meaning.</li></ul><p>Piece them together through small, elegant deduction challenges. Rebuild the logic of your thinking. Recover your identity. Find out what’s eating you—and why.</p><p>If you’re tired of games that tell you what to feel, where to go, and how to think…</p><p>If you want something genuinely new…</p><p>If you’re ready to swear at a unicorn until reality fractures—.</p><p>Welcome to <em>Kill Joy</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="You've NEVER played a game like this." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M4THd1pA3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/systems-driven-exploration-game-kill-joy-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

Many landed on Earth. Since then, magic is real, myths have moved in, and the fabled live side by side with humans in relative peace. Present day and the rifts are back… but this time they bring sinister threats into our world. You and your friends team up as the new generation of fabled citizens whose forgotten powers are awakened by the return of the rifts—you must master your emerging and growing magical abilities to fight the invasion and save the city you now call home.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What genre is it?</strong><ul><li>The game genre is online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [649 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> cooperative action. The genre for the setting is urban fantasy. It blends and deconstructs fantasy and folklore, twisting them into a brand new reality set in London. It’s a familiar backdrop intertwined with fantastical wonder, delivering a sense of newness and nostalgia, discovery and familiar favorites. It’s fantasy in a modern jacket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the core gameplay loop?</strong><ul><li>Squads of players face overwhelming enemies and supernatural threats, creating high-stakes cooperative moments where success depends on teamwork. Run-based missions call upon players to employ their fluid magical traversal and visceral spell-casting to defeat threats that stand between them and their objectives. Players will utilize tight combat, special moves, team synergies, tag-team casting and team-up moves to save the city from invasion or liberate occupied districts.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Is it <a title="Genres > Open-World [784 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>?</strong><ul><li>It’s not open-world. We want every district, every street, and every corner to be filled with fun activities and encounters. Using wide-linear maps, we balance large urban playgrounds, which are ripe for player-driven chaos and emergent gameplay, with scripted set-pieces that deliver boss-like encounters and epic moments, set against iconic backgrounds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the maximum number of players?</strong><ul><li>Currently, the game supports two-to-four players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Are there player-versus-player modes?</strong><ul><li>At this time, we are focused on delivering the best player-versus-environment experience, but in the future, we look forward to opening up more modes and different ways to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Can I play single player?</strong><ul><li>No. We have an ambition to deliver an uncompromising, true cooperative experience where players are not simply side by side but connected by the gameplay. The nature of our design is that you need at least one teammate to amplify your powers. It’s a playground for you, your friends and the community.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What platforms are you supporting?</strong><ul><li>We believe in a cross-platform ecosystem and plan to release <em>Cast Outs</em> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series. In the post-launch growth phase, we will explore opportunities to publish <em>Cast Outs</em> on Switch 2.</li></ul></li><li><strong>How much will it cost?</strong><ul><li><em>Cast Outs</em> is a mid-tier, premium game with a price that is yet to be determined.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When do you plan to launch?</strong><ul><li>We are entering production soon and plan to release an early access beta in early 2027.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Will a public demo be available?</strong><ul><li>We plan to release a playable demo to the public soon and eagerly await the opportunity to put the game into more players’ hands. Some decisions we have to make include platform strategy, cross play support, input devices, and language support, whilst we also continue working on optimization, hardware compatibility, bug fixing, and store / platform compliance.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
