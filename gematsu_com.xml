The sneak peek also introduces new characters who play key roles in the swordplay action game’s narrative. </p><p>After protagonist Miyamoto Musashi’s arrival in Kyoto, the samurai is ambushed by the demonic Genma. On the verge of death, Musashi is “gifted” an Oni Gauntlet granting him the power to stand against these monstrosities from the underworld. However, as a warrior who wishes to carve a path by his own hand, he seeks to sever his link with this mystical artifact.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_994865"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>During Musashi’s journey, he encounters Izumo no Okuni and Ono no Takamura, newfound friends who are also based on real figures from Japanese history. Guided by the voice of the mysterious Oni woman within his gauntlet, Musashi is led to Takamura, a venerable swordsman with a gauntlet of his own. He also crosses paths with Okuni, a famous performer known for her iconic Kabuki dance, who has departed the stage in search of a way to defeat the Genma. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The latest footage also contains flashes of gameplay where Musashi faces enemies in the streets of Kyoto, including Togemaru, a serpentine Genma with spikes running down its spine that whirls into the fray with great speed to eviscerate its unfortunate targets. Though Musashi is reluctant to embrace his Oni Gauntlet, he must harness its power to slay such formidable foes. </p></blockquote><p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,435 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,955 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2638890/Onimusha_Way_of_the_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.
