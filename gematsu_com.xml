The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>stones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.</p><p>Now 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,480 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!</p><p>The original <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song</em> included many of the <em>SaGa</em> series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded high-definition graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the <em>SaGa</em> series.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Brand new localization in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. (English also included.)</li><li>Full high-definition graphical update.</li><li>Schiele, Marina, Monica, and Flammar can now be recruited.</li><li><a title="Companies > Enhance [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d and more difficult bosses.</li><li>High speed mode.</li><li>Mini Maps.</li><li>New Game+ mode.</li></ul><p><strong>■ Staff Comments</strong></p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>anori Ichikawa, <em>SaGa</em> Series Producer</strong></p><p>“When I was thinking about how I wanted to share this treasured game series with players overseas, Red Art Games approached me, and I truly felt their deep love for <em>SaGa</em>. That was the beginning of this project. And now, I am delighted to announce that the release date has been set for December 9, 2025. This has been made possible thanks to the dedication of many people and the passionate voices of <em>SaGa</em> fans around the world. From the bottom of my heart, thank you very much.”</p><p><strong>Hiroyuki Miura, <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered</em> Producer</strong></p><p>“The release date for <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered International</em> has been announced.
