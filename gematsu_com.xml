However, during that trip, she encounters a murder incident and is subsequently arrested as a suspect. While being transported in a police vehicle, it suddenly overturns in an accident, freeing Mika along with six other criminals and they all become fugitives.</p><p><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious attackers appear, targeting the unique “power” that Mika possesses, and the group finds themselves pursued by both the police and the attackers. The secret hidden within Mika’s power, the identity of the attackers, and the truth behind the murder incident that started it all…</p><p>Can they unravel these mysteries and reclaim a normal life?</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Choices</strong> – During your escape, you will be forced to make various choices. Your choices will affect the “likability” of the other character and the protagonist’s own “criminality,” which will affect the development of the story and the ending.</li><li><strong>Sidecar Part</strong> – During the escape, you can choose who will drive the motorcycle on which the main character rides in the sidecar. By choosing your partner, you can discover an unexpected side of them and deepen your bond.</li><li><strong>Mission Mode</strong> – During the story, you may encounter mission modes that require cooperation from all your allies, such as stealing important items or escaping from a building. In mission mode, you will watch footage from six separate security cameras and give appropriate instructions to your allies according to the situation to lead the mission to success.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ash Meyer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Suzuki) – A young man who abandoned his hometown, and is always on the move from place to place. He prefers to be alone, and does his best to avoid speaking to others. The quiet lone wolf. Due to his surly appearance, he’s constantly getting involved in fights, leading a life of never ending violence. He likes to drive vehicles, and has a particularly strong attachment to motorcycles. He has amazing driving technique, but with how wild his driving is, it’s a miracle he hasn’t been in an accident.</li><li><strong>Hamiel Luis</strong> (voiced by Kazuki Kato) – A con man with the air of a playboy. Although he’s good with people, and excels at manipulating people’s minds with his eloquent words, his sarcasm and sharp words often bleed into his speech. Due to his strong self assertion, he often gets himself into trouble with other people. He also excels at disguising himself, and cheating when gambling.</li><li><strong>Gib Baltzer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Takeuchi) – A former police officer who’s on the run as a suspect for the murder of a colleague. As a member of the special force in his time as a police officer, he was a sniper who excels at handling firearms. Always calm and collected, he fills the role of leader of the group. He can make decisions from an objective point of view, but due to his serious personality, he often can’t relate to younger people. He was married once, but is now a widower.</li><li><strong>Ramie Carriere</strong> (voiced by Yuto Uemura) – The self proclaimed, “Ramie, the Great Phantom Thief of the Century,” he’s a thief who mainly targets the wealthy. Excels at both picking pockets and picking locks with his dexterous fingers. He also makes great use of his acrobatic skills, using his cat-like agility to get over walls. He’s friendly, always looking to brighten up the mood, but hates being touched by other people.</li><li><strong>Camu Einhard</strong> (voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana) – Calling himself “The Earth Warrior of Love,” he’s a revolutionist who fights for the preservation of the environment. An engineering student who loves Japanese comics, he has a strong interest in Japanese culture and anime. In addition to always being immersed in his own world, due to his social anxiety, he doesn’t have any friends his age. He is pure of heart, and he generally doesn’t like arguments.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > Sally [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sally">Sally</a> Del Testa</strong> (voiced by Kanae Ito) – A genius hacker who loves Japan’s Harajuku fashion. Gaining illegal access to information through the net, she has committed numerous cyber crimes, but having no sense of the wrongness of her <a title="Genres > Action [2,722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, she doesn’t like to be called a cracker. Because of an incident in her past, she avoids elevators.</li><li><strong>Mika Amamine</strong> (default name) (voiced by Mika Okamoto) – <em>Despera Drop</em>‘s protagonist. She’s a Japanese student studying abroad at an Italian University. She gets involved in a murder incident in Rome, and is framed as the murderer and arrested. A good person at heart, who doesn’t forgive bad deeds, she is reluctant to live on the run as a fugitive. Having the power to read people’s strong emotions and memories when she touches them with her hands from birth, she always wears gloves to avoid reading people’s hearts inadvertently.</li></ul><p><em>*Only the name of the main character can be changed. (If you use the default name, the character will call you by your name with a voice.)</em><br><em>*Character voicing is in Japanese only.</em></p><p><strong>Steam Version Contents</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Supports Switching Between Japanese and English</strong> – You can switch between Japanese and English at any time from the settings screen. The language will only change in the scenario, user interface, and on-screen effects; the audio will remain in Japanese.</li><li><strong>Postscript Episodes Included as Extra Content</strong> – The Nintendo Switch version (Japanese version) includes seven additional episodes that were previously sold as downloadable content as extra content. These episodes take place after the happy endings of each character route, so please enjoy them after completing the game.</li><li><strong>Supports Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller Operation</strong> – Players can choose their preferred input devices—keyboard, mouse, or controller—to suit their playing environment (multiple combinations are also possible).
