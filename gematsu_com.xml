      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released new footage, screenshots, and information for <em><a title="Games > PRAGMATA [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pragmata">PRAGMATA</a></em>, introducing the game’s story and combat. <span id="more-976411"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Capcom Spotlight provided a more detailed look at PRAGMATA featuring new details about the game’s sci-fi story and the first extended footage of its unique <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-packed gameplay.</p><p><em>PRAGMATA</em> takes place in the near future. In the years since the discovery of Lunam Ore, humanity has developed Lunafilament, a material capable of replicating almost anything. One day without warning, Earth lost contact with the lunar research station dedicated to this Lunafilament, as all signals went dark.</p><p>Today’s footage delves deeper into this out-of-this-world adventure. The journey follows Hugh Williams, who is dispatched to the moon as part of a team to investigate what happened. When a lunar quake suddenly strikes the facility, Hugh is separated from his team, injured, and knocked unconscious. In this moment, he’s rescued by an enigmatic Pragmata, a unique android created using Lunafilament, who has the appearance of a young girl. As the unlikely duo joins forces to fend off the station’s rampaging bots, Hugh nicknames his newfound companion “Diana,” and they embark on a mission to escape the lunar station and return to Earth.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_976420"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In <em>PRAGMATA</em>, Hacking and shooting are at the core of gameplay. During combat, a panel will appear on screen while aiming at enemies. This represents Diana’s ability to hack into foes’ defenses. By maneuvering the cursor through this panel, she can take down their armor and provide openings for Hugh to blast enemy weak points with his arsenal of weapons. This system will challenge players to think on the fly to overcome multisided situations in the heat of battle.</p><p>Exploration is also a team effort. Diana can utilize her Hacking abilities outside of combat to access the facility’s systems and remove environmental barriers that block progress. Meanwhile, Hugh can make use of his suit’s thrusters to traverse the lunar station’s terrain. By combining their skills and abilities, they can achieve feats that would be impossible alone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for <em>PRAGMATA</em> is now fully open. Alongside new information about the game, the site includes a “Hacking Minigame” allowing players to experience part of the game’s unique combat system before <em>PRAGMATA</em> launches. Before then, the game will be playable at Gamescom 2025 and other events.</p></blockquote><p><em>PRAGMATA</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,819 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,474 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,589 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3357650/PRAGMATA/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the <em>PRAGMATA</em> segment of today’s Capcom Spotlight below.

    <p><span>A game fueled by "addictive fear," with horror at its core.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released an eight-minute “Creators’ Message” developer diary for <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil Requiem [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em>, featuring director Koshi Nakanishi, art director Tomonori Takano, and producers <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>achika Kawata and Masato Kumazawa, who provide deeper insight into the anticipated sequel. <span id="more-976410"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>The development team of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>—the ninth and most immersive mainline entry yet in the iconic <a title="Genres > Survival [433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [654 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> <em>Resident Evil</em> series—shared all-new details on the upcoming game, set to frighten fans when it releases. Director Koshi Nakanishi, art director Tomonori Takano, and producers Masachika Kawata and Masato Kumazawa explain that players can look forward to a game fueled by “addictive fear,” with horror at the heart of its gameplay.</p><p>The development team also revealed more details on the series’ newest protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, an FBI intelligence analyst who is introverted and easily scared, introducing a new type of character for the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. Grace will experience horror from the same perspective as the player as she learns to overcome her fears throughout the course of the story. Though timid, she’s also trained with firearms and uses deductive reasoning to stay calm under pressure.</p><p>The team has also gone to great lengths to deliver an unprecedented level of realism, down to minute character details like the redness of Grace’s face as she’s hanging upside down, and the natural movement of her hair, modeled in part using a custom-made wig as reference.</p><p>As shared previously, players will be able to freely switch between both first- and third-person perspectives throughout the game. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the horror up close and personal with tense, realistic gameplay in first-person perspective, or use the over-the-shoulder camera with third-person perspective that allows you to create a more <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-heavy gameplay experience.</p><!-- AD: content -->
