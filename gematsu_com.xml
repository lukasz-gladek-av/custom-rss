    <p><span>Bandai Namco following an "announce and release what's ready quickly" approach.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>A <em><a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> Xillia 2</em> remaster is underway, and the announcement of the next remastered <em>Tales of</em> game is expected relatively soon, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa said in the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu. <span id="more-1001196"></span></p><p>“We’ve formed teams with several partner development companies, and including projects from the verification stage to the late development stage, there are more than two titles in progress,” Tomizawa said in an interview celebrating the upcoming release of <em><a title="Games > Tales of Xillia Remastered [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-xillia-remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a></em>. “The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Asked if that means the next remastered project will be announced soon, Tomizawa said, “I’m unfortunately unable to provide specifics about the next title yet. But the timing of the next remastered title announcement should be relatively soon… or at least, that’s the plan.”</p><p>As for a remastered <em>Tales of Xillia 2</em>, Tomizawa said, “As mentioned earlier, we’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced. We will do our best to deliver updates as quickly as possible.”</p><p>While there has not been a brand-new entry in the <em>Tales of</em> series since 2021’s <em><a title="Games > Tales of Arise [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise</a></em>, which received a post-game story expansion called “Beyond the Dawn” in 2023, Tomizawa said, “As the <em>Tales of</em> series development team—as we always have throughout the history of the series—we continue to think about and work on new titles. Any announcements regarding a new title will take some time, but alongside the remasters, we are also planning and considering initiatives such as real-life events, merchandise, and various other promotions. Following the 30th anniversary, through the 40th and 50th, we hope to continue creating opportunities for players and characters to experience and share stories in various forms.”</p><p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246670/Tales_of_Xillia_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on October 31.</p><!-- AD: content -->
