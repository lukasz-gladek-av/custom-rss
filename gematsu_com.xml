In addition, the <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,958 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> weaves the stories of Hercule Poirot and Jane Royce, the new detective, even more closely together.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Microids:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Death on the Nile</em>, a peaceful cruise on the Nile is disrupted by a terrible crime. Thankfully, Hercule Poirot is onboard. Meanwhile, another private detective Jane Royce is tracking a murderer, leading her from London to Majorca, New York, and finally to Egypt. The two investigations collide at Abu Simbel. The dynamic duo will solve a complex case full of twists and turns. But the story doesn’t end with the book and still holds many mysteries and twists, even for Agatha Christie fans.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_934793"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
