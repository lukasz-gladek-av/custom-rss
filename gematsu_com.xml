Using your old camera, you’ll explore an ethereal realm and its ties to the world you left behind, uncover its mysteries, and ultimately find your way home.</p><p>You are a weary, middle-aged photojournalist retreating from a life of disappointment in the city to find solace in your roots. But an unexpected accident leaves you stranded in an ethereal mountain realm, where you cross paths with a mysterious girl. To uncover the truth of this enigmatic world and find a way back home, you must gather clues and piece together its mysteries—all with nothing but the old camera in your hands.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Where do grownups go when they lose their way?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Photography</strong> – Photography in <em>OPUS: Prism Peak</em> reflects how closely the protagonist looks at the world. Players must take in their surroundings, understand what each spirit desires, and capture the realm’s secrets through their lens. Capture the moment, then learn to let go.</li><li><strong>Companionship</strong> – Among the spirits is a girl with no memory of who she is, only a faint sense that she needed to help a grownup through his struggles. As their journey unfolds, her presence offers a different angle that helps him see the world more clearly. It’s nice that you came along at a time like this.</li><li><strong>Wistful Magical Realism</strong> – This world is not unlike reality, yet it is slowly fading away. Humanity has long since vanished, leaving only animal spirits to inhabit its remains. They believe that so long as they capture each other’s moments, they will continue to exist.</li><li><strong>Spiritual Bonds</strong> – The spirits you encounter throughout the game may grow closer to you depending on your choices, quietly shaping what awaits at your destination.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
