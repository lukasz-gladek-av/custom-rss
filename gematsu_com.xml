Now, your university Mystery Research Club is prying open old wounds while revisiting this unsolved case.</p><p>Take on the role of first year college student Doppo <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>zawa who has joined the Mystery Research Club. Their first research assignment leads them to Narumizawa to investigate the 30-year-old murder case of a famous landscape artist. Though irregularities were found and the primary suspect died in an apparent suicide, the case was closed. However, Doppo possesses something that those in charge thirty years ago didn’t have; the power to travel back in time. Unexpected new clues are revealed as you use your secret ability to peer into the past, viewing key items and events in a new light. Use your uniquely gained knowledge to steer conversations and interviews with witnesses and potential suspects. Maintain your own secrets while uncovering a series of long-buried clues leading to the true killer.</p><p>Structured like a TV drama, each chapter in <em>Path of Mystery: A Brush with Death</em> is presented in the form of an episode. The tension builds as you begin to draw key information from everyone connected to the murder 30 years ago. The game world is brought to life by a talented cast of voice actors, great character designs and beautiful backgrounds, with the retrocognition portions taking players back to the past with a retro art style.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
