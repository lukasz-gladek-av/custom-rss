Immerse yourself in deep focus while listening to high-quality music from talented sound artists.</li><li><strong>A Wide Variety of Nature Sounds to Awaken Your Instincts</strong> – Sometimes, it’s best to turn off the music and listen to the soothing sounds of nature. Let the sound of wind, rain, and other natural elements sharpen your senses and create a deeply immersive work environment.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        Customize the ambient sounds to suit your preferences.</li><li><strong>Pomodoro Timer for Maximum Productivity</strong> – Set up a Pomodoro timer before you start working to manage your break times effectively.

Strong and selfless, Kaser shies away from the label of a hero, feeling the weight of those who depend on his abilities and leadership. Unyielding in his defiance against oppression, he fights for those who cannot stand up for themselves, fuelled by a steadfast resolve to save his home from the cruel reign of brutal tyrants. Now the fate of his beloved sister hangs in the balance as he seeks to exact a terrible revenge on Aramon and the invading Voidrax.</li><li><strong>Arena</strong> – Once a powerful alien-dragon warrior, Arena exudes a commanding aura of authority that demands respect. It was in witnessing the true depths of human love and kindness that he realized humanity was not the evil species he had always believed it to be. Now haunted by the memories of his past actions in conquering innocent worlds alongside his Voidrax brethren, Arena’s future is clouded and his motivations remain unclear. <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> his strong and domineering presence lies a wise and compassionate soul, capable of offering help and guidance to those who need it the most, with a dose of dry humour even in the most dangerous situations.</li><li><strong>Louisa</strong> – Kaser’s sweet-natured younger sister always prioritizes the wellbeing of others and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her friends and family from harm. Growing up in Slum Harbour left an imprint on the teenager and deeply shaped her character, instilling a great deal of loyalty and empathy for its people who have long suffered under the harsh and oppressive rule of the Empire. Despite her overly protective older brother’s concerns, Louisa joined the GLIMMER resistance group, determined to make Slum Harbour a happier and safer place to live. Her genuine compassion, respect and kindness have earned her the heartfelt gratitude of the townsfolk.</li><li><strong>Aramon</strong> – The ruthless commander of the Voidrax has been imprisoned across alternative dimensions for a millennium—but is executing a meticulous escape plan that threatens to unleash catastrophic consequences. Consumed by an insatiable obsession to dominate all of existence, he intends to seize the planet’s Life Nexus—a move that could grant him nearly limitless power. His vengeance against those who imprisoned him will be swift, brutal and merciless, leaving devastation in his wake. Manipulative, narcissistic and arrogant, he holds others in utter contempt, believing that the time for his ultimate rule has finally arrived.</li><li><strong>Victor</strong> – As the noble leader of the Holy Order, bound by a solemn oath to protect the weak and the innocent, Victor embodies the virtues of a true hero. His unwavering loyalty to the Empire and his firm belief in the Emperor’s vision for a brighter, more prosperous future drive him forward. A paragon of honor, integrity and courage, Victor is unafraid of telling hard truths for the greater good of the country, the people and the Empire he loves deeply.</li><li><strong>Zana</strong> – A natural born leader with extraordinary superhuman abilities, Zana joined GLIMMER upon understanding the oppressive nature and formidable power of the Empire. Now a vital member of the organization, she constantly strives for excellence and manages to display strength, calm and pure emotional control, even when challenged with terrible adversity. Preferring to work alone, Zana often keeps others at arm’s length, making her seem cold and distant, and carefully considers her next move before acting.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight for Everything</strong> – Simple to grasp, challenging to perfect.
