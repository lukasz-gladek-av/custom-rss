Along the way, Phyre is haunted and guided by the voice of Fabien, a Malkavian detective whose fractured perception of reality offers both insight and unease.</p><p>The story continues with the Story Packs, each centering on a key Camarilla character from Phyre’s journey: Sheriff Benny and Primogen Ysabella. These packs deepen Phyre’s story and reveal Seattle’s World of Darkness through their eyes, offering fresh insights into their motivations and new angles on the city’s hidden power struggles.</p><p>Players can choose one of six clans in the base game, each with its own distinct playstyles, outfits, and Disciplines: the rebellious Brujah, blood sorcery masters Tremere, justice-driven Banu Haqim, the persuasive Ventrue, the enthralling Toreador, and the shadow master Lasombra. Players must remain mindful of their surroundings or risk breaking the Masquerade—the absolute law of secrecy that keeps vampire society hidden from humanity.</p></blockquote><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,383 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,915 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,263 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Overview Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-lasombra-and-toreador-clans-to-base-game-overview-trailer]]></content:encoded>
