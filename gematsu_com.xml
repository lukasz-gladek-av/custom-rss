In the summer of their third year in high school, Korone—the lively mood maker who brought the oddballs together—reaches out after a long time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Looking forward to their reunion, they all arrive at the meeting place… or so they thought.</p><p>When they regain consciousness, they find themselves in a small room with no exit. The room is decorated as if themed after <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. In each corner of the square room, there is a chair and a table for each girl, as well as a lovely tea set. And also, long chains that extend from each chair, connected to the collars around the girls’ necks…</p><p>The “reunion” has become a death game—a battle of life and death to settle the past…!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planned and Written by Ryukishi07</strong> – This is the second entry in Entergram’s “Girls Mental Suspense” series, following <em><a title="Games > Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kaleidoscope-of-phantom-prison">Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</a></em>. In this installment, the participants engage in a death game in a new setting.</li><li><strong>A Scenario That Unfolds From Each Character’s Perspective</strong> – In this game, players will experience a game of life and death set in a mysterious room, from the perspective of each character. The story depicts in depth the characters’ inner thoughts as they navigate the game’s challenges, enhancing immersion and exploring their interpersonal relationships.</li><li><strong>Take On Multiple Games</strong> – The previous game, <em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</em>, revolved around a death game with a single rule. This time, multiple games will be featured, ensuring a more varied experience.</li><li><strong>A Fully Voiced Story with an All-Star Cast</strong> – All character dialogue will be fully voiced, with additional voice performances for certain psychological descriptions and other non-dialogue elements. The voice cast will be announced soon, so stay tuned for updates!</li><li><strong>Background Music by HiguUmiSound</strong> – HiguUmiSound, known for composing music for many of Ryukishi07’s works, will once again handle the soundtrack, as it did for <em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison II</em> is due out for PlayStation 4 and Switch on March 14 in Japan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Reimagined in Minter’s signature assault of colors, shapes and sounds, this new take on the eclectic arcade title is built from the ground up with new challenges, new twists, and a whole lot of llamas.</p><p>The premise of <em>I, Robot</em> is simple: You take control of an ox-headed robot on a mission to outwit the all-seeing eye. In each level, you’ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don’t jump while the eye’s watching, or you’ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you’ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter’s kaleidoscopic visualizer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.</p><p>At its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade <a title="Genres > Action [2,473 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each.</li><li>Unique tube-<a title="Genres > Shooter [3,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> bonus stages between each level.</li><li>Llamasoft’s unique brand of mind melting visuals.</li><li>Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score.</li><li>Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
