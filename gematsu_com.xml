    <p><span>10-hour-long expansion due out in early 2026.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > MINTROCKET [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nexon/mintrocket">MINTROCKET</a> has released a new “Developer Dive” video for <em><a title="Games > DAVE THE DIVER [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dave-the-diver">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em>, reflecting on 2025 and sharing studio updates, including a deep dive of information on the downloadable content “In the Jungle,” which is due out in early 2026. <span id="more-1016477"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Downloadable Content “In the Jungle”</strong></p><p>Following the gameplay sneak peek as part of November’s <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Partner Preview, Mintrocket reveals that the next downloadable content—the largest story expansion yet—will launch with approximately 10 hours of content. Much of this new <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> introduces fresh, surprising mechanics and systems that branch boldly away from the base game and previous downloadable contents.</p><p>In “In the Jungle,” Dave heads into freshwater as he embraces new responsibilities and challenges, including befriending the locals of his and a friend’s new home base: a quaint jungle village brimming with opportunity… and just a splash of danger.</p><p><strong>The Village</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to Utara, a jungle village where time flows in real-time. Here, Dave can spend his days freely diving underwater, gathering fruits and resources—and, naturally, building relationships with the locals by completing tasks and side quests.</p><p>As ever, Dave finds himself surrounded by potential friends (and future customers) whose trust and patronage must be earned. As relationships deepen, so too do the rewards, unlocking new opportunities throughout Utara and creating ripple effects that extend all the way to Bancho’s restaurant business.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The Restaurant</strong></p><p>One of “In the Jungle’s” biggest departures from the base game is the introduction of Bancho Grill, a brand-new restaurant in Utara featuring a fully cooked freshwater menu.</p><p>Unlike Bancho Sushi, where movement was limited, Dave can now move freely throughout the Grill, serving customers across multiple areas rather than a single horizontal plane. As Dave’s bonds with villagers grow, they’ll begin visiting Bancho Grill as diners, making the restaurant a key hub, and a vital link, between Dave and the village community.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Systems and Mechanics</strong></p><p>This time around, Dave dives into a massive freshwater lake instead of the Blue Hole—one packed with new aquatic life, unexpected cuisine options, and plenty of lurking danger. New waters demand new tools, and Mintrocket revealed Dave’s latest piece of gear: the Jungle Gun. This versatile weapon can freely transform into net guns, shotguns, snipers, or regular guns, allowing Dave to adapt on the fly and giving players the freedom to experiment with their preferred combat styles.</p><p>Combined with a shift from fully horizontal movement to a more free-flowing isometric view, along with real-time progression, Dave will need to carefully balance priorities and make smarter use of space and time. Expect new minigames with friends, jungle-specific adventures, and a wide variety of activities that benefit Bancho Grill, or Utara as a whole.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■&nbsp;<em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> <a title="Platforms > Mobile [3,087 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/mobile">Mobile</a></strong></p><p>Rounding out today’s Dev Dive, Mintrocket also revealed plans to complete Dave’s multi-platform expedition by bringing the game to mobile platforms together with a partner. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> on mobile won’t be a simple port—instead, the game will be fully optimized and redesigned to perform seamlessly on mobile.

    <p><span>Ye Shunguang's debut, enhanced optimizations, and additional rewards.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “To Be Fuel for the Night,” will launch on December 30, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1016391"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The major update propels Proxies into the culminating chapter of Season 2, introducing the upcoming Void Hunter Ye Shunguang, the popular Zhao, a series of highly anticipated events—including expanded Hollow gameplay and multiplayer combat—and extensive optimizations. To celebrate the new year and express gratitude for the Proxies’ support, Version 2.5 will also grant Proxies a free S-Rank Agent Zhao, 1,000 Polychromes, a new outfit for Jane, and additional rewards.</p><p>Ye Shunguang, the young senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, rises as the first dual-form Void Hunter. With her unique attribute Honed Edge, Ye Shunguang can enter the Enlightened Mind state and activate her signature Ether Veil to unleash massive Honed Edge damage while applying a vulnerability effect to enemies. Accompanying Ye Shunguang is her sidekick Bangboo Sprout, who peppers enemies with volleys of flying swords. Joining them is the unbeaten legend of Krampus, Zhao, who is an S-Rank Ice Defense Agent. Despite her adorable appearance, Zhao weaves swiftly across the battlefield and launches assaults with her massive weapon to suppress enemies. By accumulating Frostbite, Zhao can trigger Ether Veil: Wellspring, granting powerful buffs for the entire squad.</p><p>With strengthened allies, the new chapter unveils the final moments of Waifei Peninsula’s escalating crisis. The legendary Qingming Sword has begun to resonate with the primordial power of the Creator—an overwhelming force that assisted Proxies in past battles but now threatens a profound backlash for Ye Shunguang. Meanwhile, mysterious white flowers—once found only within the Hollows—have begun blooming across Failume Heights, signaling the dangerous expansion of the Lemnian Hollow. Proxies shall venture deep into the Lumite Mine ruins, using their new Perception Technique and teaming up with allies to uncover the truths hidden within the Hollow’s depths.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1016393"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The adventure continues in the epilogue Sword Seeker Chronicles as Proxies support Ye Shunguang in seeking a remedy for the Qingming Sword’s backlash. The investigation showcases Ye Shunguang’s Bladeflash Mirage ability and offers exclusive rewards, including a brand-new W-Engine. Multiplayer combat arrives in the limited-time event Joint Investigation: The Divine Maze, where three-member squads face fast-paced cooperative challenges that reward coordination and tactical timing. Outside combat, the newly added Proxy Outpost allows Proxies to join or create outposts, facilitate discussions, and post or accept commissions, making New Eridu more connected than ever.</p><p>Version 2.5 also introduces quality-of-life updates that refine combat and progression. The existing Agents Soldier 11, Grace, Soldier 0 – Anby, Ellen, and Burnice will be enhanced with updated mechanics and performance boosts, with additional agents in the standard Stable Channel scheduled for future enhancements. Meanwhile, improvements to Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault further polish the gameplay loop, while the new sweep function for Combat Simulation stages lets players consume Ether Batteries to instantly gather promotion materials and Drive Discs, easing the burden of day-to-day progression.</p><p>To welcome both new and returning Proxies, all players can jump directly into Version 2.5’s story through Advance Screening, while expanding their squads with a lineup of limited-time channels. The channels for Ye Shunguang and Zhao will run throughout the entire version, and a special rerun channel in the latter half guarantees the first S-Rank signal obtained will be a selected character among Alice, Soldier 0 – Anby, or Astra, along with their signature W-Engines returning with the same guarantee mechanic.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.5 special program below.
