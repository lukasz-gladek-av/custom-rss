Under Sagat’s rule, a new stage called Proud Spire will be released as well, featuring a calming temple and a peaceful Buddha statue in the background.</p><p>Sagat’s regalia includes two Outfits—Outfit 1 is a newer look featuring a darker Muay Thai-inspired theme, while Outfit 2 is an ode to his <em>Street Fighter II</em> appearance where he dons Muay Thai shorts, plus hand and foot wraps which is common for many Muay Thai practitioners. Outfit 2 can be earned in World Tour by maxing out your bond with Sagat or purchased via Fighter Coins.</p><p>Year 3 Ultimate Pass and Year 3 Character Pass—both of which will unlock Sagat, the three remaining Year 3 characters, including C. Viper, Alex, and Ingrid, plus new Outfit colors and Drive Tickets—are available now for purchase across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, with both passes available for pre-order on Nintendo Switch 2. Content included in the pass will unlock starting when Sagat releases on August 5, 2025.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_978809"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As displayed in the latest trailer, Sagat’s Muay Thai moveset focuses on crushing, hard-hitting blows courtesy of his big frame that also gives him solid kicks with notable physical range, including:</p><ul><li><strong>High Tiger Shot</strong> – Fire a ki blast forward to hit standing opponents, with the blast fired at different speeds depending on the button being pressed.</li><li><strong>Low Tiger Shot</strong> – Fire a ki blast forward that can hit crouching opponents.
