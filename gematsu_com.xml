Day or night, he’ll help however he can, whether that’s by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2006, you’ll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It’s rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings…but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren’t around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Chibi-Robo!</em> Trailer</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->

In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p><p>“The launch of <em>Crimson Desert</em>, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p><p>“The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</p><p><em>Crimson Desert</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,088 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,669 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026]]></content:encoded>
