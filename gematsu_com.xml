One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,591 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support.

Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Neptunia-Trilogy-PS4_04-03-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ‘80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough – except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ‘80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends!
