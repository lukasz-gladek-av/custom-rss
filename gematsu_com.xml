During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom - Console Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDfEOCRXx_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/laysara-summit-kingdom-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch]]></content:encoded>

With a suit armed to the nines, Robot can keep enemies at a distance with his missiles and wrist cannons, while swiftly maneuvering throughout the game using his Beam Blasts and Disruptor to lay on damage. His shoulder cannons unleash deadly homing missiles that force opponents to block in place, granting extra time for Robot to call in assists, set up tech or prepare a mighty assault. Robot can deliver precision laser strikes from long range and call in his hoverbike to stun enemies. Versatile, intelligent and a formidable weapon, Robot is an advanced fighter to have on your team.</p><p><strong>Monster Girl</strong></p><p>Afflicted by a curse, Amanda acquired the extraordinary ability to shift between human form and that of a monster. But this power came at a cost, as each transformation causes her human form to age backward. Undeterred, she proves to be an absolute brute on the battlefield as Monster Girl. Her immense size and strength allow her to tear down opponents, utilizing a combination of grapple attacks, head-spinning hits, in-air blows, body slams and more. And just when her enemies think they’re reaching victory, Monster Girl’s relentless nature allows her to come back even stronger. Boasting dominating power yet technical, combo-driven gameplay, Monster Girl is a brawler you’ll want by your side.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
