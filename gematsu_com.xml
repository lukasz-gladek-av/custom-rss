      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bandai Namco Entertainment [6,821 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> has released a nine-minute overview trailer for <em><a title="Games > Code Vein II [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/code-vein-ii">Code Vein II</a></em>, which features a deep dive on character creation tools, Revenant combat, and an expanded look into the game’s various environments. <span id="more-1018887"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Bandai Namco:</p><blockquote><p>The overview trailer spotlights key features that players will utilize to survive  the post-apocalyptic world in <em>Code Vein II</em>. Combat in the game has been expanded, introducing new depth and strategy through enhanced Drain Attacks, Formae, and the Partner System. Drain Attacks are offensive maneuvers used to extract Ichor, an essential resource that fuels the player’s most powerful abilities. Using this Ichor allows players to unleash powerful attacks called Formae, which includes Weapon Formae that modify attacks and grant buffs, Bequeathed Formae that summon unique weapons for devastating strikes, and Defensive Formae that offer critical blocks, counters, and evasive maneuvers. Jails are specialized artifacts worn on the player’s back and further shape combat by altering stats, modifying Drain Attacks, and providing tactical advantages based on the encounter. </p><p>The trailer also highlights the Restorative Offering, a mechanic where partners can restore the fallen Revenant Hunter with recovered health, though a cooldown leaves them temporarily incapacitated and unable to assist in battle. Newly added to the weapon roster, <em>Code Vein II</em> features the Twin Blades and Rune Blades, joining returning favorites such as the Bayonet, Halberd, Hammer, and Greatsword. These weapon types are supported by the expanded Blood Code system, which allows players to shape their combat style by unlocking and swapping between different Revenant power sets as they progress. Boosters allow players to unlock new key attributes and activate traits tied to Blood Codes and equipment, enabling players to create specialized playstyles.</p><p>Ahead of launch, players can dive into the <em>Code Vein II</em> Character Creator Demo starting on January 23, 2026. Offering 64 save slots that transfer directly into the final game, the Character Creator Demo allows players to experience the game’s deep customization system for the game’s protagonist Revenant Hunter, where players can customize their characters to great detail with a vast array of settings for body type, hairstyle, facial expressions, accessories, makeup and more. Players can also visit the hot spring at the MagMell Institute to view their character in different lighting environments and use Photo Mode to capture and save their creations.</p><p><em>Code Vein II</em> features a deep narrative where players and characters are bound by blood, fate, and destiny, set in a future where the last remnants of humanity and Revenants struggle against a world on the verge of collapse. The player’s journey will span across haunting, post-apocalyptic landscapes including the flooded ruins of the Sunken City, The Undead Forest, the Corroded Scar, the isolated MagMell Island, and more. As the story unfolds, players will encounter legendary heroes, Revenants whose destinies intertwine with the world’s survival. The game also features distinctive gameplay for an action RPG, where players use blood drained from enemies to unlock a variety of powerful skills, build strategy for combat with Blood codes, and use unique weapons and equipment called Jails to overcome challenging foes and epic bosses.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
