This culminates on the third day, where if players were successful in surviving the night must take on one of the Nightlords—new bosses for this version. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the <em><a title="Games > Elden Ring [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a></em> universe.

A new demo will be available beginning June 6, featuring improvements based on feedback from the game’s May playtest. <span id="more-967384"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Can Can Can a Man:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Gold Gold Adventure Gold</em>, you’re not the hero—you’re the one footing the bill. Build a city in a land besieged by monsters. <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,285 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs show up chasing treasure and glory, and it’s up to you to assign quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. Cross your fingers and hope they make it back alive! While they stumble through danger, you’ll be collecting taxes, upgrading your settlement, and trying not to bankrupt yourself by bribing them to keep going. There’s no problem gold can’t solve—except when you run out of it.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free. Their loyalty lies with GOLD! You’ll have to recruit them with promises of gold or glory, and give them quests! Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique Adventurers</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world. Humans, beastmen, mothmen, undead, and more may join your cause. Pick them all, or only your favorites!</li><li><strong>Build a City</strong> – Build a thriving city around a monster-filled dungeon. Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li><li><strong>Survive the Night (<a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Mode)</strong> – Face waves of chaos in this high-stakes mode where every night brings tougher enemies and harder choices. Build your settlement, spend your coin, and see if your adventurers can survive long enough to see daylight. How many nights can your gold keep them alive?</li><li><strong>Feed the Greed (Colony Sim Mode)</strong> – Take a more relaxed approach in this long-form mode focused on exploration, city growth, and watching your settlement evolve over time. Fewer disasters, more decisions—perfect for players who want to build a beautiful gold-fueled mess at their own pace.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
