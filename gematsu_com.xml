Whether you’re gathering rare flora, collecting new creatures or discovering secrets, there’s always a journey to enjoy too!</li><li><strong>Build a Living, Breathing Village</strong> – Your village isn’t just the buildings you construct, it’s a thriving community that reacts to your choices. Befriend NPCs, manage their moods, and even possibly find romance. The village you build and maintain affects how everyone feels and behaves from a variety of factors. Add decorations, care for your animals, remove pests, and so much more to make this a happy place to be.</li><li><strong>Dive Into an Animal Paradise</strong> – Interact with a massive variety of wild and domestic animals that each bring something different to the ecosystem.

Grow crops, care for animals, and build relationships with your fellow villagers. Each has their own routines, personality, and needs. The more they like you, the more they’ll help around the place – harvesting crops, chopping wood, and even feeding your animals.</li><li><strong>Terraform the Land</strong> – Shape the world to match your vision! Raise hills, carve out rivers, or dig deep underground to uncover hidden secrets, lost treasures, and rare resources.</li><li><strong>A Sandbox of <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>s</strong> – Beyond farming and building, <em>Everdream Village</em> is packed with activities!
