A <a href="https://kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> will launch this summer. Targeted platforms include <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,086 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,026 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,221 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, Mac, and Linux—although the final platform lineup “will depend on each storefront’s paperwork (and how many stretch goals are achieved).” <span id="more-973686"></span></p><p>“Players begged us to fix the crashes, add modern graphics, and maybe stop the dog from pissing on them every five minutes,” said Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi in a press release. “We’re doing two of those things.”</p><p>Flat2VR Studios chief operating officer Eric <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>her added, “Flat2VR Studios is genuinely thrilled to help write the next chapter of the POSTAL saga. Bringing Paradise to new platforms—and putting the shovel in the hands of both longtime fans and first-time troublemakers—is a genuine career highlight for our team.”</p><p>Team Beef co-founder Grant Bagwell said, “The original code tried to die on us daily. Running With Scissors let us butcher it and stitch it back to life—now with fewer surprise blue screens. Kickstarter is simply how we shove even more nonsense in before some suit makes us stop.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Flat2VR Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> is a ground‑up overhaul of 2003’s infamous open‑world <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>. Part modernization, part love‑letter, <em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> will hoist every original asset out of the creaking Unreal 1.5 engine and slam it into today’s Unity—delivering the same familiar week in the POSTAL Dude’s life with a merciless glow‑up and a bucket of new toys.</p><p><em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> was born the moment developer Team Beef’s mad doctors cracked the original <em>POSTAL 2</em> open for <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> (<em><a title="Games > POSTAL 2: VR [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/postal-2-vr">POSTAL 2: VR</a></em>) and saw two decades of code begging for a modern makeover. Rather than compromise the Dude’s glorious return with a quick and dirty spit-shine, publisher Flat2VR Studios convinced Running With Scissors to authorize a full resurrection: preserve every scat‑splattered inch of Paradise, but rebuild the guts so the game actually boots on hardware manufactured this decade—without the aroma of burnt silicon.</p><p>The goal is simple: deliver the ultimate, no‑excuses <em>POSTAL 2</em> sandbox—rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel. <em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> will pack in enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‑up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High-Resolution Textures and Dynamic Lighting</strong> – Paradise’s warped billboards and puddles of questionable fluid finally get the razor‑sharp grime they deserve.</li><li><strong>Zero‑Load Streaming World</strong> – Sprint from one end of town to the other without a single elevator, door pause, or immersion‑breaker.</li><li><strong>Smarter, Freer Crowds</strong> – Civilians still snitch, cops still overreact, but improved path‑finding means riots spark faster and messier than ever.</li><li><strong>Re‑Forged Arsenal</strong> – Weighty ballistics, rag‑doll dismemberment, and rounds that punch clean through unlucky bystanders.</li><li><strong>Fully Propped, Breakable Interiors</strong> – Stores, <a title="Platforms > Arcade [378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a>, and alleyways are stuffed with physics‑enabled junk begging to be destroyed.</li><li><strong>Champ 2.0</strong> – Pet him, sic him, or let him photobomb your next headshot; Paradise’s goodest boy finally earns his kibble.</li></ul><p>Paradise itself will breathe: lighting shifts over the course of each in-game day—from sun-scorched afternoons to lamp-lit alleys come evening—and every junk-strewn corner bristles with physics-enabled debris begging to be destroyed. Every classic instrument of overkill is being rebuilt from the trigger up—plus a few fresh calibers Paradise PD hasn’t outlawed yet. Word on the street is the Dude’s… attachments might be in line for an upgrade too—because tasteful restraint is for other franchises.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="POSTAL 2 Redux - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxoIseTSPOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></em> will feature an online battle mode called “Fox Hunt,” <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> announced. <span id="more-973852"></span></p><p>“Fox Hunt is a completely original online battle mode,” mode director Yu Sahara said in today’s Konami Press Start broadcast. “Although it shares the same worldview of <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [144 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l Gear Solid Delta</em>, the gameplay is completely different. Perhaps many people will think of Metal Gear Online when hearing about a <em>Metal Gear Online</em> battle mode, but Fox Hunt is different from <em>Metal Gear Online</em>.</p><p>“Thankfully, there were requests to bring back <em>Metal Gear Online</em> from players who played <em>Metal Gear Online</em> back in the day. On the other hand, the environment surrounding players has changed drastically since those days. We carefully considered what kind of online battle mode we should create now under today’s circumstances.</p><p>“Based on the ‘<a title="Genres > Stealth [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>‘ of the <em>Metal Gear</em> series—especially ‘camouflage,’ which is a feature of the main story of this game, and the element of ‘<a title="Genres > Survival [428 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>,’ which is the theme of this game—not only focusing on simply shooting at each other, but taking advantage of ‘hide and seek’ and ‘discovering’—building a concept of ‘online battles unique to <em>Metal Gear</em>‘ was a new challenge.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we are not yet able to explain the specifics of the game this time, but we are working on Fox Hunt diligently. We hope to have more specific information about the game as it develops.”</p><p>Konami also confirmed that while the <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> versions of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> will feature the “Snake vs. Monkey” minigame with characters from <em>Ape Escape</em>, the <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> version will feature the “Snake vs. Bomberman” minigame.</p><!-- AD: content -->
