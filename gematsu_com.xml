You arrive as a new settler on the frontier and are left to fend for yourself as you learn the ways of the West. Tend to your needs, manage resources and explore the wilderness; you just might unravel some of the land’s mysteries along the way.</p><p>Over time, you can build your own settlement, defend yourself from outlaws and bandits, form alliances, forge a reputation for good and bad and shape the path that will make you a legend. Do you have what it takes?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
