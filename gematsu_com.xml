With 40 magical runes to combine however you want, every challenge is an opportunity to create your own solution.</p><p><strong>What if Every Puzzle Had Multiple Solutions, and Half of Them Were Things You Invented?</strong></p><p>You start with four runes and collect more as you explore the world of Rhell, using up to five of these in whatever combination you please to solve different puzzles. Want to hold down two buttons, but you’ve only got yourself? Duplicate yourself and turn your copy into a puddle that permanently holds the switch down. Need a vehicle in a quick fix? Cast Life on a rock and use it as your pet car! Whatever the combination, whatever the solution, the magic is yours to master.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>The World’s Gone Quiet</strong></p><p>Everyone has vanished except 12 people, leaving behind empty towns and unanswered questions. As Rhell, a sharp-tongued mage, you explore forgotten ruins filled with ancient secrets, decode mysterious fragments left behind by those who came before, and slowly piece together what really caused this catastrophe. The few remaining inhabitants have their theories, but you might find a truth far stranger than anyone suspected. What started as a simple mystery becomes something that challenges everything you thought you knew.</p><p><strong>Discover Your Own Path</strong></p><p>Wander through nine distinct areas at your own pace – from flooded libraries and underwater cities to volcanic factories and crystal caves. Each location tells its own story through environmental details and hidden lore, along with characters that have their own mysteries to unravel. Some areas connect in unexpected ways, rewarding those who explore thoroughly. The world doesn’t just contain puzzles, it is a puzzle—one that reveals more of itself the deeper you dig. Whether you’re following the main plot or getting side-tracked by a curious detail, there’s always another secret waiting just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Shape Your Story</strong></p><p>If you choose to help the people you meet along your journey, you might see Rhell’s character develop. Help the lonely characters and watch her soften into someone who genuinely cares. Ignore them entirely and she’ll stay the blunt, loud-mouthed mage she started as. With multiple endings to discover, let your curiosity and kindness (or lack thereof) lead you.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>40 magical runes creating millions of spell combinations (102,400,000 to be exact!).</li><li>Creative ways to solve each puzzle—do it your own way!</li><li>Semi-open world with nine distinct areas to explore.</li><li>Hours of gameplay with endless experimentation and replayability.</li><li>Rich, story driven narrative with branching paths and multiple endings.</li><li>Sarcastic, sassy mage who accidentally helps people while being rude about it.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLLvF0e5e0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/rhell-warped-worlds-troubled-times-for-pc-launches-march-19-2026]]></content:encoded>
