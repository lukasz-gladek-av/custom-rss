She is so abnormal that even the fantasy land of Gensokyo considers her an anomaly. Truth is, she can visit Gensokyo in her dreams!</p><p><strong>A New Incident Has Occurred, and Gensokyo Has a Clone Problem</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia</em> is a first-person dungeon crawler where the player, as Sumireko, has to navigate tricky mazes and capture a party of the strongest <em>Touhou</em> characters to assist them in turn-based battles. Go all over Gensokyo and beyond, to solve an incident which seems a little too convenient for Sumireko, seeing as she’s the only person in Gensokyo who has a tool to control this infestation of clones: her newly-bought smartphone.</p><p><strong>A Large Selection of Your Favorite <em>Touhou</em> Characters</strong></p><p>Clones are roaming the lands! They are known as Sleepers and take the shape of established <em>Touhou</em> characters, and as such, almost every <em>Touhou</em> character is represented and playable. Sumireko’s phone is equipped with a special app that allows her to capture Sleepers by beating them in a round of Danmaku.</p><p>If you win, you can add them to your party, or turn them into useful items! You can also fuse multiple Sleepers together to make something new entirely.</p><p>Adding Sleepers to your party will increase battery usage. If your phone runs out of battery charge, you will lose access to Sleepers and your Map, so always come prepared!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaQHw0i_Id4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/touhou-artificial-dream-in-arcadia-coming-to-ps5-ps4-and-switch-on-july-3]]></content:encoded>
