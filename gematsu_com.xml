      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Evil Empire [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/evil-empire">Evil Empire</a> has released its first update for <em><a title="Games > Brotato [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/brotato">Brotato</a></em> since <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/brotato-post-launch-development-moved-to-evil-empire">taking over</a> the game’s post-launch development. Titled “New Dawn,” the update is available now for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, with consoles and mobile versions to follow in approximately one month. <span id="more-1002814"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Evil Empire:</p><blockquote><p>The “New Dawn” update is the first new content update for <em>Brotato</em> since late 2024 and focuses on extensive quality of life changes—including an all-new ban system. Though, in true Evil Empire fashion, players will also find new items and a new weapon in there, too.</p><ul><li><strong>New Items</strong> – Leading the update are six new items which include Fresh Meat, Fruit Basket, Candy Bag, Ghost Outfit, Will-o’-Wisp and Hourglass—all of which provide various benefits to players skillsets and strengths while they take on wave after wave of gross little aliens.</li><li><strong>New Weapon</strong> – Also joining the fray is a new weapon fans can wield if they so choose, the Vorpal Sword, which alternates between thrusting and sweeping attacks and grants players the ability to one-shot an enemy for the first time.</li><li><strong>Ban System</strong> – Additional extras in today’s update includes the Ban system, a much-requested community feature that will allow players to ban up to eight items during a run. Win a run in Danger 3 or more to unlock the Ban system. Note: the Ban system does not include weapons.</li><li><strong>New Saves</strong> – The New Dawn update also introduces three new save slots which gives players the option to copy progress onto another profile (or reset the save). Unlocking every item, character, weapon and Danger level on a save will deactivate the earning of achievements, so use with caution as you will still have to earn them the hard way.</li><li><strong>Codex</strong> – The Codex introduces a new wiki-esque feature to the game, with information about Items, Weapons and Enemies (for example: How many times you killed a specific alien, etc.). Evil Empire plans to continue to build this feature out based on player feedback.</li></ul></blockquote><p>A longer and fully detailed list of updates can be found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1942280/eventcomments/600792156684433940/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did. From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, <em>Bloodhunt</em> has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.</p><p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to <em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p><p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take <em>Bloodhunt</em> offline.</p><p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the <em>Bloodhunt</em> servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p><p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p><p>The game will remain fully playable until April 28, 2026. After this date, the servers will be taken offline, and the game will no longer be available on either PC or PlayStation 5.</p><p>As of today, token purchases have been disabled. However, the in-game store will still be open, allowing you to spend any tokens you may have until the servers go down. Once the game goes offline, any remaining tokens will not be usable.</p><p>All account and gameplay data will be deleted after closure in accordance with GDPR and/or equivalent.</p><p>This announcement does not affect your statutory rights. <em>Bloodhunt</em> and all related services are provided under the Privacy Policy and EULA available here.</p><p>If you have questions about your account, data or other inquiries please reach out to <a href="https://support.sharkmob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob Support</a>.</p><p>We encourage everyone to enjoy the time that remains in Prague and to keep playing, making the most of these final months together.</p><p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p><p>—The Sharkmob Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-to-end-service-on-april-28-2026]]></content:encoded>
