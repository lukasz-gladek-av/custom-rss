    <p><span>Introducing "Hell" mode.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released a new trailer for the remastered version of <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> title <em><a title="Games > Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny (2025) [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-2025">Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</a></em>, featuring director Motohide Eshiro who introduces the new “Hell” mode. <span id="more-951509"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>The trailer showcased the Director’s Cut featuring Motohide Eshiro and the all-new “Hell” mode. In this mode players will experience a challenging new difficulty for only the bravest of samurai where a single hit means instant death. <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> returns with an enhanced remaster set to captivate a new generation.</p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>, the highly acclaimed, best-selling hack and slash game from Capcom’s classic samurai <a title="Genres > Action [2,588 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> series, originally released in 2002 and combines rich narrative and intense demon-slaying combat that made it a standout in the <em>Onimusha</em> franchise. Blending historical figures and supernatural folklore in feudal Japan, the story follows a new hero, master swordsman Jubei Yagyu, who sets out on a quest to defeat Nobunaga Oda and his army of demons. As players engage in intense swordplay, they must also make choices that impact the narrative in unexpected ways.</p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> also features a range of new game mechanics, including an affinity system with Jubei’s allies and branching narrative paths along with new quality-of-life features such as the ability to swap weapons without pausing the action and the power to choose when Jubei transforms into an Onimusha. Modern improvements like auto-saves, skippable cutscenes, multiple aspect ratios, and more are included, along with an in-game gallery expansion with 100 newly added pieces of artwork and the original soundtrack.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom revealed a special bonus for players who pre-order <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> or pick up the “<em>Onimusha 1</em>+<em>2</em> Pack” bundle early, which will include the “<em>Onimusha 2</em>: Orchestra Album Selection Pack,” featuring orchestral music tracks and helpful in-game items. Players with save data from the 2019 remaster of <em>Onimusha: Warlords</em> can also unlock a special outfit for Jubei inspired by Samanosuke, the protagonist from the original game.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
