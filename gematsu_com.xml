      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > CD Projekt RED [203 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a> has <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1778/cd-projekt-red-and-epic-games-present-the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo-at-the-state-of-unreal-2025" target="_blank">released</a> a new cinematic trailer and technical demonstration of <em><a title="Games > The Witcher IV [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher IV</a></em> as part of State of Unreal 2025. The technical demonstration is running on a base <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,578 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> at 60 frames per second with ray-tracing. <span id="more-969180"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>As Unreal Fest 2025 kicked off, CD Projekt RED joined <a title="Companies > Epic Games [349 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> on stage to present a tech demo of <em>The Witcher IV</em> in Unreal Engine 5. Presented in typical CD Projekt RED style, the tech demo follows the main protagonist Ciri in the midst of a monster contract and shows off some of the innovative Unreal Engine 5 technology and features that will power the game’s open world.</p><p>The tech demo takes place in the region of Kovir—which will make its very first appearance in the video game series in <em>The Witcher IV</em>. The presentation followed main protagonist Ciri—along with her horse Kelpie—as she made her way through the rugged mountains and dense forests of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. Along the way, CD PROJEKT RED and Epic Games dove deep into how each feature is helping drive performance, visual fidelity, and shape <em>The Witcher IV</em>‘s immersive open world.</p><p> Watch the full presentation from Unreal Fest 2025 now at LINK.</p><p>Since the strategic partnership was announced in 2022, CDPR has been working with Epic Games to develop new tools and enhance existing features in Unreal Engine 5 to expand the engine’s open-world development capabilities and establish robust tools geared toward CD PROJEKT RED’s open-world design philosophies. The demo, which runs on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second, shows off in-engine capabilities set in the world of <em>The Witcher IV</em>, including the new Unreal Animation Framework, Nanite Foliage rendering, MetaHuman technology with Mass AI crowd scaling, and more. The tools showcased are being developed, tested, and eventually released to all UE developers, starting with today’s Unreal Engine 5.6 release. This will help other studios create believable and immersive open-world environments that deliver performance at 60 FPS without compromising on quality—even at vast scales. While the presentation was running on a PlayStation console, the features and technology will be supported across all platforms the game will launch on.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Unreal Animation Framework powers realistic character movements in busy scenes. FastGeo Streaming, developed in collaboration with Epic Games, allows environments to load quickly and smoothly. Nanite Foliage fills forests and fields with dense detail without sacrificing performance. The Mass system handles large, dynamic crowds with ease, while ML Deformer adds subtle, realistic touches to character animation—right down to muscle movement.</p></blockquote><p>“We started our partnership with Epic Games to push <a title="Genres > Open-World [644 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> technology forward,” said CD Projekt RED joint CEO Michal Nowakowski in a press release. “To show this early look at the work we’ve been doing using Unreal Engine running at 60 [frames per second] on PlayStation 5, is a significant milestone—and a testament of the great cooperation between our teams. But we’re far from finished. I look forward to seeing more advancements and inspiring technology from this partnership as development of <em>The Witcher IV</em> on Unreal Engine 5 continues.”</p><p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney added, “CD Projekt RED is one of the industry’s best open-world game studios, and we’re grateful that they’re working with us to push Unreal Engine forward with <em>The Witcher IV</em>. They are the perfect partner to help us develop new world-building features that we can share with all Unreal Engine developers.”</p><p><em>The Witcher IV</em> will be available for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,276 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.
