This is SUNNY SIDE UP.</p><p>We’d like to extend our sincere gratitude to all of you for your patience in awaiting the official release of <em>Little Witch in the Woods</em>. Development of the full version has taken longer than anticipated. We fully understand the anxiety and fatigue you are experiencing.</p><p>The past few years have seen us investing immense time and effort into making this game. It’s your faith in us, your support during Early Access, and your assistance in every aspect that have kept us going till the day.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Recently, we finally announced with excitement the release date of the full version. However, shortly after our announcement, we learned that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>—a highly anticipated new title of a masterpiece in the gaming industry—is launching on the same day. <em>Silksong</em> is a game we look up to with awe as developers, and eagerly anticipate as players. Given its immense influence, we fear that launching <em>Little Witch in the Woods</em> on the same day would not only dishearten our dedicated team, but also disappoint our devoted audience.</p><p>Having taken everything into account, we now decide to adjust the release of the full version to September 15, 2025.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for the delay. To honor your patience and support, we promise to keep working on the game and deliver Little Witch in the Woods in a highly polished form.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/little-witch-in-the-woods-for-pc-delayed-to-september-15]]></content:encoded>
