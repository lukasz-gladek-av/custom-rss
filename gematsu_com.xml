        <p>Cloud Streaming unlocks new ways to play: enjoy a game side-by-side with a friend who’s using your PlayStation 5 under a separate account, or stream your favorite game while someone else watches a movie on the console. Cloud Streaming also makes it easier to enjoy PlayStation 5 games on the go—at a hotel, cafe, friend’s place, or anywhere else with a high-speed internet Wi-Fi connection—since you can keep playing even when your PlayStation 5 console back home is powered off or is in use by another account.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PS-Portal-Update_11-05-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Redesigned User Interface</strong></p><p>A refreshed home screen now features three tabs: Remote Play, Cloud Streaming, and Search.</p><ul><li><strong>Remote Play Home Screen</strong> – Connect to a PlayStation 5 console paired with the PlayStation Portal to enjoy games installed on that console.
