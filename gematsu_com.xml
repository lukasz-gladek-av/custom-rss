Between maniac <a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [58 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> bosses, revenge-driven Idols, and enticing cult leaders, Kobayashi’s trip through Tokyo’s underworld is not only a relentless fight for <a title="Genres > Survival [440 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, but also a journey of self-discovery, filled with dark humor and unexpected twists. Paired with an unforgettable soundtrack created by legendary musician Andrew Hulshult and a story told through almost 100 pages of unique comic book panels drawn by comic artist Hans Steinbach, we believe that <em>Tokyo Underground Killer</em> will deliver a gaming experience unlike anything else.”</p><p>Here are the latest details, via Phoenix Game Productions:</p><blockquote><p>Players step into the role of Kobayashi, the feared “Shinjuku Vampire”—a notorious assassin for Japan’s most powerful <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e syndicate, Gokuraku. Cut your way through Tokyo’s back alleys in lightning-fast sword fights, harness 10 supernatural Blood Skills to summon fire tornadoes or drain enemies’ life force, and master unlockable abilities to defeat 10 uniquely challenging bosses.</p><p>To celebrate this announcement, the team has released a brand-new gameplay video, offering the most in-depth look yet at the game’s adrenaline-fueled katana combat and the gritty life of protagonist Kobayashi in Tokyo’s crime-infested underworld — a place where dazzling neon lights meet unflinching, brutal violence.</p><p>From rain-slick side streets in Shinjuku to the electric chaos of Akihabara, Tokyo Underground Killer blends over-the-top katana carnage with a neon-soaked Tokyo backdrop inspired by real-world locations</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The game is fully voiced in English and Japanese, featuring an all-star Japanese cast including the legendary Hidekatsu Shibata (<em>Naruto</em>, <em>One Piece</em>, <em><a title="Series > Dragon Ball [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/dragon-ball">Dragon Ball</a></em>) as Ishihara—Kobayashi’s ruthless crime boss.</p><p>Sharpen your blade, embrace the chaos, and carve your bloody path to freedom beneath Tokyo’s neon-soaked night.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tokyo Underground Killer - Release Date &amp; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Nkz4vwsdwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/tokyo-underground-killer-for-pc-launches-september-5]]></content:encoded>
