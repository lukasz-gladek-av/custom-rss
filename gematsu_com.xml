        <p>Command a capable crop of different types of Pikmin to strategically overcome obstacles, defeat creatures, and find food for your famished home planet! You can even bring a second player along to divvy up tasks as you explore a world that seems larger than life from a pint-sized perspective.</p><p><strong><em>Pikmin</em> at Your Pace</strong></p><p>Return to your ship before time runs out, or you (and your Pikmin) could be in big trouble. If you prefer a more casual approach, a variety of difficulty settings, lock-on targeting and optional hints have been newly added. With less pressure, you have more time to strategically command your Pikmin and take in the lush scenery.</p><p><strong>Play Side-Story Missions, Head-to-Head Matches, and More!</strong></p><p>This deluxe version of the <em>Pikmin 3</em> game includes new side-story missions featuring Olimar and Louie, the ability to play Story mode with a friend and all downloadable content stages from the original release. Feeling competitive? Enjoy fierce head-to-head Bingo Battles against another player!</p><p>Three brave explorers land on planet PNF-404 on a mission to find food for their starving home planet. After a crash landing, these explorers must work with Pikmin to reunite and complete their mission.</p><p>Direct, toss and grow Pikmin with different abilities and strengths—winged Pikmin can fly, while blue Pikmin can breathe underwater. By strategically choosing the right Pikmin for the job at hand and changing between the three captains (or coordinating with a second player), you can work efficiently to collect fruit and grow your Pikmin squad.</p><p>When you aren’t busy collecting fruit and saving your planet, try out Mission mode to accomplish set requirements like defeating enemies or collecting items. You can also compare your Mission mode scores with the rest of the world via online leaderboards*. Looking for some friendly competition? In Bingo Battle you must use Pikmin to retrieve items on your bingo card before your opponent does.</p><p>With more options for <a title="Genres > Co-Op [364 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, settings that make it easy for newcomers to start their <em>Pikmin</em> journey, new side stories and more, these tiny Pikmin are in for their biggest adventure yet.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pikmin-3-deluxe-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe]]></content:encoded>
