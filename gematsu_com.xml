But he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,687 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> team would respect his wishes.”</p><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Demon’s Souls</em> was also developed by FromSoftware. Miyazaki, speaking to Edge magazine in 2022 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-says-elden-rings-graphics-team-felt-extra-pressure-due-to-demons-souls-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>), said that while he had not played the remake by Bluepoint Games, he was happy to see it renewed for a new generation—supporting Yoshida’s theory that <em>Bloodborne</em> may be a special case.</p><p>“As you say, I was not directly involved in it, and I haven’t actually played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake,” Miyazaki said at the time. “But this is because I just don’t enjoy playing the games that I’ve made in the past. It brings up a lot of old emotions, a lot of old memories, and this gets a little bit overwhelming, and it doesn’t feel like playing any more. So I have not played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake, but I am very glad to see it get this fresh look, these brand-new current-gen graphics.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“It was an old game, so to see it get remade in this way and have new players playing it was obviously something that made me very happy.</p><p>“It was a rough game back in the day, with a relatively rough development, so I was anxious that new players would not enjoy it in that same way. That was a cause of concern for me when it was re-released but, you know, in the end, I’m just happy to see the reaction and happy to see people enjoying it.</p><p>“One thing that was really fun was seeing [Bluepoint Games] come up with things we didn’t consider and to approach certain elements of the game its visuals and its mechanics in a way that we either couldn’t or didn’t back in the day. So to see them researching and applying these new thought processes and new techniques, this was something that was really exciting and interesting for me.”</p><p>Unrelated to Bluepoint Games, Brandon Sheffield, director at <em><a title="Games > Demonschool [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demonschool">Demonschool</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Necrosoft Games [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/necrosoft-games">Necrosoft Games</a>, said his studio also pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em>-related project to Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>“I could find you 10 companies that have pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel, spinoff, or remake, including my own,” Sheffield said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3mfumxivzgc2t" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. “It’s just not going to happen unless [FromSoftware] decides they want to do it.”</p><p><strong>Bluepoint Games’ Closure</strong></p><p>The <em>Bloodborne</em> pitch is a small part in a larger report surrounding Bluepoint Games’ closure. According to Bloomberg, following its acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bluepoint Games continued its work assisting <a title="Companies > Santa Monica Studio [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/santa-monica-studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> on <em><a title="Games > God of War Ragnarok [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a></em>.</p><p>After 2022, the studio began work on a live-service game set in the <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> universe, in which the character Atreus falls into Hades. A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to include some form of <a title="Genres > Co-Op [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play and ongoing support, but much of the game’s design was still in flux.</p><p>Bluepoint Games struggled to develop a live-service game, being a small team mostly skilled in art and engineering rather than design. Some Bluepoint Games staff wanted to work on a traditional <a title="Genres > Action [3,445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> rather than a live-service project.</p><p>After several years of struggling development, even with help from Santa Monica Studio, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sony-interactive-entertainment-cancels-live-service-games-from-bluepoint-games-and-bend-studio">canceled</a> the <em>God of War</em> live-service project in January 2025.</p><p>It was around then that, in searching for its next project, Bluepoint Games pitched a remake of <em>Bloodborne</em>. After that was turned down, it spent some time pitching an updated version of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> game it had previously remade in 2018, but that was also turned down. It also pitched other studios under the Sony Interactive Entertainment umbrella about developing new projects in other franchises, such as a spin-off of <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>, but nothing was greenlit.</p><p>By February 2026, Bluepoint Games had gone more than a year without securing a new project. After Sony announced plans on February 12 to remake the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy without Bluepoint Games’ involvement, some employees at the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was shutting down.</p><p>According to people familiar with Sony Interactive Entertainment’s thinking, the company no longer believed Bluepoint Games was equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a partnership that made sense.</p><p>Recently, as Bluepoint Games’ former staff look for jobs—including opportunities to apply for positions at other studios within Sony Interactive Entertainment— other companies were making phone calls to see if there might be a way to salvage the studio, according to people familiar with the situation, as unlikely as the prospect may be.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/bloomberg-bluepoint-games-pitched-a-bloodborne-remake-but-was-turned-down]]></content:encoded>
