A demo is available now. <span id="more-992360"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Heavy Lunch Studio:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Hermit and Pig</em> is a fresh spin on the retro pixel art adventure RPG. Fans of Earthbound will resonate with the humorous and evocative tones, but find refreshing twists on the core game mechanics. The key-combo combat system draws inspiration from games like Street Fighter and Paper Mario to provide for a more engaging gameplay experience that prioritizes player skill growth over grinding for experience points, while players get to take on Hermit’s own social anxiety through humorous NPC conversation battles that induce real cringe damage.</p><p><em>Hermit and Pig</em>‘s woodland solitude is disrupted when a girl from a nearby town approaches them asking for help. The local factory has mysteriously fired all of its workers and brought in new, shady personnel to man the machines. Hermit and Pig head out in hopes of finding an enormous, mythical mushroom to help the town stave off hunger, but they might not be the only ones looking for it…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone</strong> – Keep your wits about you as you travel far outside your comfort zone through a mystery of local disturbances to hunt for a giant, mythical mushroom. The path is filled with corporate stooges, weird cultists, rival truffle hunters, and uncharacteristically violent animals.</li><li><strong>Engage in Tense, Time-Sensitive Combat</strong> – Race the clock while you input unique key combos for attacks that grow in complexity as you progress through the world.</li><li><strong>Chat with the Locals</strong>&nbsp;– Seek clues through anxiety-laden conversations with an eccentric cast of NPCs. Avoid taking cringe damage and level up your social game while you navigate Hermit’s social anxiety.</li><li><strong>Mushroom Foraging</strong>&nbsp;– Forage dozens of unique, real-life (and a few not-so-real-life) mushroom types to heal, cure ailments, do damage, and cause status effects; use truffles for currency; and track your collection in a mushroom field guide.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Hermit and Pig - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJ0BurSk5e0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/hermit-and-pig-launches-january-22-2026]]></content:encoded>
