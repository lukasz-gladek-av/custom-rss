Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original <em>Backyard</em> titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t use the original 32-bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Coming Soon Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Football '99 - Coming Soon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QdSB2Mtsl8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/backyard-football-99-launches-september-9-for-pc-ios-and-android]]></content:encoded>
