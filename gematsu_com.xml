        <p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> began life as a remaster of the original title before D-Pad Studio got carried away by their enthusiasm and ended up creating a full blown sequel to the original title. <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> takes the shoot ’em up <a title="Genres > Platformer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> to new heights, with a host of new content that more than doubles the size of the original game. Venture through five stages, each with their own unique gimmick, across which you’ll have to battle Laser Sharks, robotic space invaders and even an immortal Samurai. To beat these new stages and take down the bosses at the end of each, you’ll have a new double jump, cancel-jump and mid-air powershots to add to your arsenal. There’s also a new endless Survival Mode, new difficulties modes—including a <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,068 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System-style, no checkpoints Hardcore Mode— and 36 newly composed songs from acclaimed Norwegian musician Savant.</p><p>In <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em>, you play as the Alchemist, who’s been cast down from his tower by an unknown force. Your goal is to ascend back to the top, with your movement limited at all times to two platforms, be they moving elevators or space debris. By using rapid volleys of magic missiles to take out attacking enemies and precise dashes and jumps to move between the two platforms, you must try to survive the deadly journey back to the summit.</p><p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> is the ultimate way to experience a musical artist’s persona as you’ve never done before! The game is based on the universe of <em>Savant</em>—developed in collaboration with Simon S. Andersen of D-Pad Studio (<em>Owlboy</em> / <em><a title="Games > Vikings on Trampolines [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/vikings-on-trampolines">Vikings on Trampolines</a></em>). Hear Savant’s unrivaled genre bending in action as you obtain new pieces of the soundtrack and remixes. The game even gives you the option to customize your own playlist as you play.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Savant - Ascent REMIX - Nintendo Switch Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnVUjAmYLo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gruesomely designed enemies lurk, danger lies around every corner, and you best hide, or run.&nbsp;<em>Ritual Tides</em> presents a “gun,” but not in a typical fashion, candidly setting it apart from other games within this space. More on this to come in the future, no spoilers for now!</p><p><em>Ritual Tides</em> is set to make waves within the horror genre, and is being developed by a proven team made up of senior talents from the likes of ex-Rockstar Games, CI Games, TT Games, and more. Talent knows no bounds within Vertpaint, with glowing appraisals from industry legend and Director Jonathan Berube, who referred to the team as, “The seal team of game development.”</p><p><em>Ritual Tides</em> is being developed using what the team describes as a “two stream” approach, meaning design and game mechanics are prioritized alongside art research and development. As avid gamers and horror fans, the team is <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> something genuinely memorable and will be sure to stick in players’ minds long after the credits have rolled. Enemy variation is central to the development ethos and unlike other horror-focused titles, <em>Ritual Tides</em> will provide a wealth of encounters, each more uniquely terrifying than the last.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As if all of this wasn’t riveting enough, Vertpaint is purely independent and uncompromising in its uniquely dark vision for <em>Ritual Tides</em>, with no external publisher input to potentially hinder the process. The team also promises to set the visual quality bar for 2025, giving <em>Ritual Tides</em> players a near-photorealistic immersive story to unfold.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser Trailer</span></h2></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
