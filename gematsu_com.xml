A release date was not announced. <span id="more-969366"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hypersect:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. Only one village remains—an island of safety in a world devoured by the creeping darkness of the Never. You are their last hope: an undying warrior spirit, embodied in living silver, with the strength to face the Never’s endless hordes.</p><p><em>Never’s End</em> is a turn-based tactical <a title="Genres > RPG [17,308 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> about possession, sacrifice, and the power to reshape your world. Turn townsfolk into your mortal vessels, imbue them with elemental magic, and explore a vast and deadly wilderness in your quest to finally end the Never.</p><p><strong>Command the Elements</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The world of <em>Never’s End</em> is deeply simulated and completely interactive. Temperature, weather, wind, water level, and even the density of the earth beneath your feet can all be manipulated to gain the advantage in combat.</p><p>Drain rivers dry or flood the battlefield. Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava. Every battlefield is rife with opportunities—a well-placed spell can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><p><strong>Possess Your <a title="Genres > Party [97 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></strong></p><p>Only you can survive the Never. Rather than recruiting allies, you must possess them—burning away their self and soul to turn them into living weapons. For each companion you gain, another life is lost: doomed to fight at your side until either you succeed, or they fall in battle.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_969374"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Reclaim Your World</strong></p><p>Fight your way through an open world of rain-soaked jungles, blistering deserts, and freezing tundra as you explore the wreckage of a forgotten golden age. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>nse corrupted settlements, awaken long-dormant temples, unearth lost technology, and then reap the rewards as civilization rebuilds in your wake.</p><p><strong>Destroy the Never</strong></p><p>Your path to victory is your own. Will you hunt fearsome beasts to upgrade your temples, or establish new towns to grow your ranks? Will you trade lives in search of greater power, or prove your skill by heading straight for the Never’s heart?</p><p>There are many ways to prepare for the final battle, but every choice has consequences. The longer you take, the more lives you’ll require… and the stronger the Never becomes.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
