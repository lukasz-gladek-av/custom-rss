Recover lost technology, craft vital systems, and ensure humanity’s future—before it’s too late.</p><p>You are the Last Caretaker, a lone machine reawakened after centuries of silence. The Earth is flooded, its towering megastructures rusting under an endless sky. The Seed Vaults remain, containing the last human seeds—waiting to be born. Your mission is clear: recover the seeds, reactivate the Lazarus Complex, and launch the last of humanity to the stars.</p><p>But the world is not as empty as it seems.

    <p><span>Breaking the fourth wall.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > 11 bit studios [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> has released a new trailer for <a title="Genres > Survival [380 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival game</a> <em><a title="Games > The Alters [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a></em>, in which the fourth wall is broken as the game’s alternate version of the main character play <em>The Alters</em>. <span id="more-946390"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>Survival may be a familiar challenge in games, but 11 bit studios’ upcoming ambitious science-fiction title, <em>The Alters</em>, takes it to an intensely personal level. In <em>The Alters</em>, survival isn’t just about enduring the unknown—it’s about confronting yourself in the most personal way possible; face-to-face. After all, what could be more personal than navigating life-or-death decisions alongside alternate versions of who you could have been? Jan Dolski is an ordinary worker—now the sole survivor of a crash landing on a distant, unforgiving planet. Stranded and alone, he faces an impossible task: operating a massive mobile base designed for an entire crew all while escaping the relentless, burning sun. His only chance lies in the Alters—alternate versions of himself, shaped by pivotal choices he never made, each with different skills, different memories, and different lives.</p><p>As revealed in the latest trailer, which subtly plays with the notion of breaking the fourth wall, working with these different Jans is anything but straightforward. They are not just copies. Some took different paths and look upon the first Jan’s choices with pity. Others succeeded where he failed, living lives he never had the chance to—and now, maybe, they don’t even believe he has the guts to be a leader.</p><p>But none of that matters when survival is at stake. Like it or not, they must find a way to work together—one way or another.</p><p><em>The Alters</em> blends a meaningful, emergent narrative—where choices truly matter—with survival gameplay, exploration, resource gathering, and base-building and management mechanics.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
