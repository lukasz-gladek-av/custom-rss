The developer cited <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-launches-september-4"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>‘s September 4 release</a> and a lack of a <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [361 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> development kit “to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms” as reasons for the delay. <span id="more-987501"></span></p><p>Here is the full message from Aeternum Game Studios on the delay:</p><blockquote><p>Dear community,</p><p>As you know, we’ve been working on Aeterna Lucis for more than four years, our most ambitious project to date. A title that means the world to us and represents the greatest effort of the entire Aeternum Game Studios team.</p><p>Our initial plan was to launch it this September, but after the announcement of [<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>], we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</p><p>In addition, we still don’t have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms. To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That’s why we’ve made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</p><p>The game is already finished, and we will use this additional time to keep polishing it, refining every detail, and making sure it delivers the perfect experience our community deserves. We know this change disrupts many of our strategies, but we are confident that with your support we can overcome this major challenge.</p><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank <a title="Companies > Team Cherry [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-cherry">Team Cherry</a>. There’s no need to wish them luck-we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> genre is more alive than ever and, in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><p>Thank you for walking this journey with us. 2026 will be a special year, and we can’t wait to live it alongside all of you.</p><p>With all our love,<br>The Aeternum Game Studios Team</p></blockquote><p><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and now presumably, Switch 2.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/aeterna-lucis-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” will launch on September 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-987401"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>After thwarting the Exaltists’ conspiracy previously, the Defense Force dispatches the Obol Squad to join the conflict, introducing the new agents Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus. With trustworthy allies and various in-game events, Proxies will get to delve deeper into the power struggles in New Eridu and uncover the past of the familiar yet fresh faction, the Obol Squad.</p><p>The Defense Force’s intervention—spearheaded by Major General Lorenz and commanded by Colonel Isolde—throws Waifei Peninsula’s power struggles into even more turbulent waters. Beyond eliminating the Exaltists’ remnants, the Obol Squad will also uncover long-buried truths and reveal the hidden stories behind team member Seed’s mysterious past and inner world.</p><p>As a genius mechanic, the S-Rank Electric Attack Agent Seed has transformed the Seed Sr. mecha into a formidable partner with overwhelming firepower and suppression capabilities. Seed excels in synergizing with other Attack agents to enhance the team’s sustained damage output. Orphie &amp; Magus, the S-Rank Fire Attack Agent and Obol Squad’s captain, excels in coordinated team combat using powerful lasers. Through EX Special Attack that assists allies, Orphie can accumulate Bottled Heat, and place all squad members into the Zeroed In state upon hitting enemies, boosting Attack and allowing Aftershocks to ignore a portion of the enemy’s Defense. Joining the stellar lineup is Mercury, the outstanding S-Rank Bangboo who operates a tank as combat support on the battlefield. S-Rank Electric Stun Agent Trigger and S-Rank Fire Attack Agent Evelyn will return in Version 2.2. Additionally, Soldier 0 – Anby is currently undergoing intensive training, and Proxies can expect her to return even stronger with her activated potential in future versions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_987402"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As for events, the Bangboo tower defense event Band of Brave Bangboo will come with new maps, enemies, and mechanics, including bushes and Miasmic environment. Successfully clearing stages will reward Proxies with the A-Rank Excaliboo. This Bangboo will attempt to draw his holy sword before attacking—success results in powerful sword strikes, while failure leads to determined hammer attacks against opponents. For lighter entertainment, the Rhythm Rave event challenges Proxies to sync beats with classic tracks and earn abundant in-game rewards.</p><p>Continuous optimizations has also been implemented to further improve player experience. For example, Proxies can now choose between Belle or Wise before starting companion events such as Quality Time invites.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.2 special program below.
