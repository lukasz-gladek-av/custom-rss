In <em>Kinki Spiritual Affairs Bureau</em>, you’re just as much of a threat as the spirits themselves!</p><p>The story takes place in Japan, where exorcisms are carried out by government agents. The protagonist is Mizuki Shirakawa, who is an exorcist from the Kinki Spiritual Affairs Bureau. Mizuki visits Saiga Village in Nara to investigate a mystery in which all trances of the village have been wiped off the internet. Upon her arrival, she discovers all villagers have gone missing and the village is infested with a disproportionate number of unlawful spirits.</p><p>Electricity, communications, and the internet in the village have been all cut-off, and Shiraishi also finds out that someone is pulling the strings behind the incident.</p><!-- AD: content -->
