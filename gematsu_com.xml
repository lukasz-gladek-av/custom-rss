A demo is available now for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4369950/CALX_Demo/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1027897"></span></p><p>The demo lets players experience the opening of the game, featuring a full tutorial that introduces all core mechanics, along with a section of the Canyon, the game’s first zone.

Explore planet Syro—vast landscapes filled with crystal structures and ancient technology. Find out what the WARP did to the Quoths civilization. The environment guides you, revealing secrets through exploration.</p><p>The game moves between stillness and frenzy. <a title="Companies > Sile" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sile">Sile</a>nt moments give way to frantic fights in a rhythm like waves—contemplation, then action, then back again. Art and music work in tandem. The mesmerizing visuals shape the soundscape, and the music breathes life back into the art.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are alone on Syro, but not lonely. A speck of dust in a vast, mysterious world. There’s a quiet melancholy to wandering these forgotten places.</p><p><strong>Movement Opens the World</strong></p><p>Movement is your main tool. Double jump, air dash, levitate, and use a grappling hook to reach new areas. The world is interconnected. It opens as you gain new abilities. Rediscover hidden paths through revisiting old areas.</p><p>The world tells its story as you explore. Secrets are concealed in ruins. Puzzles emerge as you investigate. The environment reveals the past events.</p><p><strong>Contemplative, With Meaningful Combat</strong></p><p>Your companion AFX travels with you and grows stronger as you progress. Combat mixes melee attacks and ranged shots. Perfect your ‘dodge’ timing to gain tactical advantages in fights.</p><p>You’ll collect upgrades throughout your journey. These enhance your combat and movement skills. Find new weapons in the ruins. Each one changes how you approach fights.</p><p>Fights test how well you move, not just how fast you attack. Combat areas work like movement puzzles. Your mobility matters as much as your weapons.</p><p><strong>Different Zones, Different Moods</strong></p><p>Each area has its own feel. Some are quiet and still, while others pulse with strange energy. The game values calm moments as much as action.</p><p>You upgrade by finding pieces of old technology. These upgrades change how you move through the world. Choose freely which areas to explore next</p><p><em>CALX</em> is about 10 to 15 hours long. <a title="Companies > Reminisce [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/reminisce">Reminisce</a>nt of classic action <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,894 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Atmospheric Exploration on Planet Syro</strong> – Vast landscapes filled with crystal structures and ancient tech shaped by visionary science-fiction art.</li><li><strong>Movement as Your Main Tool</strong> – Double jump, aerial dash, levitate, and grappling hook mechanics that open new paths as you progress.</li><li><strong>Contemplative Pacing</strong> – A game that values stillness and observation as much as action.</li><li><strong>Interconnected World Design</strong> – Gain new abilities to unlock hidden areas and discover secrets in places you’ve already visited.</li><li><strong>Combat Meets Mobility</strong> – Blend melee strikes with AFX’s ranged shots.
