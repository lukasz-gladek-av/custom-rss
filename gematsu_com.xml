    <p><span>Return to the "Planet of Festivities" and discover the unseen side of the Penacony journey with The Dahlia.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Memories are the Prelude to Dreams,” is coming soon, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [216 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1011805"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As the epic journey of Amphoreus comes to an end, the Astral Express will focus on Penacony before embarking on its next space fantasy destination. This time the “Planet of Festivities” emanates a completely different aura from before, and players will have the opportunity to explore the untold mysteries alongside the new limited five-star character Constance “The Dahlia.” Meanwhile, challenging enemies and distinctive limited-time events will be introduced, weaving together an adventurous journey through the galaxy filled with danger, opportunities, and rewards.</p><p>Penacony, Land of Dreams, is a vacation spot where interstellar visitors gather to celebrate and have fun. In the previous chapter during the Charmony Festival, the members of the Astral Express successfully awakened those who had fallen into beautiful dreams, empowering them to take control of their own reality. However, beneath the seemingly perfect journey lie many unresolved mysteries. After the final battle of Amphoreus, Constance “The Dahlia” appears unexpectedly, revealing that the Trailblazer’s memories are incomplete and that some key parts have been stolen. With her assistance and guidance, the Trailblazer will work to piece together a complete and true storyline of Penacony.</p><p>In version 3.8, the Trailblazer will experience the story through Firefly’s perspective: how she initially entered the dreamscape, how she met us, and the battlefields she must face. All these questions will be answered one by one. As we follow her journey, The Family’s seat of power and the Dream of Gnawing Oak will also emerge from the depths of memories. Additionally, Firefly will encounter an old friend, closely connected to her past as a Glamoth Iron Cavalry Knight.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011843"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As a key part of Penacony’s memory-hunting adventure, The Dahlia will also join the roster as a playable character. She arrives in Penacony despite her father Duke Inferno’s grand plans being ultimately abandoned. The Dahlia’s target is the Remembrance, and her power is also related to that path, with the ability to enkindle and fabricate memories. She has a long history with the Garden of Recollection and Black Swan, and it is said that she has grown accustomed to betrayal. Nevertheless, The Dahlia will assist us in reclaiming the lost memories and completing the entire Penaconian trailblazing expedition. These memories hold special significance not only for the Trailblazer, but for her as well.</p><p>The Dahlia, a five-star character following the Path of Nihility, excels when teamed up with characters who specialize in Break DMG. On the battlefield, she can actively unleash a gloomy Zone. While this Zone lasts, Toughness Reduction inflicted by allies can trigger Super Break DMG, even before the enemies have their Weakness Broken. Additionally, as a graceful and elegant dancer, The Dahlia invites a teammate to become “Dance Partners.” After either of the two Dance Partners attacks an enemy target, they will deal an additional instance of Super Break DMG. On that foundation, her Ultimate applies every Dance Partner’s Type Weakness to all enemies, enhancing Toughness Reduction effectiveness.</p><p>Besides, in the upcoming version, a brand-new event titled “The Chrysos Awoo Championship” is set to begin. The Trailblazer, as a special guest, will take on the role of a chimera trainer, leading their own little chimeras to form a powerful team in pursuit of championship glory. Additionally, the event “Remnants of Twilight” will also be available, featuring a variety of battle challenges that will require players to think strategically and act decisively.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.
