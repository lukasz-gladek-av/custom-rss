We have no timeframe or news there.”</p><p>“<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> feels like a natural evolution from its predecessor,” said FuturLab design director Dan Chequer in a press release. “The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean. <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements. We’re really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure.”</p><p>FuturLab chief operating officer Chris Mehers added, “We couldn’t be more thrilled to finally announce the sequel to one of our most successful titles. With over 17 million players worldwide, <em><a title="Games > PowerWash Simulator [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a></em> has allowed us to self-publish a sequel, an exciting challenge we are delighted to undertake. We look forward to bringing players the next step-up in the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> series.”</p><div id="carousel_949354"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via FuturLab:</p><!-- AD: content -->
