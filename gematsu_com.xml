When I first heard about the game, I was absolutely thrilled, and now that it has become a reality, I couldn’t be happier. I was especially surprised to learn that the game is being developed in the Netherlands! It felt amazing to say ‘Tenkamuteki no Daishōri!!’ (‘Unrivaled, ultimate victory!!’) again. I love Yattarou so much!”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichiro Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Hearing Kon-chan (Ko’on-no-Kami) and Gen-chan (Gennarisai) banter, Kenyū-san’s witty narration, and the Nyankī squad’s signature introductions—it was like stepping back into the recording studio from all those years ago. I was also blown away by how faithfully the trailer recreated the original animation style. The love and dedication from the Dutch development team truly shine through. And of course, a big thank you to Seiichiro Yamashita for bringing Sukashii to life!”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Congratulations on 35 years of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>! Over time, I’ve been hearing more and more people say, ‘I loved Teyandee!’ and it makes me so happy. The fact that this series continues to be loved not only in Japan but also overseas is truly special. This is a work that I will cherish forever, and Yattarou will always be an irreplaceable part of my career.”</p><p><strong>■ Ai Orikasa (Pururun)</strong></p><p><strong>How did it feel to record Pururun’s voice again after so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Ai Orikasa:</strong> “I was deeply moved by the quality of the visuals.

Seeing Ko-on-no-Kami and Gennarisai’s interactions was exciting, and I was delighted to say Pururun’s signature catchphrase once again.”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichirō Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even after 35 years, this series remains as vibrant as ever in my heart. The moment I stepped into the studio with Kappei-san and the rest of the team, Pururun’s lines just came naturally. Seiichirō Yamashita did a fantastic job as Sukashii—he really captured the character’s essence.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as Samurai Pizza Cats?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even our post-recording gatherings (laughs) were a blast! I truly believe the camaraderie among the cast and crew translated into what audiences loved about the show. It is such an honor to be part of a series that continues to be cherished after all these years. Please continue to support <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>!”</p><p><strong>■ Seiichiro Yamashita (Sukashii)</strong></p><p><strong>Were you familiar with <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> before? What was your experience recording for the trailer?</strong></p><p><strong>Seiichiro Yamashita:</strong> “To be honest, I wasn’t familiar with Kyatto Ninden Teyandee before this project. It’s incredible to be involved with a series that predates my birth. The recording session was truly special—I had the privilege of performing alongside legends like Kappei Yamaguchi, watching them work up close in such a dynamic setting.”</p><p><strong>How did you feel about taking over the role of Sukashii from your senior colleague Jurota Kosugi?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Even now, I feel like it’s too great an honor to say I’ve ‘inherited’ the role. This is my first time stepping into a character previously portrayed by another actor, and I was deeply conscious of preserving the image of Sukashii that fans hold dear. The encouragement from the production team was invaluable, and this has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Stories have a way of leaving lasting impressions on people, and the love for <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> has endured over decades.
