After you clear the demo, you can even explore a part of a new map, the Sea of Tranquility, where you can have a taste of what comes after.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The player character level is capped at Lv. 5 in the demo, but at your base, the Seeker’s Hideout, you can experience the core gameplay loop: buy and craft items, unlock a wide variety of passive skills, raise your companion the Pui, and feed a giant mussel and receive equipment upgrade items in return.</p><p>The main purpose of this demo is to receive feedback from our players so that we can further improve the game during development. We’ve also set up an official Discord server for players to directly share feedback, so please join in and share your thoughts with us!</p><p><strong>Word from the Developer, Kei Shibuya (Studio Snowblind)</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Glaciered-Demo_11-07-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Over the duration of Tokyo Game Show [2024], many players visited the PLAYISM booth to play the <em>Glaciered</em> event demo. Even early in the day, we already had so many visitors that we needed to give out numbered tickets for people to come back to the queue later. In order to let as many people play the game as possible, we shortened the play time of the demo as much as we could, but still we sometimes had to turn down people due to the long wait times. We’re sorry we couldn’t let everyone who wanted to play the game have a chance to try it out.</p><p>In order to let more people try out <em>Glaciered</em>, we carefully discussed releasing the demo to the public, and now we’re confident that the timing is right.</p><p>We would love it if you could share your feedback with us on the Steam forums or the official Discord server. We’ll take your opinions into consideration as we continue to work hard on development.</p><p>We also have an FAQ section in the Steam news that answers some questions we’ve already received so far, so please take a look at that when you play the demo as well!</p></blockquote><p>Glaciered is due out for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052300/Glaciered/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
