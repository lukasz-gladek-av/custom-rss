            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a title="Companies > Ghost Story Games [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/ghost-story-games">Ghost Story Games</a> creative director Ken Levine has shared an update on single-player, narrative <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> <em><a title="Games > Judas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/judas">Judas</a></em> on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>, including new key art, details on the “Villainy” system that can turn allies into enemies based on player choices, and plans for more frequent developer updates. <span id="more-988584"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p>We know, we know… we’ve been silent for a while. It takes a lot of time and energy to make marketing materials like trailers, and we’re trying to focus all our efforts on finishing <em>Judas</em>.</p><p>But we also miss the days of having a more direct relationship with you, the gamer, so we thought, “Why not start releasing some dev logs?”</p><p>Through these, we hope to communicate more frequently to update you with new details of what we are working on, without spoiling too much of what <em>Judas</em> has in store. The goal is to keep this pretty lo-fi, meaning more frequent updates than before, but not necessarily always with fancy trailers and super polished final imagery. (Though there will be more of those as well!)</p><p><strong>Feature Update: Villainy</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We’ve just finished a major milestone: Villainy. Villainy is a central feature of <em>Judas</em>. When you play <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock—they’re always going to be the bad guys. In <em>Judas</em>, your <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the villain. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals. The clips below demonstrate just a little bit of the feature.</p><p>This is just one example of how the Big 3 can retaliate. The more dangerous and character-specific stuff will be kept a secret, for now.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll have to make decisions about who you’re going to focus your energy on… and who you’ll wind up alienating.</p><p><em>—Want to Rent-A-Deputy?</em></p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-988584-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/DukUCOy.mp4</a></video></p><p><em>—But… be careful not to rent one when Tom is pissed off.</em></p><p><video id="video-988584-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L1HuA9f.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>A Focus on Character</strong></p><p>One of my personal favorites of all time is <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> because of the emergent gameplay made possible by their Nemesis System. The system allows you to develop small relationships with multiple orcs. However, their goals were a little different than ours, because there are so many different orcs and they don’t have time to develop them into characters.</p><p>In <em>Judas</em>, you’re going to get to know these characters intimately. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you’ve got to decide who you trust and who you don’t.</p><p>In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth. By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes and dreams.</p><p>But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In <em>Judas</em>, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, but most importantly your interactions with the other two characters.</p><p>As part of the Villainy <a title="Companies > Milestone S.r.l. [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/milestone-s-r-l">Milestone</a>, we also completed the biggest <em>Judas</em> playtest yet, where new players experienced this feature firsthand. Every time we test, we learn so much, and we love having that level of knowledge when working on the game. The testers shared tons of valuable feedback on the weight of decisions and how it impacted outcomes, their interest in learning more about character motivations, and how moments where the Big 3 helped—or turned on them—changed their future decisions.</p><p><strong>New Key Art</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Judas_08-27-25.jpg"></a></figure><p>Another thing we’re excited to be able to share is… this:</p><p>We’re really happy to finally show this off. I have always personally been a huge fan of Drew Struzan’s work and that era of movie posters. The style is great at presenting films that have a big cast, like Star Wars. And <em>Judas</em> has a big cast. Outside of the lead roles, there’s likely going to be more than one hundred speaking parts… If you look closely, there’s probably some details you might be curious about. Let’s just say there’s some stuff in this game that we’re not going to talk about right now, but everything here is relevant.</p><p>There’s one thing we’re sure you all want to know: <strong>when is <em>Judas</em> coming out?!?!</strong></p><p>While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that. As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it. But we know <em>Judas</em> is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/judas-reveals-new-key-art-villainy-system]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A “Deluxe Edition” will also be available for $44.99, which includes the following content:</p><p>Netmarble also released a <a href="https://slvariseoverdrive.netmarble.com/en/news/1/3" target="_blank">Developer Note</a> detailing the core gameplay features and philosophy behind the game, emphasizing that the game is a premium title separate from the mobile game&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Solo Leveling: ARISE" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/solo-leveling-arise">Solo Leveling: ARISE</a></em>, in which Hunters, weapons for Sung Jinwoo and other Hunters, and growth systems are unlocked through gameplay. It also elaborates on creating a distinct experience for consoles and PC, with standalone systems, narrative depth, and controls.</p><div><p><strong>■ Greetings, Hunters!</strong></p><p>I am Kim Gwang Hoon, the development producer of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>We are thrilled to greet you for the first time as the development team behind <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>With <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> already receiving so much love, developing a new game for PC and console players has brought us not only great excitement and anticipation but also a fair share of fear and serious contemplation about venturing into the unknown.</p><p>Still, the desire to reinterpret the epic journey of <em>Solo Leveling</em> in a new dimension, and to present new experiences and deeper gameplay aimed at PC and console that couldn’t be explored in <em>ARISE</em>, has driven our strong spirit of challenge. <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is our bold new venture.</p><p>We understand that many of you may have questions about our new game.</p><p>To the current players of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>, we deeply empathize with your feelings that the arrival of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> might mean we’re turning our attention away from <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>. And to those of you waiting for <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, we also recognize the concern that it might end up as nothing more than a simple port of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>.</p><p>But please rest assured, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is an entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> will continue to evolve on its own path, aiming to provide the best possible gameplay experience. At the same time, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed as a distinct PC/console title with its own unique identity. We are doing our utmost to ensure that both projects live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, allow us to share more about how <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a New Game <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong></p><p>What we would like to emphasize first and foremost is that <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a full-package game. Rather than relying on randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons, we’ve designed the game to reward effort and strategy, allowing you to feel a true sense of achievement. All the Hunters, Sung Jinwoo and their weapons, and the joy of progression can be earned and enjoyed entirely through in-game play.</p><p><strong>Hunter Recruitment</strong></p><p>By Sung Jinwoo’s side stands not only his shadows, but also many skilled Hunters who fight alongside him. In <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, you can offer each Hunter a payment worthy of their abilities and recruit them to join you in battle.</p><p><strong>Weapon <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a></strong></p><p>As a player, you can directly choose and craft your own weapons. Defeat powerful bosses and use the materials you obtain to forge formidable weapons for Sung Jinwoo and the Hunters. By combining various weapons and skill trees, you’ll be able to create a unique combat style that’s entirely your own.</p><p><strong>■ What Sets <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> Apart</strong></p><p>The passion of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> now burns anew on PC and console with <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is built upon two core values.</p><p>First, <strong>deeper and more refined <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a></strong>.</p><p>We’ve designed the controls to suit PC and console platforms, maximizing the thrill of weighty and precise combat.</p><p>Second, <strong>overwhelming immersion</strong>.</p><p>A world brought to life with next-level PC and console graphics that will fully draw fans into the game’s story, delivering a truly immersive experience.</p><p><strong>■ Visuals That Deepen Immersion</strong></p><p>We’ve pushed the visual quality of the game to its highest level, so that you can become fully immersed in the world of <em>Solo Leveling</em>.</p><p><strong>Background Level Up</strong></p><p>Now, You Are There. To bring the iconic moments from the webtoon to life more vividly, we’ve significantly enhanced the detail and quality of the game’s environments. Though the game is based on the original webtoon, the backgrounds are portrayed in a style that bridges the gap between comic and realism, allowing you to not only feel as if you’ve stepped into the webtoon itself, but to experience a whole new level of immersion.</p><p><strong>Character Level Up</strong></p><p>A brand-new customization system has been added, just for you.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo: Styled, Chosen, Completed by You</strong></p><p>You can personalize Sung Jinwoo by selecting his hairstyle and hair color, and equipping various facial accessories to create a version of him that’s truly one of a kind.</p><p><strong>Highlight Your <a title="Genres > Party [104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>‘s <a title="Series > Persona [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lity</strong></p><p>You can also freely change the hair color of your fellow Hunters, letting their individuality shine even more. Mix and match hairstyles and colors across multiple Hunters to create a party that reflects your unique style.</p><p><strong>■ Combat with Strategic Depth</strong></p><p>We’ve built a combat system that goes beyond simple <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a>, maximizing the thrill of strategic decision-making and precise control.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo Skill Tree</strong></p><p>Sung Jinwoo’s growth is entirely in your hands. Choose and develop various skill trees, even the same Jinwoo can have a completely different combat style depending on your decisions. Grow him your way, with your own strategy.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 1: The Monarch System</strong></p><p>It’s Time to Turn the Tide of Battle. We’ve implemented a Monarch Transformation system, a powerful feature that lets Sung Jinwoo awaken as the Monarch of Shadows. In this form, Jinwoo unleashes devastating skills that overwhelm enemies and dominate the battlefield. Based on your feedback, we’re actively enhancing the impact and speed of combat to deliver an even more intense and overwhelming battle experience. Get ready for a fight that feels truly powerful.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 2: Parry System</strong></p><p>Take command of the battlefield. The parry system lets you precisely block enemy attacks, offering the thrill of skillful control and heightening the tension of each encounter. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully parry an attack to trigger a QTE, allowing you to exploit enemy openings and land a devastating counterstrike.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 3: <a title="Companies > Enhance [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Hit Impact and Damage Feedback</strong></p><p>Feel every moment of battle as if you were truly there.

For example, when using the “Duel” skill tree, a special gauge will appear on the battle HUD. Once this gauge is filled to 100%, you can unleash a powerful skill specialized for that tree.</p><p>Hunters can showcase their individuality in combat through their own unique Overdrive Systems. For example, the Hunter Choi Jong-In can unleash meteors around him after applying Burn to enemies a certain number of times, shaking the battlefield with abilities that highlight his distinctive traits.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Battle Even More 2: Chain Smash System</strong></p><p>The Chain Smash System is a core mechanic that maximizes the synergy between skills. Triggered through additional input right after using a skill, Chain Smash grows stronger the more you chain it together.</p><p>By strategically deciding when to activate Chain Smash during your combos, you’ll experience an entirely new level of combat excitement.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>‘s Variety of Content</strong></p><p><strong>Cute Companion, Yaruru</strong></p><p>Adorable shadows have flown in from another world to assist Hunters.
