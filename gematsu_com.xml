I hope our efforts are felt through the song, and that you’ll enjoy the game as much as I do.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via <a title="Companies > Team Meat [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-meat">Team Meat</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em> is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar—in 3D! You’ll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way—in (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before—in (say it with me!) 3D!</p><!-- AD: content -->
