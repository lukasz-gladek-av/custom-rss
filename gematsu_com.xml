An Algox messenger arrives, bringing information about a possible resolution. Now the heroes of Frosthaven must decide the fate of the Algox and shape the legacy that will define their future. Something ancient and malevolent stirs beneath the ice.</p><p>Adding to a storyline filled with political intrigue and cooperation, three new character classes—“Astral,” “Drill,” and “Shackles”—introduce playstyles and abilities that will dynamically shape party builds and strategies:</p><ul><li>“Shackles” developed the ability to control pain itself, redirecting damage and harmful effects from his allies and aiming it towards the enemy.</li><li>“Drill,” an ancient machine made from various Unfettered parts, is a heavy-lifting tank class and offers melee combat and impressive defensive capabilities.</li><li>“Astral” is attuned to the elements, utilizing them to empower attacks, heal, and if needed, even manifest crystalline weapons to their aid.</li></ul><p>Also joining these heroes is an additional pet, totaling 11 pets so far for players to discover and capture! Summon your pets from the Stables, bring them into battle, and activate unique and powerful abilities, adding strategic depth beyond standard item cards.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
