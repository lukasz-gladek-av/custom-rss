With limited development resources, we chose to focus exclusively on the Nintendo Switch to ensure the best possible experience for players. We appreciate your understanding and support in this decision.</p><p>For many fans, this is the first opportunity to enjoy <em>Strania EX</em>, as its availability in arcades was extremely limited. Whether you’re revisiting the game or experiencing it for the first time, we believe this release will provide an unforgettable adventure!</p><p>This release marks our first self-published release in 12 years! It’s a cautious yet thrilling “restart” for us, and we’re deeply grateful for your continued support as we embark on this new chapter.</p><p>– Hiroyuki Maruyama, Producer</p></blockquote><p>View a set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/strania-the-stella-machina-ex/january-7-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_937275"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
