Dan and I grew up playing capture the flag in the woods at night with flashlights, friends, and lots of adrenaline. <em>Last Flag</em> is our attempt to honor the purity and magic of that hide and seek experience—brought to life by the incredible team of developers we’re lucky enough to stand beside.”</p><div id="carousel_968642"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Night Street Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>It’s 197X.

        <p>Welcome to <em>Last Flag</em>—the game where fame, fortune, and your flag are all up for grabs.</p><p>Two teams. Two hidden flags. One shot at immortality.</p><p>Stash your flag. Find theirs. Snatch it. Run it back. Win.</p><p>The world is watching, so don’t forget to do it with style.</p><p>This isn’t war. This is showbiz.</p><p>From Night Street Games—an indie studio co-founded by Mac and Dan Reynolds (yep, from Imagine Dragons)—<em>Last Flag</em> is a five-versus-five team <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,136 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> built to bring CTF center stage. It’s fast, it’s fun, and delivers 20 minutes or less of non-stop chaos, clutch comebacks, and buzzer-beating plays.</p><p>You don’t get eliminated. You get vacuum-tubed off the set and reappear in the green room, ready to FWOOMP yourself back to a radar tower you control—or straight to your base.</p><p>Set in a funk-blasted 1970s-inspired universe, Last Flag transforms players into Contestants on the world’s most-watched game show—hosted by the mysterious media mogul Victor Fex.</p><p>When the cameras start rolling, players leap into an outdoor arena to hide their team’s flag, then scramble to reveal the enemy’s location by controlling radar towers and scouring the map’s multitude of hidden nooks and crannies.</p><p>Capture the flag. Haul it home. Defend it for one minute to win it.</p><p>Whether you’re celebrating your victory or vibing to the smooth sounds of defeat, you can always choose to run it back.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>CTF is the Main Event</strong> – Built from the ground up for Capture the Flag.

Whether you’re stealing flags as Soo-Jin, the <a title="Genres > Stealth [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>y master thief, or locking enemies down with Julius Reeves’ Jail Cell—you can dig it—this crew was built to steal the show.</li><li><strong>Themed Maps Set the Stage for Epic <a title="Genres > Action [2,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a></strong> – Each colorful outdoor map was built to encourage exploration, thrilling team fights, and offers plenty of out-of-the-way hiding spots for concealing the flag. But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows in <em>Last Flag</em>… there may be more than meets the eye.</li><li><strong>Original Soundtrack by Dan Reynolds and Friends</strong> – Fuzzy guitars, analog synths, and legit 1970s studio magic, crafted with real vintage gear by Dan, Grammy-nominated producer / writer JT Daly (Benson Boone, K.Flay, Bully), and Night Street Games’ own soundsmith Dave Lowmiller (<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em><a title="Games > Dead Space (2023) [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dead-space-2023">Dead Space</a></em>).</li><li><strong>Casually Competitive</strong> – No pressure.
