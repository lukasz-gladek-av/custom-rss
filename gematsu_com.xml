Despite his rough-and-ready demeanor, Takemaru’s really a nice guy on the inside. Impulsive, straightforward, and honorable to a fault, he’s sworn to never use his strength to bully the weak.</li><li><strong>Shouma Ginzaki</strong> (voiced by Shun Horie) – A young man who, by his own admission, has absolutely nothing going for him. On a scale of one to ten, his self-esteem’s at negative five. He’s constantly putting himself down.</li><li><strong>Moko Mojiro</strong> (voiced by Kukuko Inoue) – A young woman who is blowing up on the high school pro <a title="Genres > Wrestling [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/wrestling">wrestling</a> scene. Her courage and boundless energy is a source of inspiration for the entire Special Defense Unit. Whenever she has a problem, she faces it head on. She didn’t choose the wrasslin’ life—it chose her.</li><li><strong>Nigou</strong> (voiced by Ikue Otani) – Sirei’s assistant and second in command. An odd little robot that has a gentle, caring personality, but is also prone to making careless mistakes. He’s completely loyal and subservient to Sirei.</li><li><strong>Nozomi Kirifuji</strong> (voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa) – A high schooler who combines a kindhearted nature with dogged determination in battle. She’s very passionate about the Special Defense Unit’s mission, but also seems to be hiding something. For some reason, Nozomi is identical in appearance to Takumi’s childhood friend Karua.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,627 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,310 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 24 worldwide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
