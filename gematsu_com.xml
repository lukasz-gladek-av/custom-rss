    <p><span>The return of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > 2K [673 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/2k">2K</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gearbox Software [248 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-gearbox-entertainment-company/gearbox-software">Gearbox Software</a> have detailed the endgame and post-launch content coming to <em><a title="Games > Borderlands 4 [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a></em>, including “Story Pack” and “Bounty Pack” downloadable content, new boss battles, seasonal events, and the return of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. <span id="more-989342"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Endgame</strong></p><p><em>Borderlands 4</em> does not end when the story concludes, as players can look forward to a comprehensive endgame experience focused on obtaining the best loot possible on Kairos. Players will experience progression through weekly challenge missions, unlockable Specializations to further customize their loadout, and the return of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li><li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li><li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li></ul><p><strong>Post-Launch Roadmap</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

The paid downloadable content includes two types of major offerings: “Story Pack” and “Bounty Pack.”</p><ul><li><strong>Story Packs</strong> – The first of two announced “Story Packs” features the return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie in “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned.” Featuring a cosmic <a title="Genres > Horror [699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> theme with a bloodier, darker tone, this “Story Pack” includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, all new legendary gear, and the introduction of the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li><li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe. These missions will reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, starting with Rush, the gregarious leader of the <a title="Games > Outbound [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outbound">Outbound</a>ers. Each Bounty Pack includes new Main Missions, a new boss, new Legendary Gear, one Player Skin, one ECHO-4 Drone Skin, one new Vehicle, and a Vault Card, allowing players to unlock 24 Cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable Gear.</li></ul><p>Additionally, available as free content to all players, Seasonal Mini-Events kicking off in October with Horrors of Kairos offer new Legendary Weapons, new Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant.

    <p><span>A wholesome adventure from ToeJam &amp; Earl Doki-Doki Universe creator Greg Johnson.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > HumaNature Studios" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/humanature-studios">HumaNature Studios</a>, the studio led by <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> and <em>Doki-Doki Universe</em> creator Greg Johnson, has announced <em><a title="Games > Dancing with Ghosts" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dancing-with-ghosts">Dancing with Ghosts</a></em>, a life <a title="Genres > Simulation [824 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> about finding joy from grief. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,593 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanaturestudios/dancing-with-ghosts" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> will launch in October. <span id="more-989314"></span></p><p>The story follows Mai, a 15 year-old Thai girl who feels lost and overcome with guilt after the death of her parents. She meets an 11 year-old ghost, who lost her memory and is trapped in this world.</p><p>The idea came to be after the passing of Johnson’s 28-year-old daughter, and his family’s loss of everything in the 2023 Lahaina fires.</p><p>“I’ve been through some difficult times in my life, but I always remember the people who reached out, and tried to bring some light when things were dark,” said HumaNature Studios founder and <em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> creator Greg Johnson in a press release. “My team and I are making <em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> to bring joy to people who need it, and we hope you support our efforts to bring this to the world.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via HumaNature Studios:</p><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is a wholesome, interactive-narrative with a compelling, heartfelt story full of charm and humor. The interactive narrative is set within the chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village. Players play the role of Mai, a 15 year old Thai girl who feels lost and overcome with guilt because of the death of her parents. Mai meets an 11 year old ghost, who has lost her memory and who is trapped in this world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Mai is the only one who can see the ghost, and there is a reason why their fates are tied together. Mai decides to help the ghost remember who she was and fulfill her dream so she can move on. Ironically, Mai, the living girl, struggles to enjoy life, while the ghost girl is full of vibrancy and life. Mai sets out to help the ghost, but it is really the ghost that teaches Mai how to be fully alive.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_989317"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is at the heart of the story and at the heart of the gameplay. The story bravely dives into questions about life and death, with heart and sensitivity. It explores themes of self-forgiveness, acceptance, empathy for the struggles of others, and even romance… well, in a very innocent and sweet way.</p><p>Players get to play both as Mai and as the ghost. As Mai you help others in the village and earn good Karma to help Pim on her way. You play cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story.</p><p>Players also play as the ghost, entering the minds of everyone in the village and hearing their thoughts. The ghost is able to help these people by bringing them “Heartlights” for positive energy, and is able to hear what their needs are and then communicate this to Mai, who can then help them.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
