We’re retro-fitting Online into an originally single player game written in JavaScript by a solo dev, so there are a lot of technical issues we have to move around or worry about later, one of which is the way that downloadable content expansions are handled.</li><li><strong>Free Roam</strong> – In online you are not restricted to the same screen, you can all freely move around the stage independently. (Note: You will be pulled into a boss room if any player walks into it.)</li><li><strong>Spectator Mode</strong> – When you die in <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [628 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> you can use the mouse to jump to players who are still alive.

Even in 2099 the rule about messing with your unlucky subjects still remains in this sequel: DO NOT feed the monkeys!</p><p><em>The Primate Observation Club is still active and stronger than ever in the year 2099.

        <p>Life is about to get a little meta…</p><p>Do you like power? How about controlling the lives of others?<br>Do you like breaking rules? Does it excite you? Maybe “Rebel” is your middle name?<br>Do you want to be part of an exclusive group? Be someone important?<br>Do you want to make some money and become rich?</p><p>If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you’re in luck! You’ve been invited to join The Primate Observation Club. Live out all your heart’s desires as the newest member and if you are already in the Club, it’s time to move up the ladder.</p><p>Observe the monkeys behind cages from the comfort of your home, stash some cash with your side hustle jobs, and maybe even play the role of a divine being by manipulating the lives of your subjects.

Pick up side jobs for money, all the while avoiding that wacky conspiracy theorist next door.</li><li><strong>Definitely Not Feeding the Monkeys</strong> – Get to know the subjects and you might get the chance to interact with them. Hack security systems, make threatening phone calls or even put your own flavor on an unusual beverage. But then forget all those things, because that’s against Club rules!</li><li><strong>New Game, New Technology</strong> – For previous Club member alumni, you’ll notice we’ve also added some community-requested features beyond the new game experience.<ul><li><strong>An OmniPal</strong> – Gone are the days of surveillance solitude. OmniPals are artificial intelligence represented by holograms that act as promoters of companies. OmniPals are another window into the outside world and may offer some other mysterious functions.</li><li><strong>End-Game Content</strong> – Once you’ve finished the game, new and exciting features such as a Fast Forwarding ability will be available. Who knows what other rewards await you!</li><li><strong>A Peephole</strong> – Peepholes aren’t standard equipment, but eventually you’ll be able to get one.
