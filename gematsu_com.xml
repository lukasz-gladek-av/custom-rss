        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>“Let’s have a little reunion, just the four of us.”</p><p>Remon, Shian, Murasaki, and Korone—a group of four close friends who were considered “oddballs” back in middle school.</p><p>Over time, they drifted apart, each leading their own high school lives. In the summer of their third year in high school, Korone—the lively mood maker who brought the oddballs together—reaches out after a long time.</p><p>Looking forward to their reunion, they all arrive at the meeting place… or so they thought.</p><p>When they regain consciousness, they find themselves in a small room with no exit. The room is decorated as if themed after <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. In each corner of the square room, there is a chair and a table for each girl, as well as a lovely tea set. And also, long chains that extend from each chair, connected to the collars around the girls’ necks…</p><p>The “reunion” has become a death game—a battle of life and death to settle the past…!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planned and Written by Ryukishi07</strong> – This is the second entry in Entergram’s “Girls Mental Suspense” series, following <em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</em>. In this installment, the participants engage in a death game in a new setting.</li><li><strong>A Scenario That Unfolds From Each Character’s Perspective</strong> – In this game, players will experience a game of life and death set in a mysterious room, from the perspective of each character. The story depicts in depth the characters’ inner thoughts as they navigate the game’s challenges, enhancing immersion and exploring their interpersonal relationships.</li><li><strong>Take On Multiple Games</strong> – The previous game, <em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</em>, revolved around a death game with a single rule. This time, multiple games will be featured, ensuring a more varied experience.</li><li><strong>A Fully Voiced Story with an All-Star Cast</strong> – All character dialogue will be fully voiced, with additional voice performances for certain psychological descriptions and other non-dialogue elements. The voice cast will be announced soon, so stay tuned for updates!</li><li><strong>Background Music by HiguUmiSound</strong> – HiguUmiSound, known for composing music for many of Ryukishi07’s works, will once again handle the soundtrack, as it did for <em>Kaleidoscope of Phantom Prison</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots <a href="https://gallery/kaleidoscope-of-phantom-prison-ii/october-24-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_923850"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
