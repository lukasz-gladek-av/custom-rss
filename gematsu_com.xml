        <p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><p>In a world of swords, magic, and fairies, you are a lone adventurer who suddenly becomes tasked to revive the ruined kingdom of Almacia along with the Fairy of Time, Chronos.</p><p>Through adventure (action) and revival (strategy), restore the kingdom to its former glory!</p></blockquote><!-- zp_shiv error: no images in gallery! --><blockquote><p><strong>■ Playable Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Imperial</strong></p><p>With high defense, Imperial is your reliable close-range fighter.</p><p>Her shield gives her guard abilities that allow her to safely get into range for her sword. Her easy-to-use skills, together with her unique counter action, give her a high maximum damage output.</p><p><strong>Alchemist</strong></p><p>Alchemist specializes in mixing potions to inflict statuses and other effects on enemies. Change the element of his bottles with a unique action, then inflict the perfect status effect for the situation.</p><p>His skills also apply a variety of debuffs, allowing him to consistently weaken his enemies.</p><p>Conversely, he has few direct attacks, so he’ll need to focus on status effects while he fights.</p><p><strong>Wizard</strong></p><p>Wizard fights from long range using a variety of magic attacks.</p><p>Her charge action can power up her magic before she casts it. Most of her actions will use SP (skill points), so you’ll need to keep an eye on it.</p><p>Her health and defense is low, so positioning is of utmost importance.</p><p><strong>Zipangu</strong></p><p>Skilled at attacking and dodging, Zipangu’s specialty is consecutive attacks.</p><p>He can get in close with a dodge move, then press the attack harder than any other character.</p><p>What he wants to do is rather simple: dodge, then attack back. However, his defense is lacking, so failing to dodge will be painful.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Each action demands purpose; every misstep can be fatal.</p><p>After each victory, choose your next path and grow stronger. The mightier you become, the deadlier your future foes will be.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Since the day Onis rose from the depths of hell, calamity has plagued the land. Even on the rare occasion that one was slain, its soul would simply return to a new body, and the endless cycle of death and devastation continued without pause.</p><p>Amid this despair, a divine Sakura tree took root. Blessed by the Gods, this sacred tree is a divine vessel capable of sealing Oni souls and preventing their rebirth. This miracle came to be known as Onikura.</p><p>But the Onis still need to be defeated, so brave warriors from every corner of the land took up their swords and set out to destroy the Oni and deliver their souls to the great Sakura tree. But none ever returned—but one.</p><p>You are Tensai, the final Onikura Samurai—a human-god resonance born at the village where the divine Sakura tree took root. Your sword is the world’s last hope. You will hunt down the remaining Onis, seal their corrupted souls within Onikura, and bring an end to the cycle once and for all.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1012579"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Every time an Oni is sealed, its soul is purified by the divine Sakura tree, transforming into Omamori—talismans that bless Tensai with unique abilities. </p><p>Before each encounter, freely combine Omamori to forge your own combat style. Will you master flawless parries, sacrifice your life in exchange for deadly strikes, or channel spiritual energy to control the arena from afar?</p><p>There is no ultimate build—only your path as the true Onikura Samurai.</p><p><strong>Art Style</strong></p><p>Featuring meticulously hand-crafted, high-frame pixel art, <em>Onikura</em> fuses oriental elegance with a haunting post-apocalyptic world set in Ancient Japan. </p><p>Every duel with the Oni unfolds in a special arena—ruined shrines, war-torn villages, and blood-soaked sakura groves. Each Oni carries its own backstory. Beneath the petals of the divine Sakura Tree, only your brave sword can decide the fate of the world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
