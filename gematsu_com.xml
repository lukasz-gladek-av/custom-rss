It will be available both physically and digitally. It will also be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-956731"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via 11 bit studios:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>The Alters</em>, the upcoming <a title="Genres > Science-Fiction [77 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/science-fiction">science-fiction game</a> from 11 bit studios (makers of <em>This War of Mine</em> and <em>Frostpunk</em>), where survival has never been so personal, the path to salvation begins with a question as old as humanity: What if I had chosen differently?</p><p>Stranded on a hostile planet and racing against a deadly sunrise, Jan Dolski’s only chance of survival is to create “alters”—alternate versions of himself shaped by roads not taken. Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage.</p><p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives.</p><p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Blending survival, base-building, exploration, and emotional storytelling, The Alters is a deeply personal sci-fi experience where every decision matters—and every version of you has something to say about it.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Alters | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
