Roll the dice as you fight for your life against menacing monsters, loot and plunder treasure-filled halls and chests, and uncover long-forgotten secrets in a nostalgic throwback inspired by classic <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaigns of the 70s and 80s. The Secret of Weepstone blends Talesworth’s signature innovative approach to design with an ominous dark-fantasy atmosphere and a storyline you’d expect from a DreadXP title, all wrapped up in a memorable visual style that brings the grim affair to life.</p><p>In the shadow of a crumbling abandoned keep lies the forsaken village of Weepstone. Once a thriving settlement, it now withers in silence, fields barren, crops dead, people in fear. Byron, Lord of Weepstone, is ill and bedridden, haunted by night terrors of unholy rituals and unknowable forces. With no champions to call upon, it falls to the commonfolk of the town to face the unknown, confront whatever powers are to blame, and discover the secrets that are held within the crumbling walls. This is not a tale of heroes, this is a tale of those who do what they must to survive.</p><p><em>The Secret of Weepstone</em> is a dungeon-crawling RPG rendered entirely in striking hand-drawn black and white, an atmospheric love letter to the tabletop <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,458 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and art of the 70s and 80s.
