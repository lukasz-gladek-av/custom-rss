    <p><span>Nioh series surpasses 10 million copies sold.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Total sales for <em><a title="Games > Nioh 3 [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a></em> have surpassed one million units worldwide, publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Team NINJA [668 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/team-ninja">Team NINJA</a> <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/news/20260220.html" target="_blank">announced</a>. It reached the one million mark faster than any previous <em>Nioh</em> game. The series has now reached a total of over 10 million copies sold. <span id="more-1028147"></span></p><p><em>Nioh 3</em> launched for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,477 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 6.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Koei Tecmo:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>Nioh 3</em>, players take on the role of Tokugawa Takechiyo, poised to become the next shogun during Japan’s prosperous Edo period. In the shadows, Takechiyo’s younger brother, Tokugawa Kunimatsu, is consumed by jealousy towards his sibling. Empowered by a sinister force, he plots to overthrow Takechiyo and leads a horde of yokai, abruptly ending the era of peace and plunging Japan into hell. Guided by the mysterious power of their Guardian Spirit Kusanagi, Takechiyo transcends time to rescue a land in dire straits and become shogun.</p><p>The story of <em>Nioh 3</em> unfolds on a larger scale than ever before in series history. Covering various eras and regions, including Edo Castle, the Totomi region during the Warring States period, the Heian period’s capital city of Kyoto, and, for the first time in the franchise’s history, the Bakumatsu period. Players will be able to freely explore each era as a vast open field featuring beautiful and distinct environments.</p><p><em>Nioh 3</em> introduces two distinct combat styles, Samurai and Ninja, that players can freely switch between during the heat of battle. The Samurai Style captures <em>Nioh</em>‘s foundational, grounded combat experience, while introducing the new Arts Proficiency system to enhance Martial Arts abilities. In addition, the new Deflect mechanic allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment to turn the tide of battle against deadly adversaries.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In contrast to Samurai Style, Ninja Style excels in agility, enabling players to swiftly dodge and perform aerial attacks while employing various Ninjutsu techniques to attack outside of enemy range. Ninja Style also features the Mist technique, which leaves an afterimage following an attack to momentarily distract enemies, as well as the Evade technique to narrowly avoid enemy strikes. Both techniques will help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating swift attacks from behind.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Accolades Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Accolades Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xr6MIWX29jA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『仁王３』アコレードトレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrdLtgaQnA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/nioh-3-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > ManaVoid Entertainment [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/manavoid-entertainment">ManaVoid Entertainment</a> has announced <em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan</em> sequel <em><a title="Games > Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rainbow-billy-the-book-of-fears">Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4157340/Rainbow_Billy_The_Book_of_Fears" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1027364"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ManaVoid Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Billy is a little older now. And the world feels different.</p><p>In <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>, you step into a more introspective chapter of Billy’s journey, one shaped by adolescence, doubts, and the fears that quietly grow with us.</p><p>Rather than jumping and running through obstacles, Billy now observes, questions, and listens. The game unfolds as a narrative investigation, where understanding others and making sense of emotions takes precedence over <a title="Genres > Action [3,425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Billy explores the world, he encounters strange creatures known as Fearlings—manifestations of fears, anxieties, and unresolved feelings. These encounters are not about defeating enemies, but about understanding what troubles them, and, through them, understanding yourself.</p><p>Each situation invites you to investigate environments, gather clues, engage in dialogue, and piece together emotional puzzles. Choices matter, not because they lead to victory or failure, but because they shape Billy’s outlook on fear, empathy, and growth.</p><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em> is a melancholic, thoughtful journey about growing up, learning to name your fears, and realizing that understanding them is often the bravest thing you can do.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027370"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Themes</strong></p><ul><li>Growing up and emotional change.</li><li>Fear, anxiety, and self-discovery.</li><li>Empathy over confrontation.</li><li>Understanding others as a way to understand yourself.</li><li>Nostalgia for childhood / adolescence.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven investigation gameplay.</li><li>Exploration and environmental observation.</li><li>Dialogue-based progression.</li><li>Emotional and symbolic confrontations with Fearlings.</li><li>A slower, reflective pace focused on mood and introspection.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Narrative Investigation</strong> – Explore environments, observe details, and piece together emotional clues to progress.</li><li><strong>Empathy-Based Encounters</strong> – Face Fearlings not as enemies, but as manifestations of inner struggles to be understood.</li><li><strong>Introspective Storytelling</strong> – A more mature and melancholic tone, reflecting adolescence and emotional growth.</li><li><strong>Same Universe, New <a title="Companies > Experience [215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Set in the Rainbow Billy world, but offering a fresh gameplay approach distinct from the first game.</li><li><strong>Stylized Art Direction</strong> – A colorful yet subdued visual style that mirrors the contrast between childhood wonder and growing emotional complexity.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
