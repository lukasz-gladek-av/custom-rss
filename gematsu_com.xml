This new entry into <em>Breakout</em> lore will challenge players not just to break every brick, but to creatively breach the wall with score-building combos. <em>Breakout Beyond</em> features a whole new sideways perspective, 72 levels for players to blast through, and two-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, designed to share the high-octane brick-breaking with a friend.</p><p>In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 <a title="Genres > Arcade [71 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a>, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>Featuring 72 challenging levels, players’ brick-blasting skills will be pushed to the brink—but they won’t need to face the challenge alone. Block-breakers can forgo going solo and team up with a friend for local two-player cooperative play and tackle the mayhem together. Alternatively, a new focus mode slows down time, sacrificing a higher score for greater control.</p><!-- AD: content -->
