For the first time ever, players can physically shake their controller to shake the rat—an absurd, satisfying mechanic brought to life with detailed motion input and hyper-reactive feedback.</p><p><strong>What is <em>RATSHAKER</em>?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At its core, <em>RATSHAKER</em> is a satirical, physics-based first-person game about solving problems the old-fashioned way—by grabbing a rat and shaking the ever-loving squeak out of it. It’s weird. It’s dark. And somehow, it’s deeply cathartic.</p><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gyro-Powered Pest Control</strong> – Shake your DualSense to physically control your in-game rat.</li><li><strong>Hyper-Realistic RAT Physics</strong> – Every flail, flop, and squeal has been finely tuned for tactile feedback.</li><li><strong>Effortless Pest Removal</strong> – Just grab, shake, and watch as your “problems” disappear.</li><li><strong>Your rat responds to every shake</strong>… sometimes unexpectedly.</li><li><strong>No Traps. No Mess. (Some Guilt.)</strong> – A clean conscience not included.</li></ul><p><strong>A Darkly Hilarious Journey</strong></p><p><em>RATSHAKER</em> is the fun and quirky solution to all your rat problems! Hold on to the RAT, shake your arm, and watch life’s problems disappear! How far can you go?</p><p>This is your chance to shake, rattle, and roll in the most ridiculous way possible—only on PlayStation.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Ratshaker: Official PS5 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIrYRaWOdt8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
