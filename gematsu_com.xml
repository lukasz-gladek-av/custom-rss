Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>2026 will bring a number of major updates to the game, kicking off with the player character update landing in the first quarter. Players will be able to update their ghost hunter with free cosmetics, with new character models and fine-tuned animations also being added; including equipment swapping, injecting tier three sanity medication, and new death and revive animations.</p><p>Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year. Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game’s launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0.</p><p>Alongside this, the genre-defining horror game will also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, following a successful release on PlayStation and Xbox in 2024. A Unity 6 and network update will also be rolling out across platforms, meaning a smoother gameplay experience for players.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Two map reworks will also be on the way as Tanglewood and 13  Willow Street  will both be getting revamped. Whilst Tanglewood’s map layout will remain similar to the original, players can expect a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes and more. For those with a keen eye, there’s also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>That’s not all, as there will be plenty more spooktacular surprises in store. A new map and one time event is also set to roll out, alongside the return of fan favourite seasonal events with Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye and Winter’s Jest all returning for the year.</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> with <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/phasmophobia-2026-roadmap-announced]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>First new entry in the Tomodachi Life series in more than 10 years.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></em>, the first new entry in the <em>Tomodachi Life</em> series in more than 10 years, will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on April 16, <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [23,491 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260129403327/en/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1021708"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><p>In the <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> game, players can create Mii characters based on family, friends and anyone they can imagine, and have them inhabit a vibrant, eclectic island where almost anything can happen. Customize Mii characters right down to their personalities, little quirks and living spaces, then see what weird and wonderful things they’ll get up to. Give them an occasional nudge to divulge what’s on their minds, help them solve life’s problems, cultivate their friendships and more. In this game, time passes the same way as the real world, so try and drop in on your Mii characters daily as they continue to live their best island lives!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022377"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>See below for more detailed information on the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Mii Characters With Character</strong> – In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, players can fully customize and envision Mii characters as family, friends and more. Your experience can differ based on the Miis you create as residents, so feel free to experiment and grow your island population!</li><li><strong>Create Many Miis</strong> – There are two ways to create Mii characters: Choose “Get Help” to answer questions about their facial features, or “From Scratch” to select from various face types, hairstyles, eyes and more. There are many parts to choose from, some of which are new to this game, and you can create even more imaginative looking Miis with robust face paint options, too. After that, you can customize their name, height, body type, gender, voice and aspects of their personality, including how quirky they are, their energy levels and more.</li><li><strong>Help Residents Connect</strong> – Once created, Miis will need some help getting on their feet. One way to do this is to bring various residents together. Drop Miis near each other and different situations might play out: They may discuss their favorite foods or bond over their love of monster trucks. Once acquainted, the Miis will be able to interact on their own. You can also have up to eight residents live together as roommates, and they’ll react differently when sharing a home. With multiple Miis under one roof, some unexpected dramas may unfold!</li><li><strong>Visit Island Shops and Facilities</strong> – Help Miis discover their favorite eats and culinary curiosities at Fresh Kingdom food mart; pick up a range of everyday attire and out-there outfits at Where &amp; Wear clothing; revamp rooms and living spaces at T&amp;C Reno home supply (there are even rooms for Miis who dream of sleeping in a supermarket or a library!); shop for reasonably priced items that change depending on the time of day at the Marketplace; gather island decorations at Quik Build amenities; tune into the MNN news station to keep up with the Miis and everyday happenings on the island; and stage a fun photo op for Miis at Foto-Tomo photography and more.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Palette [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/palette">Palette</a> House Workshop</strong> – Create a wide range of elements at this artsy workshop to further enliven island life! Design pets for Mii characters, draft up custom drinks, sketch a resident’s favorite TV show, decorate a special item of clothing, draw the exterior of a house and ground tiles, and go wild by creating original items for your island, too.</li><li><strong>Make Your Island Yours</strong> – Change up your island’s aesthetic with landscape items, such as trees, plants, benches, vending machines, bouncy playground rides and more. Move shops and houses around, expand areas of land, and more based on suggestions from residents or personal preference.</li><li><strong>More Ways to Customize</strong> – And add some flourishes to Mii characters by gifting them little quirks that can give them even more individuality, like poses they may strike, how they enjoy their food or having them toss and turn while they sleep, for example. You can also gift them favorite phrases to spice up their sentences. Try finding little quirks that fit each Mii!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

The returning cards were created by a generative AI model called “AI KANEKO,” that would generate new art trained on works from Kazuma Kaneko based on player <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s and decisions within the original game. <em>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</em> for the <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> is an offline title and does not utilize generative AI to create new cards.</p><p>“As generative AI emerged, I had a desire as an artist to create something with this new technology in a similar way when digital art evolved from pen and paper,” said Kazuma Kaneko in a press release. “As this desire took shape we created and released <em>Tsukuyomi: the Divine Hunter</em> which featured an AI trained on my art where players could create unique cards by playing the game. Through the AI, it felt as if I could connect with everyone around the world and wondered if we could use these cards to create something new.
