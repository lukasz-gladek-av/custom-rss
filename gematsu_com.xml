      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shareholders are considering how to structure a possible buyout, two people familiar with the matter told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. <span id="more-931905"></span></p><p>The Guillemot family, which is the largest and founding shareholder of Ubisoft, has reportedly been in talks with <a title="Companies > Tencent [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, which owns a 10 percent stake in the company, and other shareholders in recent weeks about funding a <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>-led buyout.</p><p>The people said that the Guillemot family would like to retain control over the company, but Tencent has not decided whether it will participate in a buyout and increase its stake in the company. Tencent is said to have asked for a greater say on future board decisions in return, which the Guillemot family has not agreed to.</p><p>Discussions are reportedly ongoing as Tencent would like to prevent a hostile takeover of Ubisoft by other investors. One person said Tencent’s plan is to remain patient and wait for the Guillemot family to agree to a deal.</p><p>Both Tencent and the Guillemot family declined to comment, but a representative for Ubisoft said, “We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>PlayStation 5 Pro ray-tracing support, new playable Agents, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “A Storm of Falling Stars,” will launch on December 18, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-931725"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As falling stars pierce the night sky, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>‘s upcoming Version 1.4 will introduce an overhaul of Main Story stages, significant updates to Hollow Zero, the game’s debut on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Pro, and the highly anticipated Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa.</p><p>In this upcoming version, the TV mode in the Main Story will be replaced with more immersive combat and exploration. The highly anticipated Section 6 Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa, are coming soon, unveiling the culminating chapter of the year. The update will also introduce a major new combat gameplay mode, Hollow Zero: Shadows Lost, alongside the addition of new areas, Port Elpis and <a title="Games > Reverb" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reverb">Reverb</a> Arena. Proxies can obtain the S-Rank character Asaba Harumasa for free after the update.</p><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>‘s Version 1.4 features various optimizations to make combat and gameplay smoother than ever. Redesigned Main Story stages from the Prologue to Chapter 3 are now added to the HDD system. In future updates to the Main Story, the TV mode will also be replaced with story stages, allowing Proxies to dive directly into battles while commanding Eous to explore the Hollows. Additionally, all contracted Agents will be playable in the city, and a new Quality Time Mode lets Proxies stroll through New Eridu with their Agents. In combat, Decibels will no longer be shared across the squad, allowing all squad members to unleash their stunning Ultimates in a row for even more spectacular battle scenes. The update also adds a Quick Sweep feature for Shiyu Defense challenges, along with other optimizations to streamline progression and character upgrades.</p><p>In previous chapters, Proxies were drawn into a conspiracy surrounding Sacrifice after the demolition case orchestrated by Vision Corporation. In Chapter 5, with the awakening of our “old friend” Perlman, the hidden truths and the Wise and Belle’s backstories will be revealed. Meanwhile, New Eridu Public Security is undergoing a leadership election. As the truth comes to light and a new crisis emerges, Proxies will join forces with Section 6 to venture into the unknown Port Elpis, where all mysteries will be unveiled as the story reaches its finale.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_931726"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Two renowned members of Section 6 will be unlocked simultaneously along with the S-Rank Bangboo Agent Gulliver. Facing formidable enemies, Hoshimi Miyabi, the youngest Void Hunter, showcases her unmatched strength with her Ethereal-Slaying Katana – Tailless. As a Frost <a title="Games > Anomaly Agent [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/anomaly-agent">Anomaly Agent</a>, Miyabi can surround enemies with Icefire, causing Frost Anomaly and triggering special effects. With swift movements and precise slashes, she accumulates Fallen Frost to unleash a powerful forward attack, dealing devastating Frost damage before elegantly sheathing her blade. Beyond appreciating Miyabi’s graceful sword skill, Proxies can also uncover Harumasa’s hidden past in his special OVA. As an Electric Agent, Harumasa seamlessly switches between bow and blade, marks targets, and delivers unexpected strikes to enemies with active Electro Quivers. Proxies who reach Inter-Knot Lv. 8 can obtain Asaba Harumasa for free after Version 1.4 goes live.</p><p>Moreover, new combat gameplay modes are coming in Version 1.4, including Hollow Zero’s major update, Shadows Lost, and a new periodic operation, Deadly Assault. Proxies will face intense battles in the Lost Void with enhanced support and new equipment, such as Gear, Bangboo Assist skills, and Resonia. Additionally, the newly unlocked Reverb Arena will host a range of events to showcase its vibrant atmosphere, including a Bangboo-themed <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense game</a>play.</p><p>Apart from the release of Version 1.4 on PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,853 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, iOS, and Android, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> will officially launch on PlayStation 5 Pro on December 18, featuring enhanced performance and ray-tracing technology for an upgraded visual experience.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for PlayStation 5 via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, PC via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.4 trailer and special program below.
