We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p><p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, September 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact [Nintendo].
