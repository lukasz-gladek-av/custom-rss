      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > poncle [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/poncle">poncle</a>, in cooperation with <a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,341 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, has announced <em><a title="Games > Vampire Survivors [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a></em> downloadable content “Emerald Diorama,” a collaboration with <em><a title="Games > SaGa Emerald Beyond [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond">SaGa Emerald Beyond</a></em>. It is available now for all platforms, free of charge. <span id="more-957436"></span></p><p>“We have another big surprise for <em>SaGa</em> fans: a collaboration between <em>Vampire Survivors</em> (yes, that <em>Vampire Survivors</em>!) and <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>,” said <em>SaGa</em> series general director Akitoshi Kawazu in a press release. “You may be wondering what could have possibly brought a bullet hell, <a title="Genres > Survival [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelike [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> and <em>SaGa</em> together. This collaboration was realized thanks to Luca from poncle being a fan of the <em>SaGa</em> franchise. I would never have imagined that SaGa would continue to expand in this way, so at the same time as being totally surprised, I feel a new, fresh kind of joy.”</p><p>Kawazu continued, “To the <em>SaGa</em> fans out there who haven’t experienced <em>Vampire Survivors</em> yet: please seize this opportunity to jump in and enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. And I would love for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> fans to try playing <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em> as well. But first, let’s enjoy <em>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em>. I’m going to be playing too—until my fingers hurt!”</p><p><em>SaGa</em> series producer <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>anori Ichikawa added, “Firstly, I’m truly delighted that this day has arrived. Thank you so much to Luca and all the creators at poncle for your love of <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>. I’ll also be diving in and enjoying this collaboration!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3451100/Vampire_Survivors_Emerald_Diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In a universe where a single level up choice can change everything, the <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> characters stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vampire Survivors, united to face their next <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,193 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> together. Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire? We doubt it, but never say never.</p><p>As the Junction opens, the Vampire Survivors are thrust into a strange system of interconnected worlds, from a wondrous enchanted witchdom to a sinister realm of bloody nightmares. Equipped with the power of Glimmers and befriended by those that understand this strange universe better than anyone, onward they step in to the unknown; united in cause, wanting to survive, and bereft of fear. Well maybe a little bit of fear.</p><p><strong>Over 12 New Characters</strong></p><p>An eclectic cast of bizarre <em>SaGa</em> protagonists join the Survivors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido</strong> – A fate-forged master of Kugutsu combat puppets.</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling</strong> – An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie and Formina</strong> – A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms.</li><li><strong>Diva No. 5</strong> – A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds (and robotic bodies) to rediscover her memories.</li><li><strong>And Many More!</strong> – Including a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies…</li></ul><p><strong>Over 16 New Weapons and the Glimmer Mechanic</strong></p><p>40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the <em>SaGa</em> series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there’s a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of<em> SaGa</em> gets represented!</p><ul><li><strong>Fleuret</strong> – Stab enough encroaching enemies and you’ll Glimmer the Crystalline Carve, letting you freeze foes whilst cutting them down.</li><li><strong>Pressure Point</strong> – Unleash a barrage of martial arts blows at close range to Glimmer the far-reaching fire jab Shenlong Firefist.</li><li><strong>Hecaton Machine Gun</strong> – Shoot a blistering salvo of interestingly inaccurate bullets to Glimmer the Bombarding Fire technique, blasting baddies with a massive upheaval of the earth.</li><li><strong>Hyperion Bazooka</strong> – Master these high-power missiles that explode as they penetrate through hordes of foes to Glimmer the Cosmic Rave to massively multiply your firepower.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Parties</strong></p><p>No <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,598 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> downloadable content is complete without a squad of odd allies to pal around with. Level up Tsunanori Mido to summon up to four Kugutsu combat puppets, fighting independently with their own weapons in a defensive cross formation. Pick either Bonnie or Formina to play as both intrepid investigators, combining punches and pistols for a powerful partnership. And in the darkness of Yomi, rumours swirl of a Dismal King who can enthral defeated foes to make his own army of allies…</p><p><strong>Showstopper</strong></p><p>Survivors never give up! When a <em>SaGa</em> character reaches critical HP they fight back from the brink with a Showstopper, a brief burst of bonus Might, decreased Cooldown, and a little extra Luck to help them survive whatever precarious situation you’ve put them in with a tempest of powered-up projectiles.</p><p><strong>A New World-Weaving Stage</strong></p><p>Follow the Emerald Wave through a diorama of interwoven worlds, the perfect setting to walk sideways while mowing down masses of unusual monsters and bonkers bosses.</p><p><strong>Remixes of Stupendous <em>SaGa: Emerald Beyond</em> Tracks</strong></p><ul><li>“A Fierce Engagement”</li><li>“A Quick Warm-Up”</li><li>“Against All Odds”</li><li>“CCPD, Moving Out!”</li><li>“Darkness Incarnate”</li><li>“Emerald Destinies”</li><li>“Feel The Beat”</li><li>“The World’s Heartbeat”</li><li>“Yumeha, Chipper As Ever!”</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,223 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,008 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,888 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,902 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,923 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,830 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/?snr=1_5_9__205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, iOS, and Android.</p><p>Watch the downloadable content announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>DLC “Emerald Diorama” Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama | Launch Trailer | OUT NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrb7lTnklrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
