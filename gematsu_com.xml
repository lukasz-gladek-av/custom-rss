Combine unique districts into a vibrant living city and help restore our <em>River Towns</em>.</p><p><strong>Puzzle a River Town</strong></p><p>Each of the three districts has its own set of shapes which are shuffled randomly. This makes every game you play a new and unique puzzle to solve. The different district’s unique and vibrant architecture combines into beautiful little towns along the river. As the town grows, more townspeople move in and bring life back into this old and broken world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Earn Points</strong></p><p>Buildings also belong to differently colored districts which score bonus points when connected into large clusters. Getting a good score on each level awards stars, which restores the world and also unlocks more levels.</p><p><strong>Each Level is Different</strong></p><p>The beginning of each town starts with you restoring this part of the dried up river and surrounding it with buildings. Throughout the game you encounter other objectives, such as gold to collect, trees to regrow and old monuments to rebuild. This turns the difficulty and possibility of collecting points completely upside down.</p><p><strong>Progression</strong></p><p>With every city you piece together, the world becomes a little more verdant. When you complete a level, you will receive a gold, silver or bronze marker, depending on your score. Once you have enough points, you can move on to the next world.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Piece together beautiful towns along the river.</li><li>Earn points in various ways.</li><li>Enjoy many unique levels with ever-changing mechanics.</li><li>Restore nature and rebuild the monuments of the old, broken world.</li><li>Share your towns with photo mode.</li><li>Compare your score with your friends.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
