Players act as the Ratatan, using magical instruments to deliver different commands to the armies of Cobun to attack the enemies.</p><p>In addition to attack and defence rhythmic sequences, there are also actions that allow the Ratatan to move freely, with unique skills for each character, further deepening the musicality of the game. Players will enter “fever mode” when they accurately follow the rhythm sequences. In fever mode, the background music changes interactively, and characters perform various actions. </p><!-- AD: content -->

It has also added a lot of new content, including a brand new system and mini games for multiplayers.
