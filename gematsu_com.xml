To be able to bring this game back to life for the modern gamer, to expand the base of those who enjoy playing it, and to have those two audiences play together is a privilege and a pleasure for all of us. We’re excited to bring this to continually new audiences.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Relive the game that started it all! The original Backyard Baseball ’97, now enhanced to run on Steam. Whether you’re picking your dream team, hitting home runs, or just here for the witty banter, step back into the backyard and experience the game that made baseball fun for everyone!</p><p>Play pick-up games, practice batting, keep track of stats, compete in single games or a whole season – you can even set the rules! Backyard Baseball ‘97 features all of the realism and statistics of adult baseball games but with simple, intuitive controls that anyone can master.</p><p><strong>Batter Up, Playground Style</strong></p><p>The rules for Backyard Baseball are a hybrid of Major and Little League rules:</p><ul><li>No leading off</li><li>No Injuries</li><li>Bunting is allowed</li><li>Tagging up is allowed</li><li>You can also practice batting</li></ul><p>To get into the swing of things, choose a batter and face Mr. Clanky for some batting practice. This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li><li><strong>Single Game</strong> – You take turns with the computer, choosing players from a random pool of characters.</li><li><strong>Season</strong> – You create a team and manage the team through a 14 game series. The opposing teams are computer generated. At the end of the season the best two teams advance to the BBL playoffs (best of three). The playoffs winner advances to the championship series which consists of the Super Entire Nation Tournament (best of three) and then the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe Series (best of five)!</li></ul><p><strong>Global Leaderboard</strong></p><p>Compete globally! Steam’s Leaderboard system lets you compete with friends and players around the world. Track your home runs, strike-outs, grand slams, season wins and more in real-time. See how you stack up and strive to reach the top!</p><p>At our core, we are fans first–not just of video games but of the <a title="Games > Backyard Sports [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/backyard-sports">Backyard Sports</a> franchise. Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.</p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Baseball '97 - Available Now on PS5!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I31HyDN4eB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span><a title="Platforms > Switch [17,221 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Backyard Baseball '97 - Available Now on Nintendo Switch!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNm-xIPa_Es?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Running With Scissors let us butcher it and stitch it back to life—now with fewer surprise blue screens. Kickstarter is simply how we shove even more nonsense in before some suit makes us stop.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Flat2VR Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> is a ground‑up overhaul of 2003’s infamous open‑world <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>. Part modernization, part love‑letter, <em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> will hoist every original asset out of the creaking Unreal 1.5 engine and slam it into today’s Unity—delivering the same familiar week in the POSTAL Dude’s life with a merciless glow‑up and a bucket of new toys.</p><p><em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> was born the moment developer Team Beef’s mad doctors cracked the original <em>POSTAL 2</em> open for <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> (<em><a title="Games > POSTAL 2: VR [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/postal-2-vr">POSTAL 2: VR</a></em>) and saw two decades of code begging for a modern makeover. Rather than compromise the Dude’s glorious return with a quick and dirty spit-shine, publisher Flat2VR Studios convinced Running With Scissors to authorize a full resurrection: preserve every scat‑splattered inch of Paradise, but rebuild the guts so the game actually boots on hardware manufactured this decade—without the aroma of burnt silicon.</p><p>The goal is simple: deliver the ultimate, no‑excuses <em>POSTAL 2</em> sandbox—rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel. <em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> will pack in enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‑up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High-Resolution Textures and Dynamic Lighting</strong> – Paradise’s warped billboards and puddles of questionable fluid finally get the razor‑sharp grime they deserve.</li><li><strong>Zero‑Load Streaming World</strong> – Sprint from one end of town to the other without a single elevator, door pause, or immersion‑breaker.</li><li><strong>Smarter, Freer Crowds</strong> – Civilians still snitch, cops still overreact, but improved path‑finding means riots spark faster and messier than ever.</li><li><strong>Re‑Forged Arsenal</strong> – Weighty ballistics, rag‑doll dismemberment, and rounds that punch clean through unlucky bystanders.</li><li><strong>Fully Propped, Breakable Interiors</strong> – Stores, <a title="Platforms > Arcade [378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a>, and alleyways are stuffed with physics‑enabled junk begging to be destroyed.</li><li><strong>Champ 2.0</strong> – Pet him, sic him, or let him photobomb your next headshot; Paradise’s goodest boy finally earns his kibble.</li></ul><p>Paradise itself will breathe: lighting shifts over the course of each in-game day—from sun-scorched afternoons to lamp-lit alleys come evening—and every junk-strewn corner bristles with physics-enabled debris begging to be destroyed. Every classic instrument of overkill is being rebuilt from the trigger up—plus a few fresh calibers Paradise PD hasn’t outlawed yet. Word on the street is the Dude’s… attachments might be in line for an upgrade too—because tasteful restraint is for other franchises.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="POSTAL 2 Redux - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxoIseTSPOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
