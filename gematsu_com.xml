        <p><em>Ninja Issen</em> tells the story of Kiba, the top ninja in his clan who was framed for the murder of his clan leader. His clan immediately labels him a traitor assassin, sentencing him to be killed and bringing him to death’s door during their pursuit. However, with help from his new friend, Kiba is reborn as a powerful hyper ninja, embarking on a journey for revenge in order to set things right and clear his name.</p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p><p>One day, Kiba, the top ninja of his clan, is falsely accused of murdering his clan leader and is immediately chased off by pursuers before he’s able to clear his name.</p><p>Though Kiba’s status as top ninja is well known among his clan members, there are simply too many pursuers to stand up to. Though he’s desperate to take revenge on those pursuing him, he suddenly finds himself in a world unknown to him.</p><p>Kiba just manages to save his skin, but the fierce fight has left him on death’s doorstep. Yet, through some strange coincidence, engineer Hanzo happens upon the struggling Kiba and pulls him back from the brink of death.</p><p>Through a series of modifications and reinforcements, Kiba gains even more strength. Now, he’s on a journey of revenge, looking to clear his name and return to his own world…</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kiba</strong> – Our skilled ninja protagonist. Falsely accused of killing his clan leader one day, he finds himself being pursued. For some reason unknown to him, he was brought into the heart of a city in the future in critical condition.
