      </p></div><div><p><em>Tangle Tower</em> successor <em>The Mermaid <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>k</em>, formerly <em><a title="Games > The Mermaid Mask [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-mermaid-mask">The Mermaid’s Tongue</a></em>, will launch for unspecified consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,466 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/" target="_blank">Steam</a> this summer, developer <a title="Companies > SFB Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sfb-games">SFB Games</a> announced. A new demo is available now. <span id="more-1025489"></span></p><p>“We’ve been working on <em>The Mermaid Mask</em> for a long time—never before have we poured so much love and care into a single project, and it’s become something quite remarkable,” said creative director Adam Vian in a press release. “In 2024, our <a title="Genres > Survival [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [816 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Crow Country [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a></em> became a surprise hit, which diverted our attention a little longer than we’d initially intended (a good problem to have, as <em>Crow Country</em> was wonderfully well received).”</p><p>Vian continued, “We can’t wait to finally share <em>The Mermaid Mask</em> with players this year. There really is so much to discover in this game. It’s a great self-contained murder mystery for new players—while at the same time, for those people who are familiar with the series, particularly 2019’s <em>Tangle Tower</em>… you’re really not going to want to miss this.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via SFB Games:</p><blockquote><p>A riotous follow-up to the beloved <em>Tangle Tower</em>, one of Apple <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">Arcade</a>‘s top three most highly rated games of all time. It is the latest instalment of SFB Games’ much-loved <em>Detective Grimoire</em> series, which began as a flash game on Newgrounds in 2007. <em>The Mermaid Mask</em> is a witty, visually spectacular detective mystery that balances heavy themes with light-hearted humour.</p><p>Submerge yourself in the nautical beauty of the sprawling Mortuga Submarine, unlocking its many oddities and secrets. In the pitch-black waters beyond a long-abandoned fishing town, the enigmatic captain of the world’s strangest submarine has been murdered. Some say he was an immortal time-traveller. Others say he was a vampire, cursed to stay hidden beneath the waves forever. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Interrogate the sub’s suspicious occupants – each lovingly voice-acted and brought to life through expressive, hand-drawn 2D animation – and collect clues by solving satisfying puzzles designed to encourage curiosity, experimentation, and that ultimate “aha!” moment of discovery.</p><p>This new entry to the series sees the return of renowned voice actors, Edwyn Tiong (<em><a title="Games > Loco Motive [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/loco-motive">Loco Motive</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Harold Halibut [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/harold-halibut">Harold Halibut</a></em>, <em>Unavowed</em>) and <a title="Companies > Amber" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amber">Amber</a> Lee Connors (<em>Jujustsu Kaizen</em>, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>, <em>DAN DA DAN</em>, <em><a title="Games > The Outer Worlds 2 [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a></em>), to their roles as the endearing Detective Grimoire and his sardonic sidekick, Sally. Supported by an incredible cast of voice talent from gaming, anime, film, and radio—to be revealed soon.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/the-mermaid-mask-launches-this-summer]]></content:encoded>
