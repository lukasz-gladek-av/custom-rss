            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Memories of Dreams Bygone,” will launch on October 15, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [207 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-997143"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this latest update, players will team up with Spook Shack and set foot in the newly unlocked Timesworn Hills, where ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins in the Hollow. Lucia, Yidhari, and Komano Manato join the battlefield as new Agents, accompanied by fresh gameplay, new outfits for Vivian and Manato, and engaging events.</p><p>The newly revealed Timesworn Hills region, known for its abundant Lumite ore deposits, conceals abandoned research facilities and testing ground ruins where chilling legends thrive. Tales of miners who vanished within the Miasma, the tolling of a phantom bell, creatures that gaze into people’s hearts, and hypnotists capable of ensnaring victims in endless dreams haunt the land. This new adventure begins with the case of missing miners and Porcelumex employees, drawing Proxies into the Hollow to uncover unsettling truths.</p><p>The new members from Spook Shack bring not only fascination with haunted tales but also formidable strength to the battlefield. Lucia, an S-Rank Ether Support Agent and devoted Ethereal fan, wields dreamlike powers to recreate Ethereals in combat. By accumulating Dream Points, she can enter a Dream state and unleash Ether Veil: Wellspring, boosting all allies’ max HP while enhancing team damage through increased Sheer Force and triggering Aftershocks. Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent, embodies both risk and resilience. She gains Sheer Force based on her max HP, and her ice attacks always inflict Sheer DMG, piercing through enemy defenses. Her damage increases as her HP percentage drops, rewarding a delicate balance of HP loss and recovery. Meanwhile, Komano Manato, now joining the battlefield as an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent, unleashes Sheer DMG with strikes that scale from his max HP. In addition, S-level agents Vivian (Ether – Anomaly) and Ju Fufu (Fire – Stun) will return in this version’s banners.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_997145"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> continuously gears up to deliver eventful content and optimized combat experiences. In Version 2.3, Soldier 0 – Anby will be enhanced through refined combat mechanics and boosted performance to unleash her latent combat potential. New gameplay “Threshold <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a>” offers both tactical and combat challenges as Proxies deploy multiple squads to withstand interconnected battle scenarios. The event “When Dreams Remain Unfinished” introduces turn-based combat, where players command various categories of monsters with unique traits and tactical positioning. Completing the event also grants Agent <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>to as a free reward. Additionally, the beloved “SNAP! Shining Strike” photography event returns with an upgrade, offering more freedom with camera controls, diverse filters and frames, allowing players to capture stunning scenes.</p><p>As New Eridu’s story continues to unfold, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> offers a heartfelt glimpse of what lies ahead. Future agents — including Banyue, Dialyn, Zhao, and Ye Shunguang — are set to join the Proxies’ journey in the near future. As a token of gratitude for embarking on the adventures still to come, Proxies can claim an extra 600 Polychromes in addition to the regular rewards of 10 Encrypted Master Tapes and 10 Boopons during Version 2.3.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,420 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.
