A full release is planned across both console and PC. <span id="more-926304"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Various Aspects of Life!</strong></p><p><em>inZOI</em> is a life simulation game where the player can alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences. Just like in the real world, you can find jobs to make a living while forming deep relationships through interactions. With a complete community simulation of every character acting on their free will, you can experience unexpected events to feel the various emotions life has to offer. With <em>inZOI</em>, we hope to share the message that “life itself is the true gift, and every journey has its own meaning.”</p><p><strong>Live the Life of Your Dreams!</strong></p><p><em>inZOI</em> provides a variety of creative tools, so that players can visualize the life they’ve always dreamed of. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game’s realistic graphics allows the players to let their imagination run free, with easy creation of different resources. Customize your character’s appearance and outfit and build your custom home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures. You can also adjust different parts of your property and surrounding roads as well as aspects of your residing city for a fully customizable experience.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here is a message from producer and director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim posted to the game’s official Discord server today:</p><blockquote><p>To <em>inZOI</em> fans around the world,</p><p>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our fans. Your immense love and unwavering support mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom. Seeing everyone create such unique Zois during our <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> demo period was truly inspiring.</p><p>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing “Canvas” to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an incredible amount of uploads. Seeing such engagement brought us so much happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with <em>inZOI</em>. Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</p><p>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release <em>inZOI</em> in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving <em>inZOI</em> the best possible start.</p><p>It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with <em>inZOI</em>—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving <em>inZOI</em> a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible.</p><p>Until the release date, we’ll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come. We’ll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you’ll continue to join us on this journey towards <em>inZOI</em>‘s Early Access and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>With love,<br>Kjun</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/inZOI-EA_11-07-24_Art.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
