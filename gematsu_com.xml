      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Game Source Entertainment [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/game-source-entertainment">Game Source Entertainment</a> and developers <a title="Companies > TVT [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tvt">TVT</a> and <a title="Companies > Ratata Arts [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ratata-arts">Ratata Arts</a> will release the “Descent of the Dark <a title="Games > Ratatan [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ratatan">Ratatan</a>” update for <em>Ratatan</em> on December 25, the companies announced. The update introduces a new story arc and events centered around the Dark Ratatan. <span id="more-1015682"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update’s content, via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2949320/view/539998908081766456" target="_blank">Ratata Arts</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Descent of the Dark Ratatan</strong></p><p>In this update, we’ll be introducing new events and new battles related to the Dark Ratatan. As mentioned previously, one of the major issues with the <a title="Genres > Roguelite [319 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite</a> structure has been its over-reliance on battles, so we’re refining the experience to better balance battles and event-driven progression.</p><p><strong>Event Section: Episode 2 Unlock</strong></p><p>After clearing World 5, new story content will unfold as Episode 2. The events are designed so players can gradually experience the lead-up to challenges such as Goddess Games and Formidable Foes.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Furthermore, the Dark Ratatan events are not just additional boss encounters—they play a central role in storytelling and touch on the core of <em>Ratatan</em>‘s narrative. They also function as roguelite events, evolving the structure so that story and gameplay become more closely integrated.</p><p>Regarding the new stage tricks and gimmicks shown previously on the roadmap: For the December update, we decided to integrate these elements into the Dark Ratatan event side, in order to focus the design and development resources on delivering a cohesive experience.</p><p><strong>Battle Section: Dark Ratatan Fights</strong></p><p>The Dark Ratatan battles follow a structure unlike any previous boss fights in the game. In addition to their own attacks, they command Dark Cobun through musical cues, mirroring Ratatan’s own command style.</p><p>The difficulty ranks among the highest in the entire game, and defeating them will reward players with powerful Mythic-tier gear. Not all Dark Ratatans will appear in this update; they will be added gradually in future patches.</p><p>A major highlight of these battles is the new original track composed specifically for the Dark Ratatan, forming the core of the battle presentation. We hope you enjoy this fresh musical experience.</p><p><strong>New Ratakaruta Feature: Duo</strong></p><p>A new system, Duo, is coming to Ratakaruta. By raising the elemental forces of two or more attributes beyond a certain threshold, you’ll gain access to powerful Duo Ratakaruta.</p><p>This expands deck-building possibilities in two directions:</p><ul><li>Continued support for single-element builds.</li><li>New incentives for multi-element, hybrid builds.</li></ul><p>Because Duo cards are extremely powerful, the December update will limit acquisition to one per run. We will continue monitoring balance and may adjust this limit in the future.</p><p><strong>New Function: Goddess <a title="Genres > Gacha" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/gacha">Gacha</a></strong></p><p>The Goddess Gacha allows players to convert unwanted equipment, accessories, and materials into points, which can then be used for gacha pulls. Some exclusive items will appear only here, but the feature is intended as a light-hearted way to recycle surplus items.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Adjustments</strong></p><p>We’re updating the online random match lobby to improve usability. New features include:</p><ul><li>Ability to enter any available room.</li><li>A refresh button for lobby listings.</li></ul><p><strong>New Legendary Accessories</strong></p><p>We are adding a new accessory rarity: Legendary. These accessories include random Decorune effects, further enhancing strategic depth in build crafting.</p></blockquote><p><em>Ratatan</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,131 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>“Descent of the Dark Ratatan” Update Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Descent of the Dark Ratatan - ダークラタタン襲来 -" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSjuXYIrbhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/ratatan-early-access-update-descent-of-the-dark-ratatan-launches-december-25]]></content:encoded>
