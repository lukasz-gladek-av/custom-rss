When I first heard about the game, I was absolutely thrilled, and now that it has become a reality, I couldn’t be happier. I was especially surprised to learn that the game is being developed in the Netherlands! It felt amazing to say ‘Tenkamuteki no Daishōri!!’ (‘Unrivaled, ultimate victory!!’) again. I love Yattarou so much!”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichiro Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Hearing Kon-chan (Ko’on-no-Kami) and Gen-chan (Gennarisai) banter, Kenyū-san’s witty narration, and the Nyankī squad’s signature introductions—it was like stepping back into the recording studio from all those years ago. I was also blown away by how faithfully the trailer recreated the original animation style. The love and dedication from the Dutch development team truly shine through. And of course, a big thank you to Seiichiro Yamashita for bringing Sukashii to life!”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Congratulations on 35 years of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>!

And what are your thoughts on Seiichirō Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even after 35 years, this series remains as vibrant as ever in my heart. The moment I stepped into the studio with Kappei-san and the rest of the team, Pururun’s lines just came naturally. Seiichirō Yamashita did a fantastic job as Sukashii—he really captured the character’s essence.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as Samurai Pizza Cats?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even our post-recording gatherings (laughs) were a blast!

What was your experience recording for the trailer?</strong></p><p><strong>Seiichiro Yamashita:</strong> “To be honest, I wasn’t familiar with Kyatto Ninden Teyandee before this project. It’s incredible to be involved with a series that predates my birth. The recording session was truly special—I had the privilege of performing alongside legends like Kappei Yamaguchi, watching them work up close in such a dynamic setting.”</p><p><strong>How did you feel about taking over the role of Sukashii from your senior colleague Jurota Kosugi?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Even now, I feel like it’s too great an honor to say I’ve ‘inherited’ the role. This is my first time stepping into a character previously portrayed by another actor, and I was deeply conscious of preserving the image of Sukashii that fans hold dear. The encouragement from the production team was invaluable, and this has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Stories have a way of leaving lasting impressions on people, and the love for <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> has endured over decades.
