The way light passes through his hair changes depending on how the strands of hair are overlapped as well. This detailed expression of texture is one of the many details that we would especially love for our fans to see.”</p><p>Ijuin continued, “The upgraded [PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution] has allowed us to elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy. We hope you will experience this unprecedented level of horror and visual fidelity, and the new gameplay feel it delivers.”</p><p>Here is a comparison of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> featuring original PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaling, against the new more advanced version:</p><!-- AD: content -->

With the updated [PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution], we’re delivering the very latest of this co-developed technology with a further six months of refinement for [PlayStation 5] Pro players.”</p><p>More information will be shared in March, when multiple existing games are upgraded to the improved PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. A system software update will allow users to select “<a title="Companies > Enhance [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a> PSSR Image Quality” in setting to experience the more advanced upscaling with any games that currently support it.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PSSR-Upgrade_02-27-26_003.jpg"></a></figure></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-starting-with-resident-evil-requiem]]></content:encoded>
