From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future—one built in partnership with our players.”</p><p><em>skate.</em> head of creative Jeff Seamster added, “Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of <em>skate.</em> From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community—listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in, <em>skate.</em> is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers—just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</p><div id="carousel_988096"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Electronic Arts:</p><blockquote><p>Set in the vibrant city of San Vansterdam, <em>skate.</em> is a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [582 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> skateboarding destination offering a massive open world where players discover unique skate spots, land insane tricks and connect—or compete—with friends online.

With unparalleled precision and control, Flick-It brings the magic of the franchise back to life for a new generation of players. <em>skate.</em> also introduces a variety of new tricks—such as wallies, slappies and firecrackers—offering fresh ways to ride. Skatepedia serves as the ultimate resource for mastering tricks and styles, while ensuring accessibility for new players. </p><p>In <em>skate.</em>, players can discover new ways to explore and get vertical with new off-board controls, giving them total freedom to roam, climb and find epic new spots.
