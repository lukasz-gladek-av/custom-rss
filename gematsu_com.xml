Through repeated interaction, the story may develop in a way that you form a relationship with these women. The protagonist’s encounters with these women will surely brighten up his journey through Mie Prefecture.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong><a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>ne Shikama</strong> (voiced by Yuri Fujimoto)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_009.png"></a></figure><p>A writer for another magazine and MieCom participant who met the protagonist at the competition’s orientation. She is an earnest and kind woman who greets and encourages the nervous protagonist.</p><p>For the competition, she has decided to write an article about history (specifically the Sengoku period warlord Kuki Yoshitaka), and is going around locations connected to Kuki Yoshitaka to gather information.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Yuzuki Sonohara</strong> (voiced by Chisato Mori)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_014.png"></a></figure><p>A cheerful and outgoing woman. While she can easily jump to conclusions and intimidates the protagonist when they first meet, after assuming he is a flirt, her natural charm and friendliness make her strangely difficult to dislike.</p><p>Her hobby is photography, and she mainly goes around looking for breathtaking views and hidden gems to capture Mie Prefecture’s beautiful scenery.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Aika Tabuchi</strong> (voiced by Ayaka Fujimoto)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fuuraiki-5_2025_04-28-25_019.png"></a></figure><p>A woman with a calm vibe.
