Build a fully customizable and upgradeable skyship that serves as both your home base and your battleship against the colossal sky creatures known as the Seraph. Brave the dizzying heights with a physics-based grappling hook, wingsuits, and gliders, and enjoy the freedom to explore the endless possibilities that await.</p><p>In 2017, Bossa Games launched the ambitious sandbox MMO world of <em>Worlds Adrift</em> into Early Access. While the game ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release, the passion for the project and the world they created was never diminished or forgotten. When the time was right, Bossa decided to rebuild upon the strong groundwork left behind in <em>Worlds Adrift</em>‘s wake. <em>Lost Skies</em> is that spiritual successor in every way.</p><p>Lead Game Designer Luke Williams had this to say about the process of bringing <em>Lost Skies</em> to life: “<em>Lost Skies</em> was such a unique opportunity for a designer—if you could go back and revisit themes and experiences, what would you do? So we really wanted to elevate the elements players loved from <em>Worlds Adrift</em>, such as exploring hundreds of floating islands and building an entirely unique skyship from all the rare materials and parts you come across on your journey. Also some huge sky filling bosses thrown in for good measure. We’ve spent the last three years working with our community to make sure we’ve built an experience players can enjoy for years to come.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The small but mighty team at Bossa Games, creators of physics-fueled hits like <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> and <em>I Am Fish</em>, has worked tirelessly on making <em>Lost Skies</em> the best possible experience for past <em>Worlds Adrift</em> players and new players alike. Drawing on their past successes, they’ve built <em>Lost Skies</em> into a playground of fun and inventive mechanics, including the grapple hook which is so good that it’s been called the best grappling system by players and feels as smooth and rewarding as you’d expect from a AAA title.</p><p>Here are some of the team’s big updates and accomplishments for <em>Lost Skies</em> prior to the 1.0 release:</p><ul><li><strong>Get Creative</strong> – The introduction of the Island Creator prior to launch allowed players to craft their own islands, share them with the community, and get ready to fly when Early Access arrived. Dozens of these hand-crafted islands populate the world players explore on a daily basis. Players can also unleash their creativity by designing skyships however they choose, <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the perfect home base among the clouds!</li><li><strong>Play Your Way</strong> – Full keybinding was added to allow players to customize their keys in order to climb, grapple, glide, and fight with whatever keys best suit them.</li><li><strong>Content, Content, Content</strong> – New weapons, ship assets, naval boss battles, regions, puzzles, a map table, storage naming, better inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and so much more has been added during the Early Access period and is ready for all players to enjoy in the 1.0 launch.</li><li><strong>Improvements Galore</strong> – From day one, the team worked to remove bugs, deliver quality of life updates, and ensure the utmost stability for 1.0 while players journeyed through the clouds.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Version 1.0 Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Lost Skies | 1.0 Launch Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCawAfVtLHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/lost-skies-launches-september-17]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Load up alone or with a friend for two player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [321 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a>erative gameplay in this stylized pixel-painted love letter to the classic shooters of yesteryear.</p><p>Take on the role of Alex, who awakes on-board a Capital Battleship on the way to war – only to find that much of the crew is dead, and the ship is infested with monsters. Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.
