As the water goes down, the environment itself becomes both an obstacle and a chance for discovery. Players will have to adapt to these constant shifts, confront ancient threats, and uncover the secrets buried deep within Saiadha. Each cataclysm brings new dangers, but also unique opportunities.</p><p><strong> Forge Your Own Legend </strong></p><p>Step into a world where your choices matter. Players need to lead their hero on epic journeys to conquer new territories, earn valuable experience, and build deep relationships with allies and rivals alike. Select from a variety of factions, each with their own distinct philosophies, strengths, and playstyles, offering a unique gameplay experience. The diversity of these factions is reflected in their asymmetric gameplay, ensuring that no two paths are the same. Discover four unique factions when the game launches into Early Access, with two more to be added by full release.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
