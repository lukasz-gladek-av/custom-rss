Based on real Irish legends of the secret society known as the Hellfire Club, in Eyes of Hellfire you and your friends are trapped within the club’s headquarters, an abandoned hunting lodge. Enter the grounds of the Hellfire Club, cautiously explore, cooperate, evade the violent entities within the lodge, and discover what you can while you each attempt to lift your curse. Escape before your soul is lost. Be warned! In these walls something, or someone, is always lying.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Solve the Curse with Two-to-Five Players</strong> – You and your friends play as a small group of unfortunate people who have recently discovered that they have each become a victim of a potentially fatal curse. They have hiked through the thick woods of the Dublin mountains and travelled to the ruins of the Hellfire Club in the hopes of discovering what connects them to this place and what, or who, has brought this curse upon them all.</li><li><strong>Cooperate or Betray</strong> – You and your team have a common goal of escaping the haunted lodge while also defeating the Antagonist. But you each also have hidden solo objectives. Which will you prioritize? You must succeed at both to win. Use proximity voice chat to plot together with teammates, as well as question their motives.</li><li><strong>Character-Driven Dread</strong> – Choose from a variety of characters, with their own strengths, weaknesses, and goals. Your choice will impact what you see in each play session; you’ll have to decide if it’s real or not.</li><li><strong>Build Your Hand of <a title="Genres > Action [2,912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s</strong> – Build your hand of actions: Each playthrough you start with a hand of cards that equal actions that can be done each turn, limited by your action points. As you explore the lodge, you’ll discover new and better action cards to alter your playthrough.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Release Date Reveal | Eyes of Hellfire" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgSGbzQAD9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/eyes-of-hellfire-launches-in-early-access-on-august-27]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Strange Antiquities" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/strange-antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a></em>, the standalone sequel to <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 17, publisher <a title="Companies > Iceberg Interactive [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/iceberg-interactive">Iceberg Interactive</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Bad Viking" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bad-viking">Bad Viking</a> announced. <span id="more-983118"></span></p><p>“We have poured a lot of love into Strange Antiquities and we’re very proud of what we have made,” said creators John and Rob Donkins in a press release. “We’ve taken all the lessons we learned from <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and made something more ambitious, intricate, and with more depth to it. We wanted to make a game in which players feel like real investigators of the occult, poring over manuscripts and reference materials by candlelight while the rain beats down outside. We’ve made a game that trusts our players to piece things together for themselves—to delve into the details, to follow the breadcrumbs and to notice what matters. We’re excited for you to play it and discover this cabinet of curiosities for yourselves.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Become the custodian of a store dealing in occult antiquities. Explore the quaint and gloomy town of Undermere, where strange goings-on and dark mysteries abound. Find and identify arcane artefacts, use your collection to aid the townsfolk with their unusual problems — and remember to pet your cat!</p><p><strong>A Note From the Shopkeeper</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>I am pleased to offer you the role of Apprentice Thaumaturge at Strange Antiquities.</p><p>You show promise—a sharp mind and a strong stomach—exactly what this work demands. I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.</p><p>Undermere might seem unassuming at first—a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond—and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.</p><p>Permit me now to outline your duties—you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.</p><p><strong>On Your Duties in the Shop (Gameplay Mechanics)</strong></p><p>Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!</p><ul><li><strong>Study and Identify</strong> – Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.</li><li><strong>Help… Or Hinder</strong> – When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.</li><li><strong>Explore and Discover</strong> – From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumors or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.</li><li><strong>Solve and Uncover</strong> – Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.</li><li><strong>Tending the Familiar</strong> – And, of course, <a title="Companies > Jupiter Corporation [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/jupiter-corporation">Jupiter</a>, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.</li></ul><p><strong>About My Absence (Narrative and Setting)</strong></p><p>These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.</p><p>Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.</p><p>There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.</p><p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p><p>This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.</p><p>I look forward to your arrival.</p><p>Yours,<br>Eli White<br>Thaumaturge &amp; Proprietor<br>Strange Antiquities, Undermere<br>Purveyors of the Arcane Since 1683</p><p><strong>A Note from the Developers</strong></p><p>We are two brothers from the United Kingdom who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!</p><p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.</p><p>We want to thank everyone who has played <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can’t wait to share the next chapter with you.</p><p>Many thanks,<br>Rob and John</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/strange-antiquities-launches-september-17-for-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>
