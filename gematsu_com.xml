        <p>The legendary <em>Snow Bros.</em> series began over 30 years ago. <em>Snow Bros. Wonderland</em> is the newest chapter—and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren’t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich?</p><p><strong>Four Times the Fun</strong></p><p>Previously, <em>Snow Bros.</em> was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style!</p><p><strong>The History of <em>Snow Bros.</em></strong></p><p>The first game in the chilly, snowy <em>Snow Bros.</em> saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, <em>Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves</em>—a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining—was released. But despite the love for the first two <em>Snow Bros.</em> games, we haven’t had a true third entry in the series. Until now.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for? Let’s grab some friends and dive into the snowy fun!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [402 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Snow Bros.

        <p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> began life as a remaster of the original title before D-Pad Studio got carried away by their enthusiasm and ended up creating a full blown sequel to the original title. <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> takes the shoot ’em up <a title="Genres > Platformer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> to new heights, with a host of new content that more than doubles the size of the original game. Venture through five stages, each with their own unique gimmick, across which you’ll have to battle Laser Sharks, robotic space invaders and even an immortal Samurai. To beat these new stages and take down the bosses at the end of each, you’ll have a new double jump, cancel-jump and mid-air powershots to add to your arsenal. There’s also a new endless Survival Mode, new difficulties modes—including a <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,068 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System-style, no checkpoints Hardcore Mode— and 36 newly composed songs from acclaimed Norwegian musician Savant.</p><p>In <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em>, you play as the Alchemist, who’s been cast down from his tower by an unknown force. Your goal is to ascend back to the top, with your movement limited at all times to two platforms, be they moving elevators or space debris. By using rapid volleys of magic missiles to take out attacking enemies and precise dashes and jumps to move between the two platforms, you must try to survive the deadly journey back to the summit.</p><p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> is the ultimate way to experience a musical artist’s persona as you’ve never done before! The game is based on the universe of <em>Savant</em>—developed in collaboration with Simon S. Andersen of D-Pad Studio (<em>Owlboy</em> / <em><a title="Games > Vikings on Trampolines [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/vikings-on-trampolines">Vikings on Trampolines</a></em>).
