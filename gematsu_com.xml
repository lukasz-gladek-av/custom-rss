We wanted to create something different, a space where players can exhale. A space that values listening, empathizing, and slow, intentional conversations. With <em>Fireside Feelings</em>, we hope to inspire joy, catharsis, and connection through something as simple—and human—as sharing words beneath the stars.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via The CoLab:</p><blockquote><p>Following a philosophy that “we all need a good talk under the stars,” <em>Fireside Feelings</em> sees players sharing heartfelt and empathetic thoughts about diverse—and sometimes challenging—topics.</p><p>Players choose and customize their avatar from one of six different animals, including a besuited bear, a barista bee and a skater fox. Once selected, players begin their journey across meditative locales, including a beach, woodland and a record store.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>There they’ll meet Spark, a sentient campfire guiding them through a series of questions inspiring thoughtful and empathetic answers under the stars. Sat on the other side of the fire is a second animal, sharing another player’s previous answers to the same questions and forming a contemplative, yet asymmetrical, conversation on the chosen topic.</p><p>To provide a highly robust level of player safety, <em>Fireside Feelings</em> anonymizes answers and the player’s in-game character name. Responses given by the other player across the campfire are not live, but chosen from a moderated database of conversations.</p><p>Furthermore, sensitive topics that might be discussed and might be triggering for players—including violence, self-harm, mental illness and more—can be avoided by removing them from the discussion at the start of the game or via the main menu.</p><p>Team Empreintes and The CoLab have worked with Safe In Our World, the games industry’s mental health charity, to integrate a link to the Safe In Our World website from within the experience, where players can access resources and support.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Fireside Feelings Launch Trailer - Wholesome Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3j3JRzardU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In this program, you will meet Nini, the program’s official <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, who has a passion for nonogram puzzles. Nini has provided you with a cozy rat residence, but there’s just one condition: you must solve <em>Squeakross</em> puzzles to earn furniture and fill your empty home! Your puzzle catalog contains 650 solvable <em>Squeakross</em> puzzles. Each completed puzzle will reward you with furniture for your rodent residence. The hint numbers on the sides indicate how many squares to fill with cheese in each row or column. Mark the largest hint numbers, leaving spaces as needed. Then, analyze different arrangements to complete the puzzle. Strike out hint lines one by one and repeat the process until the picture of your brand-new furniture is revealed!</p><p><strong>Get Solving!</strong></p><p>If you haven’t solved a nonogram before, don’t worry! In <em>Squeakross</em>, anyone can quickly become a nonogram natural. Nini provides in-game guidance to help players learn how to solve nonograms step by step, and players can revisit the manual at any time for additional tutorials. Whether you are a whisker away from solving a puzzle or looking for a more relaxed experience, you can ask your furry friend for assistance in Logic Assist mode. This feature shows possible solutions to help complete puzzles with two options: An “automatic case-solving” button and a “show mistakes” button. For experienced nonogram players seeking a greater challenge, “Nini’s Challenge” offers a more difficult variant of each puzzle, unlocking colorways for furniture in your home. To ensure an inclusive experience, <em>Squeakross</em> also incorporates many gameplay options for players to tweak their own experience and overall difficulty of puzzles!</p><!-- AD: content -->
