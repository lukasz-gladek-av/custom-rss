            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Overview</strong></p><p>“Breakpoint” is the first major free content update for <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, Remedy Entertainment’s three-player cooperative <a title="Genres > Action [3,080 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> set in the Control universe. Launching September 29, this update is more than just new content—it’s a refresh of how the core game is played.</p><p>With the introduction of the Crisis Board, Gun Mods, the brand-new Outbreak Crisis, an overhauled economy, and improvements to onboarding, progression and balance, “Breakpoint” brings variety, depth, and a stronger “first responder” feel to <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p><p><strong>■ Key Additions</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>New Playable Crisis: Outbreak</strong></p><p>A brand-new mission set in the Research Sector, where Mold infestation creates unique challenges, enemies, and a dangerous new condition.</p><p><strong>Crisis Board</strong></p><p>The new Crisis Board replaces the old Job Board and presents curated Crises to play, making <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to its firstresponder fantasy.</p><p>At any given time, four-to-six Crises are active globally, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs, each with randomized rewards, objectives, and length. The Crisis Board refreshes every 30 minutes.</p><p>Crises in Zones 1-2 have streamlined requirements and can occasionally swap in unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. The Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to help other teams.</p><p><strong>Gun Mods</strong> (27 total)</p><p>Customize and empower your weapons with a new layer of progression. These mods let you shape your loadout to fit your team’s needs and playstyle.</p><p><strong>Expanded Arsenal</strong></p><p>Three new heavy weapons (Semi-automatic rifle, Scattergun, Rotary Cannon) and three new grenades (Freeze, Healing, Black Rock) add firepower and tactical variety.</p><p><strong>New Threats</strong></p><p>Five new enemies join the fight, including two mold foes exclusive to the Outbreak Crisis—the Mold Walker and Mold Turret—as well as three new Hiss threats with variants across the game: the Corrupted Ranger, Corrupted Ranger (Airborne), and the Demolition Expert.</p><p><strong>Economy Overhaul</strong></p><p>Every weapon and piece of equipment is fully powered the moment you unlock it—no more upgrading. Gear is unlocked simply by playing and leveling up. A smaller set of streamlined currencies now focuses on unlocking cosmetics and Perk upgrades.</p><p><strong>Improved Onboarding</strong></p><p>A new tutorial level, orientation videos, and a redesigned early-game flow ensure new players hit the ground running and existing players can bring friends along more easily.</p><p><strong>Gameplay &amp; Quality-of-Life Updates</strong></p><ul><li>Players now have access to full Crisis Kits from level 1, meaning their Altered Augments and Improvised Devices are already unlocked</li><li>Devices and Augments are usable more frequently and tuned to feel stronger and more impactful in play</li><li>Harmful Conditions are now visually more readable and no longer spread between players—no more reviving a burning teammate only to catch fire and repeat the cycle.</li><li>Sliding and moving while downed for greater mobility and survivability</li></ul><p>We hope that these changes and additions make <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> more welcoming to new players while deepening the challenge and customization for veterans.</p><p><strong>■ Roadmap (subject to change)</strong></p><p>“Breakpoint” is just the start of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>‘s live journey. Upcoming content includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Late November 2025</strong> – Major Update “Rogue Protocol” (tentative name) featuring a brand-new game mode + cross-platform voice chat</li><li><strong>March 2026</strong> – Next Major Update</li></ul></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-launches-september-29]]></content:encoded>
