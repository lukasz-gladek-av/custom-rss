A release date was not announced. <span id="more-970687"></span></p><p>“We’re incredibly proud to partner with <a title="Companies > Panpipe Studio" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/panpipe-studio">Panpipe Studio</a> to bring <em>Colorbound</em> to life,” said Whitethorn Games CEO Dr. Matthew White in a press release. “This game is a beautiful celebration of heritage, family, and approachable game design—exactly the kind of heartfelt, inclusive, and accessible games we’re passionate about supporting. We can’t wait for players to experience Anku’s journey.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Whitethorn Games:</p><blockquote><p>A heartfelt, colorful puzzle platformer, the game draws inspiration from the rich culture of the indigenous Aymara people of the Andes. <em>Colorbound</em> immerses players in a warm, minimalistic setting as they guide a young boy on his journey to reunite his beloved late grandfather’s band for one final concert.</p><p>In <em>Colorbound</em>, the power of color is the key to opening up the path forward. Young Anku’s grandfather was a beloved musician whose band brought immense joy to their people. After his passing, Anku sets off on a journey to seek out the scattered musicians, help them to find their neglected instruments, and reunite them for a final tribute performance in memory of a great man. Equipped with the ability to harness the power of color to shape the environment around him, Anku must collect and add colors to his palette and use them to change the way he interacts with the world, and find ways to open up new paths. Combining light platforming with environmental and logic puzzles, players will lead him through each setting—from dusty deserts to cities in ruin to flourishing forests—and help him reach his goal.</p><p>Winner of the Latin American Game Showcase Game Jam 2025, and created under the theme “What the Eyes Don’t See, the Heart Doesn’t Feel,” <em>Colorbound</em> was not only a favorite of the Game Jam attendees, but of the jury selection as well. Drawing upon Panpipe’s Chilean traditions and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> blends traditional music and art in a celebration of the rich culture of Latin America.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Yet in the months that follow, Anna is haunted by visions of violence and death, compelling her to create disturbing drawings that rapidly manifest into horrifying reality.</p><p>Desperate to free her of this affliction, Caroline travels to the remote town of Villa Hess and a mysterious clinic nestled deep within the mountains of southern Chile. But behind the warm smiles of the facility’s serene staff lies a sickening truth, and the sisters soon find themselves at the center of an entirely new nightmare…</p><p><strong>So What’s Included in the Demo?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This first playable demo features roughly 60 minutes of gameplay, beginning with the sisters’ long journey to Villa Hess and their arrival at the convent-turned-clinic as recommended by Caroline’s long-standing friend and psychiatrist, Isabella. Greeted by the cheerful Sister Angelica, a member of the convent’s secretive sisterhood, the pair seem initially at ease. But during the night Caroline wakes to find Anna missing and following the sounds of her screaming, rushes headfirst into the horrifying scene of her sister’s abduction. Trapped in a stranglehold, Caroline begins to lose consciousness as the sisterhood’s matriarch, Mother Lucia reveals her plan to capture the Wildberger twins and continue the unthinkable work of their grandfather, Noah… </p><p>Coming around in the convent’s infirmary, Caroline must now navigate the claustrophobic passageways of the convent in search of her missing sister. But as she ventures deeper into the shadowy facility, she soon discovers that she is not alone and that an ancient evil calls from below…  </p><p><strong>An Insight Into Caroline’s New Look</strong></p><p>As many of our fans will know, <em><a title="Games > Tormented Souls [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tormented-souls">Tormented Souls</a></em> was initially conceived as a love letter to the iconic third-person survival horror titles of the 90s and early 00s. These games shared some fairly outlandish plots as well as memorable protagonists whose designs effortlessly combined B-movie horror aesthetics with the eye-catching fashion trends of the time. Looking back on Claire Redfield’s Queen-quoting biker jackets in <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil 2 (2019) [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-2-2019">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em>Code Veronica</em>, and Aya Brea’s none-more-nineties denim in <em>Parasite Eve II</em> got us thinking about our design for Caroline Walker in <em>Tormented Souls II</em>. Had we moved too far away from our influences? Would Caroline’s silhouette still be recognizable? What would Caroline think about her militaristic, combat-ready new look?</p><p>These questions led us to revisit her design once more, going over and picking out all the key details of her outfit from the original game, and seeking to “evolve” her look for the sequel. The most important point was that following the events of the first game, Caroline has grown up. She’s very much in BIG SISTER mode now, and so needs to look suitably mature. This is reflected in her color palette, with the blood red of her dress contrasting dramatically with the scuffed leather of her jacket, which conveniently helps to pick her out of the multitude of dark environments that she’ll be exploring throughout the game.</p><p>We also wanted to retain elements of her design so as to keep her silhouette relatively consistent between games. This meant bringing back the dress and jacket combo, as well as Caroline’s taste for floral patterns, bows, and leather. Some of you might remember the evolution of The Prince’s design from <em><a title="Games > Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2026) [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-2026">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em> to <em>Warrior Within</em>. Across games, he retained his flowing sash, chunky arm bracers, and loose-fitting trousers, but undeniably looks more bad-ass in the sequel. This is very much the approach we took with Caroline’s new look, and we hope our players will enjoy the familiarity it now brings! Also bonus points for anyone who noticed the Alice Abernathy reference.</p></blockquote><p><em>Tormented Souls II</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464280/Tormented_Souls_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/tormented-souls-2-28a1eb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tormented_souls_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>“Sisterhood” Story Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tormented Souls 2 | 'Sisterhood' Story Teaser Trailer - Steam Demo OUT NOW!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEAIvincLiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We wanted to create something different, a space where players can exhale. A space that values listening, empathizing, and slow, intentional conversations. With <em>Fireside Feelings</em>, we hope to inspire joy, catharsis, and connection through something as simple—and human—as sharing words beneath the stars.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via The CoLab:</p><blockquote><p>Following a philosophy that “we all need a good talk under the stars,” <em>Fireside Feelings</em> sees players sharing heartfelt and empathetic thoughts about diverse—and sometimes challenging—topics.</p><p>Players choose and customize their avatar from one of six different animals, including a besuited bear, a barista bee and a skater fox. Once selected, players begin their journey across meditative locales, including a beach, woodland and a record store.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>There they’ll meet Spark, a sentient campfire guiding them through a series of questions inspiring thoughtful and empathetic answers under the stars. Sat on the other side of the fire is a second animal, sharing another player’s previous answers to the same questions and forming a contemplative, yet asymmetrical, conversation on the chosen topic.</p><p>To provide a highly robust level of player safety, <em>Fireside Feelings</em> anonymizes answers and the player’s in-game character name. Responses given by the other player across the campfire are not live, but chosen from a moderated database of conversations.</p><p>Furthermore, sensitive topics that might be discussed and might be triggering for players—including violence, self-harm, mental illness and more—can be avoided by removing them from the discussion at the start of the game or via the main menu.</p><p>Team Empreintes and The CoLab have worked with Safe In Our World, the games industry’s mental health charity, to integrate a link to the Safe In Our World website from within the experience, where players can access resources and support.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Fireside Feelings Launch Trailer - Wholesome Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3j3JRzardU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
