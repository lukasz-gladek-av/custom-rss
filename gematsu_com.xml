The stories unfold in both the real world and the fantasy world within the game. The first title in the series, <em>.hack//Infection</em>, was released in 2002 through Bandai Namco Entertainment, and three seasons were published in total. The franchise expanded to anime, novels, manga, OVAs and more, pioneering cross-media worldbuilding by telling varying stories from the same universe.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Executive Producer:</strong> Hiroshi Matsuyama</li><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> Seiichiro Hosokawa</li><li><strong>Creative Producer / Art Division General <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger:</strong> Akihiro Anai</li><li><strong>Creative Director:</strong> Hiroto Niizato</li><li><strong>Art Division General Manager:</strong> Takahito Washisaka</li><li><strong>Program Division General Manager:</strong> Yasuhiko Tsuneoka</li><li><strong>Game Design Division General Manager:</strong> Tomoyuki Kato</li><li><strong>Sound Division General Manager:</strong> Norikatsu Fukuda</li><li><strong>Theme Music:</strong> Taro Hakase</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> Chikayo Fukuda</li><li><strong>Art Logo Design:</strong> Makoto Miyoshi</li><li><strong>Creative Producer Manager:</strong> Hironori Yamaoka</li><li><strong>Director Manager:</strong> Yohei Ishibashi</li><li><strong>Producer:</strong> Taichiro Miyazaki, Yuki Nishikawa</li></ul></blockquote><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142" target="_blank">Famitsu</a>, CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama said the title <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em> reflects the messaging of “restarting <em>.hack</em> from zero,” and has no connection to the <em>.hack//ZERO</em> light novel series by Yokote Michiko.</p><p>The story, set roughly 10 years in the future, will once again center around the in-game MMORPG “The World,” but with a greater focus on real-world drama. While previous entries in the <em>.hack</em> series were limited in their depictions of the real world to emails and web browsers due to budget and publisher constraints, no such constraints will exist for <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>.</p><p>Matsuyama said the series has always explored themes of duality between worlds, and the monochrome teaser visual is meant to reflect that contrast—such as “public persona vs. inner feelings” and the “dual nature of reality and games.”</p><p>While the genre is RPG, gameplay will incorporate both <a title="Genres > Action [3,410 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> elements. The development team is comprised of both series veterans and younger staff. The teaser trailer was produced by Kamikaze Douga and does not feature any in-game footage.</p><p>In related news, the Weekly Famitsu No. 1936, due out on February 19, will feature a 30-page special on CyberConnect2’s 30th anniversary, including an overview of <em>CECILE</em>, the second title in the company’s “<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2020/07/fuga-melodies-of-steel-news-coming-soon-tokyo-ogre-gate-and-cecile-not-yet-in-active-development">Trilogy of Vengeance</a>” series.</p><p>Watch the <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em> teaser trailer below.
