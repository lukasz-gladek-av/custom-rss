The first event, “Chip Fever,” will run from October 28 to November 4. <span id="more-1000804"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>During each event period, you can tackle a special Emerald Rush challenge that shakes up the usual formula by setting some fixed conditions, such as the Emerald Perks you can obtain from fossils and Banandium Gems. You’ll still be able to select your Emerald Perk from three choices, but the options presented to you will remain the same during each run.</p><p>Achieve the challenge’s target scores and you’ll be rewarded with certain character statues and Banandium Chips, which can be exchanged for standard statues. Don’t worry if you don’t get it the first time—you can retry as many times as you’d like within the event period!</p><p>The first event, “Chip Fever,” will take place from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251028T0800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 28 at 1 a.m. PT / 4:00 a.m. ET</a> until <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20251104T0759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 3 at 11:59 p.m. PT / November 4 at 2:59 a.m. ET</a>.
