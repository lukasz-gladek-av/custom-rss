The sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> follows the steps of its predecessor including a brand new protagonist and a large interconnected world! After the events of the first game, the Queen of Light must stop the destruction of the very existence by challenging the Supreme God Chaos while seeking the location of their old nemesis.</p><p><strong>A New Installment in the <em>Aeterna</em> Universe</strong></p><p>The unforeseen consequences after the ending of <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> broke the balance between Light and Darkness. The Queen of Light awakes alone in a changing world at the edge of the void. It’s up to her luminous majesty to find answers and stop the end of all things.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe continues to expand with the highly anticipated sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>. This time players will take on the role of the other monarch cursed by the will of the Supreme God Chaos., a protagonist featuring new abilities and bearing the responsibility of saving everything that has existed and will exist.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,535 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Adventure First and Foremost</strong> – You’ll explore new areas interconnected in a large world map full of secrets, secondary quests, and evils to defeat. As the Queen of Light, you must uncover the mysteries of a land never seen before in the franchise and gather allies to stop the imminent collapse of space and time. The variety of settings is enormous, as is an artistic direction that gives each area a unique personality.</li><li><strong>Fast-Paced Gameplay</strong> – Every action adventure title focused on combat and exploration needs a fast-paced combat system and tons of passive and offensive skills… Guess what, both requirements are featured in <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>. The formula already implemented in its predecessor is now fully upgraded including much more polished combat controls, brand-new abilities, and exclusive weapons for the Queen of Light.</li><li><strong>Level Design and Progress</strong> – The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls and complete liberty to explore and discover alternative routes. This is an action adventure game, remember? As you become more skilled and the Queen of Light gets new abilities, <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> allows players to exploit the full potential of their character in confrontations against final bosses that promise a visual, sound, and playable spectacle.</li><li><strong>Unique Art Direction</strong> – Since <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>, the franchise’s universe has always been characterized by a coherent art design that makes all gameplay areas, enemies, and NPCs feel part of the same world. Using our trademark stained glass art and hand drawing, all the settings and graphic elements stand out for their meticulous attention to detail. The music, another of the pillars of the game, will allow you to enjoy from the most epic moments to the most relaxing ones with a sound quality on par with the great titles of the genre.</li><li><strong>Rich Storyline</strong> – The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe uses dialogues, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling that don’t interfere with the player’s progress and the general flow of the game. <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> is no exception and introduces a lot of new details about the franchise’s lore and the secrets behind the curse of the two monarchs.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser and Gameplay Reveal Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Aeterna Lucis - Official Teaser &amp; Gameplay Reveal | The Sequel to Aeterna Noctis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDjIQ89JEGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-948467-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4</a></video></p><p>Castles are just one of many activities in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> that you can complete to increase your Knowledge Rank, which gives you access to higher level abilities and upgrades. Completing them will also earn you experience and mastery points, which you can use to directly upgrade Naoe and Yasuke’s abilities. Additionally, Castles are full of resources that you can claim for your hideout. Smaller resource bundles can be picked up manually, while larger stockpiles can be tagged by Naoe and Yasuke to be picked up and delivered to your hideout by scouts at the changing of the seasons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>■ Naoe <a title="Genres > Stealth [75 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4</a></video></p><p>Our walkthrough begins with Naoe’s stealthy approach at night. After dispatching a perimeter guard with her Hidden Blade, she quickly takes to the rooftops with the help of her grappling hook and begins to scout out nearby patrols. Unlike recent games in the series, in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you won’t have the ability to call upon an avian ally to scout from the skies for you. Instead, you’ll hold L2 to use the Observe mechanic and focus Naoe or Yasuke’s vision on an enemy / objective / loot to tag it.</p><p>While scouting, Naoe spots a Samurai Daisho, an elite guard that will have to be eliminated to conquer the tenshu and claim its ultimate reward. With her tanto blade equipped, Naoe can double assassinate targets, but the Samurai Daisho’s ample health means she can’t take him out with one hit… yet. Shadows’ gear not only offers distinct stat bonuses but unique engravings that can change your strategy at any moment. In this case, Naoe swaps her headgear to a piece that gives bonus damage on air assassinations—enough to take out the Samurai Daisho in a single blow.</p><p>Further into the castle, Naoe calls for help from one of her recruited allies, Gennojo. He’s able to stun a pair of nearby enemies allowing Naoe to close the gap and take them both out. Gennojo is just one of several recruitable allies that can be called up in the open world for help (fun fact, each ally is summoned with a different bird call). Once those guards are taken out, Naoe uses Eagle Vision to scope out the interior of a nearby building.</p><p>Hostile enemies appear in red in eagle vision, while civilians will cast an orange silhouette. Be warned, however: just because civilians won’t attack you, that doesn’t mean they won’t raise the alarm if they spot you. Thankfully, Naoe is able to utilize a host of new stealth features to avoid detection. She starts by extinguishing a nearby lantern, cloaking herself in darkness. She then uses her grappling hook to pull herself up to the ceiling to avoid a patrol before dropping down and assassinating a second Samurai Daisho through a shoji door with her katana.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Stealth Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4</a></video></p><p>Now, let’s flip to Yasuke as he approaches the palace. Yasuke may be a one-man army in Shadows, but he’s still capable of sneaking around. Without a grappling hook, he uses a nearby low-hanging tree to take to the rooftops before pulling out his bow to silently take out a guard from range. Then, while crouching, he sneaks up on another guard and dispatches him with a brutal assassination with his long katana. It’s not as inconspicuous as a Hidden Blade, but hey, it gets the job done and doesn’t alert anyone else in the area.</p><p>Yasuke’s infiltration takes place during the daytime, so he doesn’t have the benefit of hiding in the shadows that Naoe did, but by sticking to the rooftops and using the geometry of the pitched roofs, he can stay hidden while crawling prone. Here, Yasuke calls upon another ally, Oni-Yuri, a poison specialist who can knock multiple enemies unconscious.</p><p>As he moves into the next courtyard, Yasuke spots a bell tower that can alert the entire tenshu to his presence should he be noticed, but with his bow (or Naoe’s shuriken or kunai), he can disarm the bell tower. Now, it’s time to go loud and make an entrance to take out the final Samurai Daisho. Yasuke starts by shooting a gunpowder barrel with his bow, taking out a nearby guard, before switching out his bow for a massive kanabo club. The hulking weapon’s blows overwhelm the Samurai Daisho, earning Yasuke another mastery point.</p><p><strong>■ Naoe Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4</a></video></p><p>Swapping back to Naoe for a combat approach, we see just how skilled a fighter she can be. This begins by exchanging her stealth gear for a more combat-focused headgear and armor that allows her to vault enemies by sprinting at them and knock them down by sliding into them. Finally, her tanto is replaced with a legendary kusarigama that increases damage to enemies over three meters away. The kusarigama is Naoe’s long range melee weapon, great for crowd control and fighting multiple enemies at once. It also enables Naoe to rush assassinate her targets (rush assassinate is a passive ability that is possible whenever the kusarigama is one of Naoe’s two equipped weapons and does not cost adrenaline to use) by wrapping one end of the kusarigama around them and using it to fling herself forward for the killing blow.</p><p>Once Naoe gets to an elevated position, she realizes that a servant that spotted her earlier has returned with reinforcements. Rather than dealing with them herself, she calls her ally Yaya, a hulking brawler, to take care of them for her. With the reinforcements handled, Naoe is able to use the Observe mechanic to scout out Takahashi Shiro, a member of The Twisted Tree family she’s been tasked to assassinate. This time around, Naoe’s air assassination attempt only does partial damage, meaning she has a fight on her hands. Using a combination of smoke bombs and her kusarigama, she makes quick work of the weaker guards as she dances around Shiro, dismantling his armor before going in for the killing blow. With her target assassinated and the Samurai Daisho eliminated, Naoe is free to scale Nijo Tenshu and open the chest, earning a new legendary armor set for Yasuke. Her run ends with her scaling the tenshu for a synchronization point, using the Observe mechanic to scout our nearby points of interest.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4</a></video></p><p>We end the walkthrough with Yasuke’s bread and butter, combat. As with Naoe, it begins with a gear swap as the katana and kanabo are replaced with a naginata and teppo (a single-shot rifle). Yasuke’s last armor was ideal for stealth as it provided a 200% damage bonus to ranged weapons while out of combat. This approach, however, will be loud so he needs a new armor set and thanks to a unique engraving, the new set allows him to parry unblockable attacks (red glowing attacks that can usually only be dodged). The armor pairs especially well with the accompanying helmet which grants 50% damage to the attacker on parry. Not only can Yasuke parry any attack now, but he’ll reflect 50% of that damage back on the attacker.</p><p>It’s not often you can go in “guns blazing” in an <em><a title="Series > Assassin's Creed [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> game, but that’s exactly what Yasuke does, smashing down the door before executing the closest guard with his teppo. With Yasuke’s size comes a certain boldness (he can take and dish out more damage than Naoe in a straight up fight) and he sprints straight through the courtyard to confront Takahashi Shiro. Wielding his naginata and parrying nearly every attack thrown at him, Yasuke quickly dispatches all the guards, and even takes out Shiro without too much difficulty. He may not be the climber that Naoe is, but Yasuke still ascends the tenshu to claim the prized chest and conquer Nijo Palace.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ two distinct heroes offer up dramatically different abilities, weapons, and playstyles, but Naoe and Yasuke are versatile enough to change up their approach, allowing you to sneak or fight on the fly.
