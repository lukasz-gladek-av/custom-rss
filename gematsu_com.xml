      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [23,048 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has released a seven-minute overview trailer for <em><a title="Games > Kirby Air Riders [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a></em>. <span id="more-1004913"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Ready, set, battle!</p><p>Charge, boost, and spin to attack your rivals in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, a fast-paced vehicle <a title="Genres > Action [3,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> featuring Kirby and crew.</p><p>Pick your rider, pick your machine, and mount up for competition! Take on your rivals in frantic arena battles or fast-paced races on the ground and in the air. Use the Boost Charge button to brake and control your turns as your machine automatically fights for top speed. Fill your Boost Charge gauge as you drift around the bend and release it to trigger an explosive dash!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Choose from a variety of riders like Kirby, <a title="Platforms > Meta [161 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a> Knight, King Dedede, and Magolor from <em>Kirby’s <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,681 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> <a title="Platforms > Wii [241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/wii">Wii</a></em>, and machines including the Warp Star, Wheelie Bike, Chariot, and more. Each machine handles differently, and each rider has their own set of stats and Specials—they can also grab Copy Abilities off their foes to get an edge in the fray.</p><p><strong>Rider Basics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Boost Into the Fray</strong> – Ride and battle with just two buttons. Press the Boost Charge button to brake, drift, and fill your Boost Charge Gauge as your machine moves forward automatically. Once it’s full, dash forward with gusto!</li><li><strong>Battle With Quick Spin</strong> – Wiggle the control stick to perform a spin attack. Slam into enemies to send them flying!</li><li><strong>Turn the Tide With Specials</strong> – Drive and fight to fill your Special Gauge. Once it’s full, you can activate your rider’s Special to edge out the competition.</li><li><strong>Grab Copy Abilities</strong> – Inhale or capture an enemy to receive their Copy Ability. Some Copy Abilities let you attack, while others give you bonuses like a speed increase.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kirby</strong> – A light and floaty friend to all! This well-balanced hero has no clear weaknesses.</li><li><strong>King Dedede</strong> – A heavyweight rider who rules the raceway! Hits hard with his powerful hammer.</li><li><strong>Meta Knight</strong> – A shadowy defender who slashes rivals with his sword and slices through the air on dark wings.</li><li><strong>Bandana Waddle Dee</strong> – A sturdy rider who builds Boost Charge quickly. His trusty spear stings rivals like a hornet!</li><li><strong>Knuckle Joe</strong> – A fierce fighter who jabs at riders that come too close. Charge up fully for a flurry of punches!</li><li><strong>Cappy</strong> – The mushroom cap doubles as a protective cushion. Race ahead of rivals before it falls apart!</li><li><strong>Star Man</strong> – Excels at airborne maneuvers. Jump for a burst of speed and soar right over your rivals!</li><li><strong>Magolor</strong> – A sly spell caster who accelerates a lot after Star Slides. Attack rivals ahead of you with perfect landings!</li><li><strong>Susie</strong> – A smug, shiny entrepreneur. Deploys a propeller to take off and float gently through the air.</li></ul><p><strong>Machines</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Warp Star</strong> – Both drives and glides perfectly well. An easy ride with no clear weaknesses.</li><li><strong>Winged Star</strong> – Slow when ground-bound, but soars gracefully whenever it takes flight.</li><li><strong>Wheelie Bike</strong> – Races ahead on a single wheel. An interesting design compared to star-type machines.</li><li><strong>Paper Star</strong> – Light as paper with impressive flight capabilities. Fragile, but offers excellent acceleration.</li><li><strong>Tank Star</strong> – Rushes forward on Boost Dashes. Boost Charges help it tackle turns at a rapid pace.</li></ul><p><strong>City Trial</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore Skyah</strong> – Zip around the city of Skyah in City Trial: a free-for-all battle for 16 players online* or eight players via local wireless.

Watch out for opponents looking to thwart you by destroying your machine…</li><li><strong>Field Events</strong> – Survive unpredictable Field Events like fearsome boss battles, falling meteors, and more!</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong> – The final challenge takes place at the Stadium! The challenge is chosen from one of four randomly selected options. Try and pick one that suits your powered-up machine.</li></ul><p><strong>Air Ride</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Race to the Finish</strong> – Drive, fight, and aim to cross the finish line first. Compete against a medley of riders in local and online matches with up to five other players.</li></ul><p><strong>Play with amiibo</strong></p><p>Mix and match in-game Figure Players with the new rider-machine dual pack amiibo figures! Each pack comes with one rider and machine, which together form a figure. You can change the combination of your riders and machines to make different figures, too.</p><p>Tap them into your game to play with your Figure Players! By racing together with them, their level and machine’s proficiency will increase.</p></blockquote><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on November 20.

        <p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey—pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision—thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying [intellectual property] is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we / NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out—we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/netease-games-closes-bad-brain-game-studios]]></content:encoded>
