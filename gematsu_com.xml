You play as R.E.A.C.H. – an artificial intelligence trapped in a human body against its own will, striving to adjust to human life, in and around Phoenix-City. Outlaws are rife in a society that has sustained lasting damage and taken a turn for the worse, following a catastrophic nuclear event. Everything is ruled by corruption and greed and the ones in power see humans and their organs as nothing more than currency. <em>REPLACED</em> focuses on a single-player experience, with a mix of cinematic platforming, pixel art and free-flow action combat.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
