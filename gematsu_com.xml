We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via NetEase Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Sea of Remnants</em> invites players into a visually captivating world, where they assume the role of a puppet-like sailor who has lost all their memories. Alongside a mysterious girl, players will voyage across vast seas, uncharted islands and a city slowly awakening to its secrets. Through open-world exploration, intense naval combat and dynamic interactions with a cast of over 300 eccentric characters, players will uncover the truth behind their forgotten identity and shape the fate of the world around them.</p><p>On this sprawling journey, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and build specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision—whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities—will unleash dramatic ripple effects across the world. With rival factions reacting to each choice and Orbtopia’s cityscape evolving in response, no two captains will share the same story.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
