It is rumored that this thing can cure a hundred diseases and regenerate nature. The rulers slaughtered extensively in order to collect more fragments, leading to separatist disputes and rampant monsters. This world seems to have become another hell. The protagonist is a member of a mysterious organization who sets foot on an ancient fortress in search of a divine artifact. They meet a group of cunning enemies and fight against the powerful enemies within the fortress, uncovering the truth behind the worldâ€™s curse of decay.</p><p><strong>Game Features, Integrated Themes, Fast-Paced Defense, and Counterattack Battles</strong></p><p>The ancient style is mystical and fantastical, with strange thoughts and deeds.
