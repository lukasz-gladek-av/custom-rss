To defeat and re-seal it, you will need to use the power of adorable Minions to create tiny heroes from the magic scroll.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p><p>This is a wave-based tower defense game. Build a factory to mass-produce heroes and prevent your gates from being demolished. You will not be able to command your heroes directly. The only thing you can do is build your factory. Nothing more.</p><p>Each wave of enemies will be stronger than the last. Use the unique artifacts (facilities) that you earn as rewards to reinforce your factory and stand your ground.

        <p>In the vast and peaceful sea lies Rataport, a vibrant island bustling with life. Here, the Ratatans, mysterious yet charming creatures, live in harmony with their friends. Though they differ in appearance and personality, they share a single dream: to journey to The Everafter and meet the legendary Goddess said to reside there. Fueled by hope, the Ratatans set out on their adventure, undeterred by failure, determined to one day stand before her.</p><p>The Ratatans are groove-loving adventurers that use the power of song and magical instruments called Melodium to command their armies of Cobun. Lead your troops by issuing rhythmic commands, guiding them through massive dynamic battles where strategic positioning, timely orders, and well-planned retreats will be the key to your success!</p><p><strong>Rhythm Commands and Cobun Orders</strong></p><p>Feel the beat and use rhythm commands in time with the music to order your Cobun in the direction you want them to go. The Ratatan can be moved freely, so use your better judgment to decide where best to give orders, where to stand when on the offensive, and when to retreat. A sense of rhythm and strategy is crucial in order to survive long adventures while losing as few Cobun as possible!</p><p><strong>Fever System</strong></p><p>Keep to the beat and your party will enter FEVER MODE, a feature no good <a title="Genres > Rhythm [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a> can do without! Feel the vibes shift as the background music dynamically changes and your Cobun erupt in a flurry of frenzied dance moves that’ll really get the heart pumping! And if everyone’s party goes into FEVER MODE at the same time, you’ll really bring the house down!</p><p><strong>Adorable 2d Animations</strong></p><p><em>Ratatan</em> makes use of charming 2D animation with movements filled with vivid personality. The Cobun, your faithful and lovable servants, will wibble-wobble as they follow your orders, while your enemies will try to intimidate with their often hilarious movements, breathing even more life into the world of <em>Ratatan</em>.</p><p><strong>Toe-Tapping Soundtrack</strong></p><p>Now, what kind of troupe would you be leading without the perfect tune to march your minions to?! Worry not! We’ve got you covered with the perfect musical accompaniment by veteran composer Kemmei Adachi for crushing your enemies in a wave of adorable terror!</p><p>Created by Hiroyuki Kotani (Patapon) and developed by Ratata Arts in collaboration with TVT Co., Ltd., the game features 100+ controllable characters, rhythm-driven combat, and a vibrant world of music, monsters, and multiplayer madness. The soundtrack features music by veteran composer Kemmei Adachi, with a special guest track by David Wise.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ratatan-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-on-september-19]]></content:encoded>
