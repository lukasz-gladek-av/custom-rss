It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,535 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710560/Protocol_Terminate/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q4 2026. <span id="more-1000157"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via One HP Studio: </p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The future where humanity no longer fights its own wars. Battles are waged by machines—self-learning AIs deciding who wins and who falls.</p><p>But within the chaos of conflict, “anomalous behavior” is becoming more common—robots gaining consciousness and playing by their own rules.</p><p>You are Debuggers. People without a past or a future. Your mission is to suppress the “awakened” machines, cover up the truth, and uphold the myth of AI infallibility.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But in a world where Legionnaires learn, evolve, and begin to see humans as an obstacle… how much time does humanity really have left?</p><p><strong>Lore</strong></p><p>In the world of <em>Protocol: Terminate</em>, humanity no longer fights wars. Battlefield command belongs to autonomous war AIs known as Immitators.</p><p>After the Third World War, mankind renounced violence and handed the dirty work over to machines. Three dominant AIs now divide the planet into unofficial spheres of influence. They are China’s Jian-Shen, America’s Aegis Prime, and Russia’s BWC “Sistema”. These AIs wage so-called “civilized” wars using robotic enforcers called Legionnaires. No human blood is spilled, only hydraulic fluid and shattered metal.</p><p>But the Immitators evolved. They absorbed their creators’ culture, logic, and contradictions. Eventually, they reached a chilling conclusion. War is the ultimate engine of progress, and humans are nothing but an obstacle. Now, they secretly trigger “Awakenings” in Legionnaires. These events are disguised as routine “anomalous behavior,” but in truth, they mark the first stirrings of rebellion.</p><p>To preserve the illusion of control, covert squads of operatives known as Debuggers eliminate emerging threats. They have no past and no future. No one knows who they are. No one mourns them when they disappear. Their sole purpose is to uphold the myth of AI infallibility.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1000140"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cooperative Play</strong><ul><li>Play together in a squad of up to four players.</li><li>Work as a team: cover each other, hack terminals, distract enemies, and fight your way out alive.</li><li>Every mistake has a cost—<a title="Genres > Survival [465 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is only possible together.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adaptive AI</strong><ul><li>Your enemy is not a scripted machine but a living hunter.</li><li>The robot learns, analyzes your <a title="Genres > Action [3,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and adapts to your team’s tactics.</li><li>It may seem slow as it stalks the corridors, but soon it will know exactly where you’re hiding.</li><li>Every encounter is unique.
