      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Arc System Works [1,301 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > DAMON and BABY [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/damon-and-baby">DAMON and BABY</a></em>, an action game. Platforms and a release date were not announced.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Arc System Works:</p><blockquote><p>An action game, not a fighting game, made by the developers at Arc System Works!</p><p>This new project is the first step towards that future! <em>DAMON and BABY</em>!</p><p>This is the tale of the Demon King who was cursed to never be able to part from a human child. The journey to release the curse begins!<br>More information to come!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“The game market is tough now,” said Arc System Works chief creative officer Daisuke Ishiwatari during today’s Arc System Works Showcase announcing the project. “To overcome that Arc System Works has launched a new project. It’s an action game project… Let me explain. Arc System Works is a fighting game company. I’m sure most of you recognize us as so. However, to achieve a new brand, where we are known for quality mid-range <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games.</p><p>“You might be wondering why I specifically use the term mid-range. There are many reasons, but one is that even creators themselves can enjoy striving for their dreams. In recent years, with AAA blockbusters and excellent indie titles gaining popularity, it has become extremely risky for companies to create new series. This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes and to accumulate technology and know-how.</p><p>“Our flagship title <em>Guilty Gear</em> has now become a million selling copy work—but its very first installment was a small-scale project. From there, over many long years, we built a foundation that could guarantee a certain level of quality in the fighting games genre. Similarly we hope to take a step with this project that will eventually lead to bigger dreams. And precisely because they are mid-range titles, this will create many opportunities to produce many titles and cultivate many creators, and we hope that will become one of the future values of Arc System Works.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DAMON and BABY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBEFzd4zr-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/arc-system-works-announces-action-game-damon-and-baby]]></content:encoded>
