    <p><span>A deeper look at IO Interactive's original take on the origin of James Bond.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released the story trailer and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em>. <span id="more-1026404"></span></p><p>“With <em>007 First Light</em>, we set out to reimagine the origin of James Bond, exploring the formative moments that shape him into the agent players know, but not yet the legend he will become,” said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak in a press release. “This is a version of Bond who is still inexperienced and finding his footing in the world of espionage, yet already defined by the instincts, intelligence, and resolve that set him apart. Players will recognize the unmistakable qualities that make him Bond from the very beginning.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Revealed during today’s Sony PlayStation State of Play, the story trailer sets the stage for a global intrigue, as Bond is recruited into MI6 and enters the world of espionage, full of hidden agendas and unseen threats. The trailer offers early glimpses of Bond’s exploits in Iceland, showcasing his decisive judgment, nerve, and resourcefulness that draw the attention of MI6, propelling him into the grueling training of the newly revived 00 programme. Still inexperienced and sometimes reckless, Bond (portrayed by Patrick Gibson) will have to confront his instincts with the structure and discipline of his new world, where initiative is not always rewarded, and obedience is often the expectation.</p><p>As he enters the world of espionage, Bond discovers an unexpected advocate in M (portrayed by Priyanga Burford), who recognizes his potential as an agent able to take control of desperate situations and complete his objectives, following his own judgment. John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a former 00 agent and the programme’s training instructor, stands in contrast to Bond. A disciplined, by-the-book operative, Greenway’s strict philosophy quickly clashes with Bond’s instinctive and improvisational approach in the field. </p><p>Despite their differences, Bond and Greenway are forced to work together as the resurgence of 009, a former British operative now turned rogue, becomes the newly revived 00 programme’s first true test in the field. From the quiet Carpathian Mountains to the dangerous black market of Aleph, Bond’s pursuit takes him across the globe, leading him to the unpredictable Bawma (portrayed by Lenny Kravitz) and more. Bond will also have to contend with mysterious characters, such as Charlotte Roth (portrayed by Noemie Nakai), and determine where their loyalties lie before choosing who to trust.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
