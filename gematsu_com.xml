      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Tlon Industries [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tlon-industries">Tlon Industries</a> has released a demo for <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [896 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> base-building <a title="Genres > Survival [372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival game</a> <em><a title="Games > Kentum [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kentum">Kentum</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165140/Kentum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <span id="more-942921"></span></p><p>The demo features the opening hours of the game, allowing players to explore its first region, craft machines, decorate their base, and more.</p><p>“<em>Kentum</em> is a complex, systems-heavy game, so we wanted to ensure that the demo is hefty enough to let players really get a sense of the <em>Kentum</em>‘s scope,” said Tlon Industries game director Roque Rey in a press release. “Of course, the final game will contain A LOT more content, with new regions to explore, creatures to encounter, modules to expand your base, and gear to wear. <em>Kentum</em> is a very expressionistic, open-ended game, so we want to ensure players can survive the post apocalypse their own way!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and demo, via Tlon Industries:</p><blockquote><p><em>Kentum</em> places players in the role of a man awakening from a very, very long nap. After 7,000 years in suspended animation, he awakens to find himself seemingly the last man on earth. With no one else to rely on, you must scour for resources and use advanced technology to create your own home base to sustain your survival.</p><p>This demo lets players go through the opening hours of <em>Kentum</em>, exploring its first region. While the demo contains plenty of machines to craft and base decorations, far more awaits in the full game, which includes fauna machines, drones and advanced optimization options.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Kentum</em> lets players explore post-post-apocalyptic landscapes with dynamically changing climates and seasons full of unknown forms of flora and fauna. From trash mountains to desolate ruins, each area is filled with secrets to discover and challenges to overcome – like extreme weather and low gravity. Gather resources, fight newly evolved predators, harvest life-forms, and adapt to the hazardous, ever-changing world of 10,000 AD!</p><p>With no civilization you need to ensure that your house is more than a home; it must also be a factory. You’ll have to craft new automatization machinery and creatively combine your findings to optimize your own self-regulating habitat. Create your own farms, craft coal and ingots, build claws and conveyor belts. And don’t forget to decorate the place, as increasingly complex pipelines could be an eyesore. After all, this is the one environment you have control over, so you might as well make it personal to you!</p></blockquote><p><em>Kentum</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165140/Kentum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
