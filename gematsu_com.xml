It includes the 2021 re-release of <em><a title="Games > Corpse Party (2021) [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/corpse-party-2021">Corpse Party</a></em>, <em>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</em>, <em>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash</em>, and <em>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</em>.</p><p>Here is the full message from XSEED Games on the canceled release:</p><blockquote><p><em>Corpse Party</em> fans,</p><p>We know how much you were anticipating the release of the <em>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</em>. Though we previously released entries in the <em>Corpse Party</em> series on console platforms and digital storefronts in the west, we were informed that the contents of several games in the <em>Tetralogy Pack</em> did not comply with current platform guidelines. As a result, we are unable to release these games as intended and have subsequently canceled the physical release of <em>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</em>, as well as the digital offerings of previously unreleased <em>Corpse Party</em> games featured in the <em>Tetralogy Pack</em>.</p><p>We apologize for any confusion and disappointment this may have caused. We remain committed to working with our partners at <a title="Companies > MAGES. [542 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/colopl/mages">MAGES.</a> to bring <em><a title="Games > Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/corpse-party-ii-darkness-distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a></em> to the west and will share more details on its release when we can. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of XSEED Games and the <em>Corpse Party</em> franchise.</p><!-- AD: content -->
