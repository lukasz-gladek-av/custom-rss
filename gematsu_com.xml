It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2027. <span id="more-960742"></span></p><p>Here are the first details:</p><blockquote><p>With the studio‚Äôs proprietary Liquid Engine, which powered not only the original <em>Frostpunk</em> but also <em>This War of</em> Mine, no longer in development, the team has long sought a new foundation to carry forward the legacy of the first game. While <em><a title="Games > Frostpunk 2 [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a></em> continues to forge ahead with free major content updates, a console launch, and downloadable content, this newly announced project marks a return to the franchise‚Äôs roots, offering both newcomers and longtime citizens of New London an evolved take on the harsh, morally challenging survival experience that started it all.</p><p>But <em>Frostpunk 1886</em>‚Äîso titled to honor a pivotal moment in the timeline of the universe, when the Great Storm descended upon New London‚Äîis no mere visual overhaul. It builds upon the core of the original, expanding it with new content, mechanics, laws, and‚Äîperhaps most excitingly‚Äîan entirely new Purpose path, offering a fresh experience even for the most seasoned players.</p><p>Reimagining <em>Frostpunk</em> in Unreal Engine also allows the game to become a living, expandable platform, bringing with it long-awaited mod support‚Äîa community request that was previously impossible to realize due to technical limitations of the original engine‚Äîas well as the possibility to add future downloadable content content.</p><p><em>Frostpunk 1886</em> is set for release in 2027, with development having already begun in early 2025. The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios‚Äîone focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>More details, including a deeper look at the game, will be unveiled in the months ahead.</p><p>In the meantime, fans can look forward to a future where <em>Frostpunk 2</em> and <em>Frostpunk 1886</em> evolve side by side‚Äîtwo paths forged in parallel, each carrying the vision of survival into unrelenting cold.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
