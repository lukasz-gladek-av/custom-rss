    <p><span>First in-game look at the cyberpunk first-person shooter.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > emptyvessel [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/emptyvessel">emptyvessel</a> has released a pair of gameplay reveal trailers and new screenshots for cyberpunk <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,809 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> <em><a title="Games > DEFECT [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/defect">DEFECT</a></em>. <span id="more-1002175"></span></p><p>“Our entire emptyvessel team is incredibly excited to show off this first look at gameplay in <em>DEFECT</em> as we’ve poured a ton of passion and time into <a title="Genres > Crafting [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the game’s tone, atmosphere, and underlying systems,” said emptyvessel founder and game director Emanuel Palalic in a press release. “<em>DEFECT</em> is a HUD-less immersive <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> where any wall can be destroyed, gadgets and tools completely redefine how you approach combat, and every weapon or ammo type affects the world, interactables, and enemies in unique ways. The world is filled with emergent moments and dynamic branching narratives that react to player <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s in real time.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The <em>DEFECT</em> gameplay trailer kicked off [Galaxies Autumn 2025] and to further delight the audience, emptyvessel surprised fans with a second gameplay trailer post-show. The extended five-minute cut was introduced by studio founder Emanuel Palalic, and offered more gameplay by showing off a squad of THE SYSTEM’S heavily armed police forces storming the grimy halls of a massive apartment complex to terminate a rogue artificial intelligence. They’re quickly given a warm welcome by the ruthless gang lording over the complex, drawing each faction into an explosive firefight that tears the environment to shreds. A quick-thinking officer is able to hijack the consciousness of an unfortunate gang member which allows him to revive a downed teammate by placing them into the mind of this gang member thereby making them part of the friendly team until the end of the match. The squad of police descend further into the guts of the building in order to reboot the entire block, taking their final stand while soaking in the neon lights and lasers of an underground dancefloor. The two-minute short-form version of the gameplay trailer condenses the action down to the highlights in all their destructive glory.</p><p>Initially announced in 2024, <em>DEFECT</em> is a new squad-based cyberpunk shooter, from the creative minds of emptyvessel. <em>DEFECT</em> delivers a new kind of experience through its immersive and highly tactical combat for fans of the action shooter genre. The game is set in a futuristic, divided city ruled by an enigmatic AI known as “THE SYSTEM” all while ruthless gangs and rogue law enforcement vie for supremacy. <em>DEFECT</em> is being created by industry-leading developers behind iconic franchises including <em>DOOM</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>The Last of Us</em>; and features music from legendary composer Mick Gordon.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002177"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The world of <em>DEFECT</em> is like none other and dominated by one rule: Chaos Above All. Players will revel in the anarchy of a city on the brink. Set in the last city of mankind, where THE SYSTEM, an authoritarian AI, rules with inhuman logic. Choose from a collection of dangerous factions—THE SYSTEM’S own policing force, Rogue Police Elements, or a host of gangs vying for power. Players will compete to achieve objectives like smuggling guns, assassinating targets, or arresting suspects. Suit up with state-of-the-art weaponry and technology to give yourself the edge you need to live another day. </p><p>Every mission is different, whether you’re acting as the law, the lawless, or those caught in between. Choice will determine how the game is played with friends in single player, PvP or <a title="Genres > Co-Op [343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op multiplayer</a>. Squads of 4v4 players vie to complete multiple open-ended objectives, valuable items and enhancements that can change the tide of a battle, and the inevitable chaos means no firefight ends the exact same way.</p><p>With a passion for creating games that deliver immersive experiences, <em>DEFECT</em> serves as the inaugural title for emptyvessel. The game is being built using Unreal Engine 5, and utilizes the latest technology alongside the team’s vision for delivering unique and exciting gameplay experiences. </p></blockquote><p><em>DEFECT</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2470010/DEFECT/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/defect-dde0e6" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/defect" target="_blank">GOG</a>.

        <p>You’re changing the world of music. Your band’s tracks are the kind of art that redefines genres. That’s why you signed with a label that cares about creative freedom, right? You didn’t become sellouts, did you?</p><p>The road to success is a tricky one, and being a manager is a complex task. Will you help your band become rock rebels or sellouts? The choice is not always easy. <em>Rockbeasts</em> is set in the 90s United States, a time of grunge rock, raging capitalism, and music television.</p><p><strong>Coffee and Cigarettes for Breakfast</strong></p><p>“A kid once said to me ‘do you get hangovers?’ I said, ‘to get hangovers you have to stop drinking.” – Lemmy Kilmister</p><p>Somebody’s gotta make sure this bunch of misfits get ready for the gig. That’s where you come in. Make sure they get it together. There’s real potential here, but you’re gonna have to be the one that makes sure they make it through each week with a half-decent meal and a working amp.</p><p>strong&gt;Don’t Stop Me Now</p><p>“I won’t be a rock star. I will be a legend.” – Freddie Mercury</p><p>Pick the venue, prep the set and make sure it all goes according to plan. Pull it off and the band might just finally take those first steps to fame and glory. Sure, this one was in a grimy basement, but even the rock legends had to start somewhere, right?</p><p><strong>Encore</strong></p><p>We drew over 100 characters and 90 locations just for you! <em>Rockbeasts</em> is no EP, it’s a full double LP.</p><p>Every one of those characters is real, the choices you make will impact them. Your band members will change in time and so will your relationship with them.</p><p>In <em>Rockbeasts</em>, the tough choices as manager will be yours. Write your own rockstar legend where your decisions will shape the story.</p><p>Featuring voice actors from games including <em><a title="Games > Baldur's Gate III [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate III</a></em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [159 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>phor ReFantazio</em>, <em><a title="Games > Alan Wake II [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a></em>, and more.</p></blockquote><p><em>Rockbeasts</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/Rockbeasts/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer #2</span></h2><p><iframe title="ROCKBEASTS | Gameplay Trailer 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV4ULIZ6qyw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/rockbeasts-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
