      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bandai Namco Entertainment [6,803 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> executive game director, chief game producer, marketing director, and general manager Katsuhiro Harada will leave Bandai Namco after more than 31 years at the end of 2025, he <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" target="_blank">announced</a>.  <span id="more-1012317"></span></p><p>Harada is best known for his contributions to the <em>Tekken</em> series, which he has worked on since 1994 in various roles including director, producer, and executive producer.</p><p>Harada said the loss of several close friends in recent years led him to reflect on the “time I have left as a creator” led to his decision to leave Bandai Namco. As for his future plans, Harada will share more at a later date.</p><p>Here is the full message from Harada on his departure:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p><p>With the <em>Tekken</em> series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>I still remember carrying <a title="Genres > Arcade [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> cabinets by myself, encouraging people to a “Please try <em>Tekken</em>,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p><p>The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p><p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.</p><p>And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.</p><p>Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p><p>In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.</p><p>Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”</p><p>During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</p><p>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.</p><p>Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as <em>Summer Lesson</em>), <em>Pokken Tournament</em>, the <em>Soulcalibur</em> series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.</p><p>Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p><p>To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p><p>I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.</p><p>Thank you very much for everything.</p><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the [<em>Tekken</em>] World Tournament Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p><p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.</p><p>So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60-minute <em>Tekken</em> DJ-style nonstop mix</a> (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.</p><p>Listening to it brings back many memories.</p><p>Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p></blockquote><p>Bandai Namco also <a href="https://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178" target="_blank">shared</a> the following message regarding Harada’s departure and the future of the&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em> series:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Regarding the Departure of Katsuhiro Harada</strong></p><p>Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the <em>Tekken</em> series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the <em>Tekken</em> series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the <em>Tekken</em> community at the “<em>Tekken</em> World Tour 2025 Global Finals” Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 Finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026.</p><p><strong>Regarding the Future of the <em>Tekken</em> Series</strong></p><p>To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for <em><a title="Games > Tekken 8 [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a></em>.
