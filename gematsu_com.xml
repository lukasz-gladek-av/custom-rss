      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Riot Games [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/riot-games">Riot Games</a> will downsize the development team for <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> fighting game <em><a title="Games > 2XKO [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a></em> after player engagement failed to reach the level needed to continue supporting a team of its size, the company <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko" target="_blank">said</a>. Going forward, development will continue with a smaller team, focusing on “key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.” Impacted staff will either be offered other opportunities within Riot Games, or let go with at least six months severance. <span id="more-1025168"></span></p><p><em>2XKO</em> first launched in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,449 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> on October 7, 2025, followed by a full launch across <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,364 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,695 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and PC on January 20, 2026.</p><p>Here is the full update from Riot Games’ Tom Cannon:</p><blockquote><p>Hey Everyone,</p><p>I wanted to take a moment to share an important update on <em>2XKO</em>. This is a difficult update to share, but we want to be clear about what’s changing and why.</p><p><strong>What’s Changing and Why</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the <em>2XKO</em> team.</p><p>I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.</p><p>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</p><p>Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the FGC.</p><p>Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate. This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.</p><p><strong>About the People Behind the Game</strong></p><p>I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me.</p><p>The people who helped ship <em>2XKO</em> poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful.</p><p>We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition—including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of six months of notice pay and severance where it’s not.</p><p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p><p>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</p><p>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the <em>2XKO</em> community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</p><p>Thank you for playing <em>2XKO</em>, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community.</p><p>—Tom Cannon</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/2xko-team-to-downsize-following-lackluster-launch]]></content:encoded>
