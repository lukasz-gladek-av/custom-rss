The city of Wizarest has been cut off from the outside world for over a century, with its people living in isolation, stripped of their memories and surrounded by labyrinthine dungeons crawling with monsters. Claus discovers that his mentor and adoptive mother, the prodigal mage and alchemist, Giselle, has been missing since she went into the dungeons last month, and he vows to uncover the mystery behind her disappearance.</p><p>The citizens have been trying to navigate the dungeons for years but to no avail, and a century later, no exit has been found. It’s up to you, and the three artificial magical beings left to you by your mentor, Giselle, to explore the perilous dungeons, uncover the secrets behind the town’s and your own memory loss, and confront the force responsible for the world’s decay. Your friendly homunculus companions are able to absorb the souls of defeated monsters and evolve through “Anima Fusion”, allowing you to tailor your companions, changing their stats, abilities and appearance. Every decision you make throughout your adventure will affect your relationship with your companions, influence the storyline, and affect the outcome of the world’s fate, so choose your steps wisely!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
