In addition to being a resilient frontliner, Amon has a mechanically complex set of Action Skills with primary and secondary functions that’ll leave room for experimentation, even with the most experienced players.</p><p>In the Amon gameplay overview, you can watch Amon tear his enemies asunder with an arsenal of Forgeweapons, which take form via the Forgedrones stored within Amon’s cybernetic-enhanced beefcake body. Amon can attack or defend as needed, ready to pulverize enemies with a Forgehammer, slice them in twain with Forgeaxes, soak up damage with a Forgeshield, and much, much more.</p></blockquote><p><em>Borderlands 4</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,047 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> on September 12, followed by <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on October 3.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The deeper you go, the harsher it gets.</li><li><strong>Risk, Reward, and Craftsmanship</strong> – Choose your path through the forest carefully, manage your inventory, and extract with your loot before it’s too late. Resources are rare and space is limited. Decide what to take, what to leave, and how to transform scraps into vital tools, weapons, and supplies.</li><li><strong>A Grim 19th-Century Vision</strong> – Immerse yourself in a haunting world inspired by gothic horror and religious folklore with a hand-crafted, grim 19th-century aesthetic. Each playthrough is unique, shaped by the people you meet, the horrors you face, and the choices you make.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Peregrino - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a7BeEd3JVGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
