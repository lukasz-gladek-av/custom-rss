            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/frostpunk-1886-announced-for-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > 11 bit studios [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Frostpunk 1886" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/frostpunk-1886">Frostpunk 1886</a></em>, a new title in the <em>Frostpunk</em> franchise that revisits and expands upon the beloved city-builder and society <a title="Genres > Survival [410 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> experience of the original <em>Frostpunk</em>, reimagined in Unreal Engine 5. It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2027. <span id="more-960742"></span></p><p>Here are the first details:</p><blockquote><p>With the studio’s proprietary Liquid Engine, which powered not only the original <em>Frostpunk</em> but also <em>This War of</em> Mine, no longer in development, the team has long sought a new foundation to carry forward the legacy of the first game. While <em><a title="Games > Frostpunk 2 [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a></em> continues to forge ahead with free major content updates, a console launch, and downloadable content, this newly announced project marks a return to the franchise’s roots, offering both newcomers and longtime citizens of New London an evolved take on the harsh, morally challenging survival experience that started it all.</p><p>But <em>Frostpunk 1886</em>—so titled to honor a pivotal moment in the timeline of the universe, when the Great Storm descended upon New London—is no mere visual overhaul. It builds upon the core of the original, expanding it with new content, mechanics, laws, and—perhaps most excitingly—an entirely new Purpose path, offering a fresh experience even for the most seasoned players.</p><p>Reimagining <em>Frostpunk</em> in Unreal Engine also allows the game to become a living, expandable platform, bringing with it long-awaited mod support—a community request that was previously impossible to realize due to technical limitations of the original engine—as well as the possibility to add future downloadable content content.</p><p><em>Frostpunk 1886</em> is set for release in 2027, with development having already begun in early 2025. The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios—one focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>More details, including a deeper look at the game, will be unveiled in the months ahead.</p><p>In the meantime, fans can look forward to a future where <em>Frostpunk 2</em> and <em>Frostpunk 1886</em> evolve side by side—two paths forged in parallel, each carrying the vision of survival into unrelenting cold.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Organaizer of Sound Horizon, which established its unique style of “Story Music” from its major-label debut in 2004. Sound Horizon released its latest work, “Halloween to Asa no Monogatari,” on March 5, 2025. On the occasion of providing <em>Bravely Default</em> with its music in 2012, Revo began a new project called Linked Horizon to foster musical collaborations with other productions. Linked Horizon provided the opening theme for the 2013 TV anime <em>Attack on Titan</em>, and performed in the Kohaku Uta Gassen that same year.</p><p><strong>■ Message from Tomoya Asano, <em>Bravely</em> Series General Producer</strong></p><p>Hello! This is Tomoya Asano, producer at Square Enix.</p><p>I’d like to start by talking about the motivation behind developing this game</p><p>A while ago, at the 10-year anniversary of the <em>Bravely Default</em> series, I thought to myself, “What can we do to please our supportive fans the most?”</p><p>That was the starting point.</p><p>It’s been a while since the 10-year anniversary, but I’m really glad that my wishes have come to fruition in this way.</p><p>“A classic, orthodox style RPG typical of Square Enix with beautiful, slightly elaborate graphics.”</p><p>This direction then went on to inspire <em>Octopath Traveler</em> and our other <a title="Series > HD-2D [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/hd-2d">HD-2D</a> titles later on. Looking back at the Japanese marketing materials from the time, the tagline “A new lineage of <a title="Genres > RPG [17,187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>” feels quite grandiose, but thankfully it does feel somewhat like a lineage now, and that is all down to our supportive fans. Thank you very much.</p><p>I hope that we can carry on this lineage into the future too, but if you haven’t played the original game, then I strongly recommend that you try out <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>, one of the games that started it all! The same goes for people who played the original game a while ago! (It’s much more beautiful and feels fresh!) I would be delighted if they could try it out too.</p><p>Thank you for all your support.</p></div><p><em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> is due out for Switch 2 on June 5.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
