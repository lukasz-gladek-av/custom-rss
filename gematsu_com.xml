A full release is planned across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-926260"></span></p><p>“We’ve been contemplating this decision for some time, but the feedback from the Steam Next Fest demo has been so invaluable that we’ve chosen to opt in for the Early Access launch model,” Dreamate said in a press release. “Simply put, we want to work closely with you, our fans, to make the full version of New Arc Line a truly unforgettable RPG experience.</p><p>“We know there are some players who are hesitant about a story-based game being released this way. Don’t worry though—the initial Early Access launch will only contain about a quarter of the main storyline. While we will be adding more areas and quests in several content updates leading up to the full release, we plan to bring in more side-quests and world-building content rather than progressing the main story too far. We will primarily focus on adding more classes, abilities, companions, and gameplay mechanics and working with the feedback we receive to make the underlying mechanics as balanced and fun to play as possible—so that when the full launch comes next year, everyone will have a reason to pick the game up again and make their mark on the New World.”</p><p>Information about the Early Access launch content will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Dreamate:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The New World looms on the horizon, on its shore the shining city of progress, and the last beacon of hope in your search for a cure to your family’s fatal disease—New Arc. You arrive to this foreign land by steerage of a steamship, cramped with thousands of other immigrants, a stranger in a strange land, full of wonder. But you will soon discover that the city’s beauty runs only skin-deep and all you find is rot beneath the golden facade.</p><p>Dark smoke from the factories chokes the skies, segregation, inequality, and corruption run rampant. You will have to rise from the very bottom, make tough decisions, and get your hands dirty if you are to succeed—and you must, no matter the cost!</p><p>Craft technopunk gear or master the arcane arts, fight, steal or smooth-talk your way to the top and become the hero or villain you want to be. You will not have to face the trials of this world alone, however; find your companions and gather your party, make foes and allies, fall in love, get involved in a massive conspiracy, and change the course of history forever.</p><p>Will you rise to the occasion?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become the Hero or the Villain You Want to Be</strong> – Create your own character as a Human, Elf, Dwarf or Giant, choose your gender, background and appearance. Keep in mind that inhabitants of this world might have their own prejudices and will treat you differently depending on your choices.</li><li><strong>Gather Your <a title="Genres > Party [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></strong> – You won’t be alone on these shores. Meet and recruit a diverse cast of characters, learn their stories, face their demons together and help them grow, or use them for your own gain and discard them as fits your schemes. Who knows, maybe you will even find your true love!</li><li><strong>Master Technology or Magic</strong> – Evolve your character as you see fit using a detailed progression system with 6 character classes and 12 subclasses. Will you master the secrets of Magic to incinerate enemies as a Hellfire occultist, curse them with mystical Voodoo abilities, or assist your allies as a Celestial sage? Or will you rather cast aside the obsolete ways and become a Steampunk mechanic, Dieselpunk engineer or Teslapunk scientist, and turn your character into a walking steam-powered fortress?</li><li><strong>Fight for Your Right</strong> – Command your party in turn-based tactical battles. Fight head-on and brute-force your way through encounters or observe and analyze each situation and come up with cunning strategies to conquer even seemingly overwhelming odds. There’s a plethora of skills, spells, <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> recipes and consumables at your disposal to turn the tide of battle in your favor.</li><li><strong>Manifest Your Destiny</strong> – Make a name for yourself, influence countless lives for better or worse, and watch the consequences of your choices unfold. You may start out as only a poor immigrant, but soon your exploits will fill the front pages of newspapers and the events you set in motion will change the fate of the New World forever.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="New Arc Line | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anrIQ4K6QXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <blockquote><p>The ground-breaking experience from legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, <em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> also features the acting and voice talents led by a star-studded cast including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges, Mads Mikkelsen, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsay Wagner.</p><p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic “Death Stranding” event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</p><p><em>Director’s Cut</em> is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
