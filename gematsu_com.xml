A final major content update for the Early Access build featuring <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> Sharing and various improvements is planned for this spring. <span id="more-1020281"></span></p><p><em>Enshrouded</em> first launched in Early Access for PC on January 24, 2024.</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Roadmap Goes Ever On and On</strong></p><p>On their development adventure, Keen Games has learned that the road is rarely as straightforward as a map suggests. However, any map is better than none, so the team has shared the first look at the evolving roadmap guiding them out of <em>Enshrouded</em>’s Early Access today. It includes the major content update scheduled for Q2 2026—the eighth overall—which will feature a wealth of gameplay improvements, including balancing, further combat improvements, polishing, and performance optimization. <em>Enshrouded</em> developers also confirm that the first iteration of Adventure Sharing, another highly-requested feature by the community, will be implemented in this update: allowing players to easily explore the bases of their fellow Flameborn.</p><p><em>—Roadmap</em></p><!-- AD: content -->

The breakout success of the game’s Early Access launch has allowed the team to execute and expand on <em>Enshrouded</em>’s original concept, making the second half of 2026 the ideal spot to realize the team’s vision. 1.0 Launch will not be the final destination, rather a new chapter for further development—improvements, additional content, and more. Without the support of over five million players, the journey would not have been possible. The team is again humbled and expresses their immense gratitude to the many Flameborn who have fanned the flames and stoked the fires through playing Enshrouded, providing feedback, and being a part of the community, also sharing some of the impressive gameplay stats they have acquired:</p><p>Before we fix our gazes too far down the road, the team shares details of a patch to be released tomorrow that includes the following improvements and fixes:</p><ul><li>Combat tweaks continue, modifying damage number visibility, blocking and parry animations / telegraphy, projectile spells / attack improvements in accuracy, and their related displays.</li><li>New vanity armor set: talk to the Huntress.</li><li>Randomly exploding barrels placed will explode less randomly (after applying the patch, if it does explode, know that it was probably your fault).</li><li>Fixed a lot of bugs, which should improve stability and performance.</li><li>Full patch notes will be shared on Steam when the patch is available.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new developer diary below.</p><h2><span>Road to Release</span></h2><p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Road to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/enshrouded-launches-this-fall-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
