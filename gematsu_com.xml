The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p><p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,612 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p><p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p><p>The game is so close to being done—we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Finalizing design, art, and sound.</li><li>Overall game balancing.</li><li>Implementing localization.</li><li>Eating cheese.</li><li>Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</li></ul><p>Thank you for your understanding and patience.</p><p>Sincerely,<br>The Yacht Club Games Crew</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/mina-the-hollower-delayed-to-unannounced-date]]></content:encoded>
