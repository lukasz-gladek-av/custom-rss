In fact, the bouts are staged by Ron Stein, the boxing guru who choreographed the fight scenes in Raging Bull and the Rocky films. Close-ups, point of view shots and handheld camera bring the intensity of the boxing scene right in your face!</p><p>Rebuilt from the ground up, <em>Prize Fighter</em> has been enhanced with 4K video along with numerous improvements and new features!</p><p>So pull on your gloves and get ready for tonight’s main event.
