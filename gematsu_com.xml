    <p><span>Plus major updates to Tetris Time Warp.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Digital Eclipse [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/digital-eclipse">Digital Eclipse</a> have released the biggest free update for <em><a title="Games > Tetris Forever [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tetris-forever">Tetris Forever</a></em> yet, which includes major updates for <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> and adds new classic MS-DOS games <em>Super Tetris</em> and <em>Tetris</em> version 3.12 by AcademySoft. <span id="more-946775"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features of the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> Update</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Blast Off to Level 30</strong> – The single-player modes in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which previously topped out at Level 15, now go all the way to Level 30! Can you handle even higher speeds of play? Starting at Level 20, the Time Warp Tetrimino piece will no longer feature the golden-colored Tetrimino, so you won’t be able to create Matrix-clearing cascades. And starting on Level 28, the lockdown speed of Tetriminos will greatly increase.</li><li><strong>Time Warp Shield</strong> – In <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, the Time Warp Tetriminos now have a new power – Shield! <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r a line including a Time Warp Tetrimino while the Shield design is showing, and you’ll earn a Shield that will stop other players from sending you into a Time Warp. It disappears after being used once.</li><li><strong>1989 Mode Upgrades</strong> – Enjoy playing <em>Tetris</em> with black-and-white graphics and <a title="Companies > chiptune" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/chiptune">chiptune</a> sounds? 1989 Mode, a single-player mode found within <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, now has a variety of fixes and new options. You can choose to turn off “Modern Gameplay” and experience more historically accurate gameplay. You can also optionally choose to play the game with 18 rows in the Matrix, as opposed to the modern-day setting of 20 rows.</li><li><strong>Take the 40-Line Challenge</strong> – Celebrate <em>Tetris</em>‘ 40th anniversary by trying to clear 40 lines as quickly as you can. Playable in both Modern and 1989 modes.</li><li><strong>Options, Options, Options</strong> – A vastly expanded Options menu lets you customize the visuals, sounds, and gameplay in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> to your liking. Turn individual graphic effects on or off, and tweak your gameplay with new options like the Initial Hold and Initial Rotation systems, Diagonals, and more.</li></ul><p>Many other bug fixes, tweaks, and minor changes to all modes to improve the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> experience.</p><p><strong>New MS-DOS Games Added to <em>Tetris Forever</em></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong><em>Super Tetris</em></strong> – Released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1991, this was an early attempt at creating a “sequel” to <em>Tetris</em>. The gameplay is quite different — the Matrix is half-full of garbage when a game begins, and players can earn and use Bombs to clear out the spaces and find power-ups buried in the garbage. It includes Cooperative and Competitive multiplayer modes, in which two players play in the same Matrix!</li><li><strong><em>Tetris</em> (AcademySoft) v. 3.12</strong> – A historically important inclusion, this is the final version of <em>Tetris</em> created within the Soviet Union in the Academy of Sciences, ported from Alexey Pajitnov’s original Pascal code by Vadim Gerasimov. Dating to 1988, it is notable for its inclusion of Phantom mode, in which all O-Tetriminos (square-shaped pieces) are invisible!</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Updates</strong></p><ul><li>The gameplay behaviors in the recreation of the Electronika 60 version of <em>Tetris</em> have been updated to be even more historically accurate to the original version.</li><li>Now includes language support for Korean and Traditional Chinese.</li><li>Many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements have been made to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,751 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,469 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A demo is available now as part of Steam Next Fest: February 2025 Edition. <span id="more-946761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446600/Dark_Deity_2/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em><a title="Games > Dark Deity [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dark-deity">Dark Deity</a></em> is back! A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p><p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p><p>Put simply, <em>Dark Deity II</em> is about playing your way, all the way.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Strategize and Prevail</strong></p><p>Turn-based tactical combat is at the heart of <em>Dark Deity II</em>. Your 20 heroes have access to 45 branching classes, each with its own powerful abilities, passive effects, and its own tactical niche…</p><p>…that’s until you start experimenting with skills, abilities, and gear that can completely change the way a unit performs in the field and upend your tactics in a good way..</p><p>Heroes will bond as they fight seemingly impossible odds. Hardship forges the strongest bonds… but can also destroy friendships and wreak havoc. Will you be able to walk the line between the two?</p><p><strong>Make Your Decisions Wisely</strong></p><p>A desperate defense against an overwhelming foe. A land in the grasp of war fever, panic, and factional strife. A traitor around every corner. To have a chance at winning the war, you’ll need to make some difficult choices.</p><p>Verroa is torn apart by factions, and many of these factions are fractured in turn. Decide who to support and who to throw to the wolves—but weigh each option carefully. After all, your choices may drastically change the coming battles…</p><p>Every choice can fundamentally change the way you play the game. No two playthroughs are the same and what goes right in one game can go terribly wrong in the other.</p><p><strong>Twist the Threads of Destiny</strong></p><p>No playthroughs are going to be the same, but you can push <em>Dark Deity II</em> even further. Inspired by roguelites, we created the Twisted Destiny mode, allowing you to play through a shortened version of the campaign, featuring a randomized team on every playthrough, a host of new levels and modified existing ones, and unlock rewards for future playthroughs—which can completely change the way you play them!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dark Deity 2 Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqhrob2ruCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
