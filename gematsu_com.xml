    <p><span>Introducing a new boss and major quality of life updates.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Arc Games [101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arc-games">Arc Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Heart Machine [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/heart-machine">Heart Machine</a> will release the “Buried Below” update for the Early Access version of <a title="Genres > Open-World [618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > Co-Op [254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelite [240 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite game</a> <em><a title="Games > Hyper Light Breaker [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a></em> on April 29, the companies announced. <span id="more-960765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Arc Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p><p>On the content front, Buried Below will bring a new Breaker, “Rondo”—a Breaker who comes from the same region as the recently-debuted Breaker, Ravona, and has a new SyCom with two SyCom perks—a new Crown, “Maw”—the biggest and most menacing Crown yet, two new melee weapons and new environments to explore, including caves. For the new Crown, Early Access players have seen glimpses of her in a couple of ways—as she’s shown as a Crown that’s possible to fight when readying up to enter the Overgrowth and players have entered her arena in the hostile crystalscape of the Jeweled Spire. The Heart Machine team’s been working hard on getting Maw ready, and they’re thrilled the time has come for players to face her in just a few days!</p><p><strong>Change in Run Structure</strong></p><p>Since Early Access launch, the Heart Machine has taken to heart all of the player feedback they’ve received across the board. Inspired by player feedback, the upcoming update will introduce the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game’s run structure, as players will now have one life for each run and when they die they will lose items in their inventory, and the Overgrowth will reset. This change was made to balance the game around a more traditional roguelike experience, turning each run into a more consistent and rewarding “zero to hero” adventure than before. This change also allows the Heart Machine to better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into, but harder to master, and addresses much of the feedback the team has received from players since Early Access launch.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This shift in run structure will introduce a few gameplay loops and progression changes to make runs easier, better and ultimately more enjoyable for all players, including veterans and newcomers alike, than before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_960766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Extraction</strong> – More Options for Players: Instead of only one way to leave the Overgrowth (via the Telepad), players will be able to extract at any Shrine in the Overgrowth and there’ll be no waves of enemies to defeat like before. This change will make it so players can extract more often, making the game easier as a result which was one of the main requests from players to change the game’s difficulty.</li><li><strong>SyComs</strong> – Follows a Class-Like System, More Loadout Potential: Character customization has been redesigned giving each Breaker one assigned SyCom with fixed stats, and players have the option to equip a perk to the SyCom that gives the Breaker a new passive ability. For instance, Rondo’s SyCom has an equippable perk called “Bladedancer” that increases Rondo’s damage and attack speed. Players can develop their SyCom stats further at Shrines in the Overgrowth with extended upgrades unlocked through meta progression. This change, inspired by player feedback, will make it so each Breaker is similar to a “class” making each Breaker feel different from one another, and make it so players can come up with distinct builds per Breaker.</li><li><strong>Inventory and Vendors</strong> – More Streamlined: The Vault system will be changed as when you die, the inventory in your Vault will no longer carry over between runs except for Golden Rations, the main meta progression currency in the game. This will allow players to focus solely on acquiring new gear during their runs instead of having to focus on managing their inventory so often like before. Additionally, vendors in the Overgrowth and Cursed Outpost will also have new roles, with Bright Blood and Materials now used for purchases and upgrades. While gear sales have been removed from hub vendors, players can still use them to enhance equipped items.</li></ul><p><strong>Improved Onboarding</strong></p><p>The second major addition in the upcoming patch is a brand-new onboarding tutorial that launches automatically the first time players start the game after the update, regardless of save status. This guided experience introduces core mechanics through a structured level that leads to the Cursed Outpost hub. From there, players will gain access to a dedicated space for learning and practicing advanced combat techniques such as dash attacks and parries. Designed to align with the game’s reworked structure and expanded mechanics, this revamped introduction provides a smooth and informative entry point for both new and returning players.</p></blockquote><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
