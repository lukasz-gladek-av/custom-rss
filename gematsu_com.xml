In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper attempted to put his other self away, but now Eminem recruits the legendary assassin Agent 47 to put his past away permanently. In a surreal new mission crafted by Eminem in collaboration with IO Interactive and creative director / producer Paul Rosenberg, the level is packed with dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s unhinged reality. Operatives find themselves in a medical facility in Hokkaido that has been twisted into the Popsomp Hills Asylum. Agent 47 will have to track Slim Shady across multiple areas, such as his broadcasting studio, to take him out without being detected. There are abundant Eminem references in the mission from throughout the rapper’s discography, such as a poisoned plate of the iconic Mom’s Spaghetti and a performance of “Houdini.”</p><p><strong>The Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Live Updates, Free for <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em>&nbsp;Players</strong></p><p>A new roadmap will start with the Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady set to bring new content to players, in addition to the new Elusive Target. Players will be able to face two new challenges, two new Featured Contracts batches, as well as three returning Elusive Targets, including The Splitter featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and two returning events: Holiday Hoarders and Hokkaido Snow Festival. Two new Twitch Drops will be available to redeem, with the Bomb-Ass Dynamite, and the Solstice Suit, which can be earned by watching thirty minutes of <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em> on Twitch during specific time periods.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
