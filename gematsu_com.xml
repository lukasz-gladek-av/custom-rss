The development team is excited to announce that <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer</em> is now ready for its full release.

Your voices have been instrumental in shaping the game, and we are deeply grateful for your support.</p><p><strong>Full Release Details</strong></p><ul><li>Release date: September 25, 2025 (JST)</li><li>SRP: $49.99 USD / 6,600 JPY</li><li>Platform: Steam</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>What’s New in the Official Full Release</strong></p><ul><li>Addition of new car models and car parts</li><li>Addition of a new chapter and new rivals</li><li>Game balancing and adjustments based on feedback from players</li></ul><p>We would also like to provide some feature updates.</p><p>We have decided to postpone the implementation of the “Replay Feature” and prioritize additional game volume such as additional story content. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to this feature. We will do our best to add the feature, polished and ready in future game updates.</p><p>After careful consideration, we have also decided not to implement “Steam Record Ranking” due to insufficient cheat prevention measures.
