Immerse yourself in a hand-animated, survivor-like experience that blends beat-driven combat with a unique 12-slot inventory system, allowing for near-infinite demonic builds.</p><p>You start as a washed-up musician, stumbling across a crossroads when a hooded figure approaches and asks for your guitar. As they tune it, they ask if you still want to play a gig and hand you a contract. The moment you sign it, you’re dragged to hell because the cloaked figure was none other than the Devil himself, and you’ve just agreed to play for him.</p><p>Now, trapped in the underworld, you must carve out your legend by jamming to the music while fending off endless hordes of fanatical groupies, angry mobs, and rival musicians. Your ultimate goal? To defeat the greatest metal singer of all time, Death, and claim your place as an immortal, legendary musician!</p><!-- AD: content -->
