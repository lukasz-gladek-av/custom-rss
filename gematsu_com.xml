It will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,398 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3872810/Mythic_Yi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2026 with English, French, German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese language support. <span id="more-1023223"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Equalizer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Mythic Yi</em> is a retro pixel-style turn-based RPG set in the primordial era when ten suns scorched the earth and chaos reigned. You will play as Yi, leading companions and wielding the Heaven-Shaking Bow and Cloud-Piercing Arrows on a grand journey to slay six ferocious beasts and save humanity.</p><p>This title is a deep adaptation of the famous Chinese myth “Yi Shoots Down Nine Suns,” presenting a grand tale that transcends traditional imagination. In a primeval era where ten suns scorch the sky and the world teeters on collapse, you will play as the celestial archer Yi. Armed with the Heaven-Shaking Bow and Cloud-Piercing Arrows, you will battle to save all living beings. Yet, this journey is far more than just shooting down the suns—Chang’e’s farewell, Jingwei’s obsession, the schemes woven by the gods… all intertwine with hidden conspiracies and profound emotions. In this world where pixel art converges with ancient myth, many more secrets await discovery.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1023214"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Pixel Epic, Crafted Frame by Frame</strong> – The game employs an HD-2D high-definition pixel art style reminiscent of <a title="Games > Octopath Traveler [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, using meticulous lighting, shadows, and pixel brushstrokes to recreate the majesty and desolation of the primeval age. Each frame unfolds like an ancient scroll, immersing players in an epic journey woven from vision and imagination.</li><li><strong>Ever-Changing Strategic Turn-Based Combat</strong> – The turn-based combat system integrates strategic mechanics such as the Five Elements cycle, dynamic celestial phenomena, and diverse archery skill combinations. Your choices in weapon loadouts, skill timing, and <a title="Genres > Action [3,357 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> order will directly influence the tide of battle. Every encounter is not only a test of strength but also a challenge to your judgment and tactical planning.</li><li><strong>A Myth Retold, Penned by You</strong> – Based on a deep adaptation of ancient Chinese mythology, the game offers multi-branch narratives and fate-altering choices. As the god Yi, you will lead human companions, bearing the Heaven-Shaking Bow and Cloud-Piercing Arrows on a majestic quest to vanquish six great fiendish beasts and save the world. Gods like Fuxi, Nuwa, and Dijun are no longer just legendary symbols—they may become your allies or stand as your foes. Each choice you make will alter their destinies and determine the course of the myth you write.</li><li><strong>The Developers’ Heart: A Return to Classics</strong> – <em>Mythic Yi</em> is a collaborative creation by multiple developers who have been part of the game industry since the 1990s. Having witnessed the industry’s evolution, they have chosen to reunite and return to classic gameplay and a craftsman’s spirit. By fusing a modern HD pixel aesthetic with the core of ancient mythology, they have crafted a sincere tribute to all <a title="Genres > RPG [17,999 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> enthusiasts.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
