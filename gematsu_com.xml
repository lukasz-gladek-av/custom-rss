            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/doom-the-dark-ages-cosmic-realm-reveal-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Here are the latest details, via id Software game director Hugo Martin on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/25/revealing-cosmic-realm-gameplay-from-doom-the-dark-ages-out-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><div><p>If you’ve been following along, you already know that <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is a premium single-player campaign featuring three core pillars of engagement: story, combat, and exploration. I’m guessing you’re reading this because you want to hear something new, something about the game no one else has heard about. Well, I’ve got a good one for you.</p><p>We think <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is the best <em>DOOM</em> game we’ve ever made (but that’ll be for you to decide). We gave this everything we had, left no feature unpolished: we have 22 levels of incredible first-person shooter single-player combat; tons of gameplay innovations like the Shield Saw, flail, and new crazy guns; and an awesome roller coaster ride of an <a title="Genres > Action [2,697 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> story to carry you through to the finish.</p><p>AND—we have huge worlds for you to explore.</p><p>One of them is totally unique for a <em>DOOM</em> game, a space we’ve never been to but a world we’ve wanted to incorporate into the <em>DOOM</em> universe for a while: the Cosmic Realm. You will bear witness to the cyclopean architecture of this Lovecraftian dimension as you explore its darkest secrets and battle its most insane enemies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>An unholy union between Hell and the Cosmic Realm has been formed. You’re going to have to experience the story to find out why—but this partnership has given birth to a new host of adversaries for the Slayer to confront.</p><p>Enemies like the Cosmic Baron. A twin-bladed brute, he attacks with relentless pressure, and at range he releases a flurry of psionic attacks that can block your projectiles and rip through your precious health. But fear not, because embedded in his attacks are parry windows that a skilled Doom Slayer should be able to exploit, should he or she be brave enough to stand and fight him.</p><p>All the strongest foes in <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> require this kind of aggression. You’ll weave your way through a maze of projectiles, just like in classic Doom, to then go toe-to-toe with the biggest demons we’ve ever created.</p><p>After you’ve dispatched the Cosmic Baron, be careful, because rising above the dark horizon you’ll find the powerful Cacodemon, a hybrid between the two dimensions and newly designed for this game. This floating mass of telepathic terror will immobilize you with his advanced shield attacks and cripple you with his tentacle strikes, should you allow him to get close.</p><p>But—you can counter these enemies’ assaults with a new weapon, an ancient tool from dimensions beyond our own: the Reaver Chainshot, a brutal ballistic iron mace of death.</p><p>Fire it quickly to unleash a light attack to a single foe, or hold down the trigger to charge its Chaos Sphere and unleash vicious long-range melee strikes, turning your enemies’ insides into demonic pulp. This weapon is unlike anything we’ve ever had in an id game; it brings the <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em>‘ fantastic melee combat to a whole new merciless level of bone-breaking destruction. The sound, the design, the visuals, this weapon is amazing and you’re gonna love using it in battle.</p><p>There are so many more secrets to reveal and legends to forge here in this new world we’ve crafted for you. I think you’ll find your time in the Cosmic Realm to be full of intrigue and bloody, bone-crunching mayhem. And it will look amazing on your PlayStation 5, featuring cutting-edge, ludicrous mode graphics powered by the all-new idTech 8.</p><p>The innovations in this latest version of idTech allow us to have more content visible on-screen than ever before—bigger spaces with longer views; more enemies to fight; more destruction; better feedback; a better overall gaming experience. We have fully dynamic lighting powered through raytracing, which has allowed us to iterate faster during development and empowered our team to make better art more efficiently. idTech 8 is a purpose-built engine with performance that’s buttery-smooth at 60 frames per second on <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,454 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>—this game will play every bit as good as it looks.</p><p>And there’s plenty more to talk about, but we wanted to give Sony fans something special as we head into launch. We cannot wait to share this experience with you. It is the biggest and most complete, epic game we have ever made at id and it plays fantastic on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro. There will be more to explore, weapons and abilities to unlock, and demons to crush in <em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> when it releases.</p></div><p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/doom-the-dark-ages/9ph9x0760b0t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a> on May 15.

    <p><span>Run an amusement park in Fontaine.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Paralogism,” will launch on May 7, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-961236"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update features a new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, leading players to Mondstadt where an unexpected storm brews. Meanwhile, a new amusement park opens its doors in Fontaine, challenging players to manage its operations with both wisdom and courage. Two new characters will also join the adventure: Escoffier, the former chef of Hotel Debord who can whip up delicious dishes with ease, and Ifa, a seasoned sauro-vet who fights alongside his saurian companion, Cacucu.</p><p>In the latest Archon Quest Interlude, players’ joyous return to Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival takes a sharp turn for the worse as an unexpected trial places Albedo in the crosshairs of all. Travelers will find themselves thrown into an investigation and more alongside Venti, familiar faces from the Knights of Favonius, new allies like Dahlia, as well as the Hexenzirkel’s very own Lady Alice.</p><p>As danger looms beyond the courtroom, signs of a greater threat begin to emerge with monsters invading the city. In a key negotiation with Lady Alice, Travelers must undergo a magical trial to secure her support and defend Mondstadt from the encroaching darkness. The mage’s trial arrives as a new Weekly Boss Challenge, unfolding in a dramatic battle upon a mystical chessboard. Face the King and Queen, uncover the secrets of the board, and prevail against this onslaught of powerful foes!</p><p>A brand-new management gameplay event is coming to Fontaine: The Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, starring Navia alongside familiar faces from Fontaine and Natlan as you work together to run an amusement park. Through managing three main attractions—Eclectic Escapades, Movie Masterpieces, and Mellow Manor—players can grow their park by upgrading facilities and improving Service Value by recruiting and training employees. Along the way, helpful “Friendly Encounters” and even a local chef may offer valuable management techniques or buffs. Clever use of Action Points during each business cycle is key to maximizing revenue and unlocking Performance Rewards, including the exclusive 4-star bow, Sequence of Solitude.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>But Fontaine is home to more surprises yet! Players will soon cross paths with Escoffier, a new 5-star Cryo polearm wielder and the former head chef of the famous Hotel Debord. Her combat style blends culinary flair with elemental power. Escoffier’s Elemental Skill allows her to summon the All-Spectrum Multi-Use <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a> Mek, which can either stay in place to absorb Elemental Attacks and prepare food items, or follow the active character to serve up continuous blasts of Cryo DMG. Beyond dishing out damage, Escoffier also brings reliable support to the table. Her Elemental Burst heals allies, and both her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst reduce enemies’ Hydro and Cryo RES, an effect that strengthens with more Hydro or Cryo teammates.</p><p>Another new playable character is a familiar face from Natlan: Ifa, a new 4-star Anemo catalyst user from the Flower-Feather Clan who soars into battle with his Qucusaurus companion, Cacucu. This skilled sauro-vet can rain Tonicshots on his foes while healing teammates, and summon a wind current that pulls in enemies to control the battlefield. While in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Ifa boosts Swirl and Electro-Charged DMG based on the party’s Nightsoul Points. With his sharp medical instincts, Ifa can also automatically heal the active character when their HP falls below a certain threshold, ensuring his team stays healthy and strong in the heat of battle.</p><p>In Version 5.6’s Event Wishes, Escoffier, Navia, and Ifa will be part of the first phase, followed by Kinich and Raiden Shogun in the latter. Meanwhile, this version will bring back the Chronicled Wish, this time featuring various 5-star characters from Inazuma.</p><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 5.6 will lead to another chapter of the main story, and let players run an amusement park starting from May 7. </p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.
