Play as Vesper, a member of the Stalkers, and traverse the ruined world of Medhram on a mission to save humanity from a deadly cycle of annihilation. Endure nightmarish overworlds, slash through horrific dungeons, face brutal bosses, and wield an arsenal of powers in a relentless struggle against the Night itself.</p><p>It is the 9th Age of humanity. The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A group of humans, calling themselves “The Stalkers,” discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><p>Humanity found the “Seal of Night,” an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage in Fast-Paced Dynamic Combat</strong> – Dash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers.

Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.</li><li><strong>Discover the Dark World of Medhram</strong> – Explore Medhram in a combination of <a title="Genres > Action [3,395 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [2,881 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and dark fantasy lore.
