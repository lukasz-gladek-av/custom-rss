            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Journey Into Dreams Shaped by Point Cloud Technology</strong></p><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is a third-person exploration action game built around the philosophical theme: No Creation Without Destruction. Unlike traditional <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">third-person shooter games</a> where shooting destroys objects, here, shooting materializes and creates from an otherwise abstract, fragmented world.</p><p>The game’s standout feature is its use of point cloud rendering, where space is visualized as a collection of floating particles. On PlayStation VR2, this technique truly shines, enveloping the player in a dreamlike world where your body feels as though it’s dissolving into the environment. The result is a mysterious and deeply immersive sensation, like traveling within a dream itself. Thanks to VR, players can feel that they physically exist within these worlds made up of nothing but particles.</p><p><strong>A <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious Story of the Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the heart of <em>Dreams of Another</em> is a surreal journey through a dream world, led by two characters, The Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier. But this world isn’t just inhabited by people: trees swaying in the wind, lonely doors, softly glowing streetlights, and all sorts of objects come alive with humorous dialogue that casts a quirky light on the questions of human society. Through <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>, they feel as though they’re right there in front of you, drawing you even more deeply in.</p><p><strong>Seamlessly Switch Between First and Third-Person Perspectives</strong></p><p>In the PlayStation VR2 version, players can switch between the third-person perspective used in the <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> version and a special virtual reality-only first-person mode. The third-person view emphasizes the game’s concept and storytelling, allowing players to watch the narrative unfold while seeing their character. In contrast, the first-person mode offers heightened immersion, placing the world of point clouds directly in front of your eyes and allowing for close-up inspection of every detail.</p><p>We recommend using the DualSense controller for third-person mode and the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers for first-person mode. Either way, you’ll experience the shimmering, particle-built dream as if you were truly inside it.</p><p><strong>Eye-Tracking Camera Control in Third-Person View</strong></p><p>Third-person mode takes advantage of eye-tracking, allowing players to shoot simply by looking in a direction. This keeps the intuitive feel of the standard PlayStation 5 version while making gameplay even faster and more fluid. Both the regular and VR versions use haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for a uniquely Dreams of Another experience to further deepen the immersion.</p><p><strong>A Variety of Weapons and Quirky Items</strong></p><p>As players traverse the dreamlike landscape built of point clouds, they’ll encounter entities called Auras. These require a variety of weapons such as submachine guns , grenades and rocket launchers to overcome and these are unlocked as you play through. The rocket launcher, in particular, offers a thrilling experience as its immense power scatters wide areas of point clouds, instantly materializing the impact zone.</p><p>Grenades, on the other hand, offer a tense and strategic gameplay experience as players must carefully time their explosions to hit the Auras. VR amplifies the tension and impact of Aura encounters in a different way again, making them feel even more direct and thrilling. You’ll also discover curious items likeSomeone’s wedding ring or A blown fuse that has served its purpose, adding another layer of exploration and wonder to the game.</p></div><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is due out for PlayStation 5 with PlayStation VR2 support and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561230/Dreams_of_Another/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/dreams-of-another-playstation-vr2-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
