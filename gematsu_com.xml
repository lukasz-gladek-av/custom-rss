    <p><span>A look at some of the game's Aniimo creatures.</span>

As players encounter Aniimo throughout the world, they will discover that Aniimo behave differently when faced with new environments and weather; can be peaceful, provocative, or protective; live in groups or roam by themselves; and other distinguishing factors and behaviors.</p><p>A number of Aniimo took the stage in today’s fresh look at the game to give players an idea of the type of interactions these colorful creatures may have with their environment, as well as with other Aniimo:</p><ul><li><strong>Stellarys</strong> – An evolution of Celestis that can only occur on rainy days, Stellarys uses water to defend and attack and travels alone across Idyll, in stark contrast to Celestis. Because a Celestis that is already owned by a Pathfinder will no longer evolve into Stellarys when in rainy weather, players who want to add a Stellarys to their roster must find and capture one in the wild.</li><li><strong>Helgon and Helmut</strong> – Helgons can exploit Helmuts’ weaknesses in the wild, provoking them to evolve in one of two ways. Most often, Helmut will evolve into Rookguard, which gives them the ability to transform into a metal sphere, thus protecting themselves from Helgon. However, in some rare cases, the bravest Helmuts may instead evolve into Pawney, allowing them to challenge Infregon, the Helgon’s family boss.</li></ul><p>These interactions and evolutions offer just a sneak peek at the variety on display among the Aniimo, with plenty more for Pathfinders to discover when they explore Idyll for themselves. Players eager to get their hands on <em>Aniimo</em> to do so can pre-register at the <a href="https://aniimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for all the latest updates and a chance to be included in upcoming beta tests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Aniimo</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,981 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/aniimo/9pk8phlcqdf6" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, iOS, and Android in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p>In an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow <a title="Companies > Ancient [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a>s came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most…</p><p>True to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared… but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.</p><p>Take on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes’ command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Characters and Imperial <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [103 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>ion</strong> – Join forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist. The knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.</li><li><strong>Free-Form Scenario</strong> – The game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first—from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your <a title="Genres > Action [3,080 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor’s journey.</li><li><strong>Combat</strong> – The strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic <em>SaGa</em> mechanics like “Glimmers,” where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and “Formations,” which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new “United Attack” feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!</li><li><strong>Graphics</strong> – The original 2D pixel <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.</li><li><strong>Difficulty Settings</strong> – Select from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). Casual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.</li><li><strong>Music and Voices</strong> – Kenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen. Furthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Xbox Series Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven | Xbox and Windows Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmXQK5_ftX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Xbox/Windows版『ロマンシング サガ2 リベンジオブザセブン』発売トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1qrmLlqa4kc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-now-available-for-xbox-series]]></content:encoded>
