The full version will feature more content, improved quality-of-life features and progression, and polished mechanics based on community feedback. The Early Access version will also initially launch without monetization to focus on refining gameplay. Monetization will be introduced gradually over the course of Early Access.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>After a cataclysmic event, Hunters were created by mankind to safeguard the collection of an extraterrestrial resource crucial to human <a title="Genres > Survival [382 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, known as Starfall.
