It is a unique opportunity to add a new dimension to a world we already know so well.”</p><p>Dotemu CEO Cyrille Imbert added, “As the first original production in our portfolio, <em>Absolum</em> has been given special attention at every stage of its development. Thanks to the game’s lore, art, and narrative development, we are certain it will be transformed into an incredible TV series—one that we would love to watch ourselves! The quality of their work and their involvement in the game’s artistic direction make Supamonks the ideal partner for this ambitious project.”</p><p>Further details were not announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/absolum-animated-series-adaptation-announced]]></content:encoded>
