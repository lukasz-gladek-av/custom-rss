      </p></div><div><p>Anissa and Lucan will be playable characters in three-versus-three tag fighting game <em><a title="Games > Invincible VS [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a></em>, publisher <a title="Companies > Skybound Games [85 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/skybound-games">Skybound Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Quarter Up [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/skybound-games/quarter-up">Quarter Up</a> announced. <span id="more-1021319"></span></p><p>“The Viltrumites have never been a larger part of the <em>Invincible</em> universe, so there’s no way we could leave them out of <em>Invincible VS</em>,” said <em>Invincible</em> co-creator Robert Kirkman in a press release. “Between Season 4 of the show, the events in the Battle Beast comic series and now with what’s to come in our game, 2026 is going to be a huge year for the Viltrumites.”</p><p>Here are their character descriptions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anissa</strong></p><p>Anissa, one of the Viltrum Empire’s most lethal and loyal enforcers, has a strong-headed nature that fuels her relentless drive to conquer civilizations she believes would be better off under the Viltrumites’ order, with little patience for those who disagree. Extremely powerful and fast, even by Viltrumite standards, she will stop at nothing to ensure planets are ready for takeover. In <em>Invincible VS</em>, Anissa is a premier “Striker” fighter who uses her incredible speed and strength to stay close to opponents with  dashing attacks, multi hit strikes, and rushdown combos.</p><p><strong>Lucan</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Keen on the superiority of his species, Lucan is loyal, ruthless and arrogant, justifying his violence through Viltrumite philosophy and law. He despises “impure” Viltrumite hybrids like Invincible and views all other species as weak. With a blunt, callous personality, Lucan lets his impressive physical abilities do most of the talking. As a strong “Grappler” fighter in <em>Invincible VS</em>, he gains leverage through aerial mobility, taking opponents down with devastating throws, hit grabs and low attacks.</p></blockquote><p><em>Invincible VS</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,260 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,620 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,340 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2353060/Invincible_VS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9nf8skdhflmg" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> on April 30.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
