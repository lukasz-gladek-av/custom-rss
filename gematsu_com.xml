We’re incredibly grateful for the positivity and support that you’ve shown over that short time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Unfortunately, the Season 1 launch hasn’t achieved the level of success we needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat.</p><p>We were optimistic about the first week. We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of <em>Spectre</em> and the studio.</p><p>Since the PC launch, we stretched our remaining capital as far as we could, but at this point, we’re out of funding to support the game. This means Mountaintop will be closing its doors at the end of this week.</p><p>We expect to take <em>Spectre</em> offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 launch via the platforms. We’ll be following up with more information on this soon.</p><p>We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and / or an acquisition. In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.</p><p>This is a painful update to share. We love <em>Spectre</em>, and we’re incredibly proud of what we built with this community.</p><p>From the entire team at Mountaintop, I want to thank the <em>Spectre</em> community for all your support these past few years. We’ve loved every minute, and we’re sincerely going to miss you. Special thanks to our incredible investors too, without which <em>Spectre</em> wouldn’t have been possible.</p><p>This has always been a passion project for us, born out of love for this genre. An indie team of insanely talented individuals who came together from around the world to build a game we believed in.</p><p>We wanted to deliver something innovative and original in a crowded genre that would bring friends together around unforgettable moments. We shook up the format, created a fresh art style and universe, and partnered with some of our heroes. All of us knew from the beginning that the odds were against us, but that’s what we signed up for. It was never a surefire bet. We did it anyway.</p><p>We had a few tough stumbles out of the gate when we launched in September. But this team rallied and poured everything into tackling your critical feedback for Season 1. We made major changes and improvements to virtually every area of the game and brought the game to consoles. Even though it wasn’t enough to achieve financial success, this team fought tooth and nail and went down swinging.</p><p>Game development is full of twists, turns, and surprises, and the industry has changed dramatically since we started the project in 2020. Even though we missed the mark this time, we wouldn’t trade the journey for anything.</p><p>That’s all from us. See you out there.</p><p>—Nate Mitchell and the Mountaintop Team</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
