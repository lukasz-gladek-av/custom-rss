In <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</em>, players can experience 1 vs. 1,000 action woven by tradition and evolution.</p><p>In addition, the complete cast of more than 40 officers and numerous battlefields originally featured in the game will be beautifully recreated using Unreal Engine 5, offering peak action and tactical warfare in this thrilling revival. The <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends</em> expansion, which is also included, features additional stories for seven officers, including Lu Bu, Meng Huo, and Yuan Shao, as well as bodyguard customization, new weapons, and four types of challenge modes, providing even more gameplay to enjoy in this newly remastered classic.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

You’re a brilliant but tormented operant on a desperate assignment. Pick up the pieces of your broken network, untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History, and prove yourself on the big stage or blow it all up—again.</p><p><strong>A Spy Like No Other</strong></p><p>Brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed—you play as operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE. Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you’ve been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate. If they don’t go your way (and they won’t), you’ll have to improvise and hope the consequences are ones you can live with.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong> – Play as Hershel—brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to ash. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li><li><strong>Espionage Reinvented</strong> – Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment. Cope with the terror of reality by giving up parts of yourself and try not to lose your mind in the process.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
