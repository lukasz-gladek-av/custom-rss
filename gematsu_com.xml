        <p>“As always, having ZUN-san make a cover of one of my songs is a dream come true… What!? I have to make a song, too!?” said Toby Fox in a press release. “This time I took the original Megalovania and did bone-lengthening surgery on it to transform it into a cover of Necrofantasia. People might call it lazy, but it is pretty cool. … You know, just like Sans or Yukari. So you can’t complain. By the way, this has nothing to do with the song… But personally, I was really concerned about Sans, a male character, showing up in the female-dominated world of <em>Touhou</em>. Therefore, I made him wear girl’s clothing. Thanks everyone. (Hey! That didn’t fix anything!)”</p><p><em>Undertale</em> lead artist Temmie Chang added, “The song was really cool and gave me a lot of energy and a feeling of nostalgia to a time that’s passed, but meant much to me. It was fun to draw for this while listening to it on loop. I’m really happy I was able to draw each of these illustrations. If you were to tell a baby Tem that she’d get to draw something for ZUN one day, I think her heart would’ve stopped. Thank you for the opportunity! The Yukari Sans drawing is my favorite drawing I’ve ever drawn.”</p><p>Watch a new set of videos below.</p><h2><span>Extra Song Pack Vol. 6 Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Extra Song Pack vol.6 Trailer [Touhou Danmaku Kagura Phantasia Lost]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3fumIG8oAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Megalovania of the Empty Corse” by ZUN</span></h2><p><iframe title="ZUN - 空しき骸のメガロヴァニア（Megalovania of the Empty Corse）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtTCbUhNv84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Necrolovania” by Toby Fox</span></h2><p><iframe title="Toby Fox - Necrolovania（ネクロロヴァニア）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOHY-txkW3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
