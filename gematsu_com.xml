        <p>Can you uncover the truth hidden deep within the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em>?</p><p><strong>Single Play: An Extreme <a title="Genres > Stealth [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Challenge</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is also playable single play, but be warned—single play is an ultra-high-difficulty mode where getting caught means instant game over. The game includes many trial-and-error challenges, so in solo play, you’ll need to learn through death and keep progressing.</p><p>(Version 1.0.2.0 introduced extra lives and solo play adjustments for a better experience.)</p><p>Without the ability to perform chained carries, you’ll have to carefully transport your cargo while constantly fearing an enemy ambush, making for an intensely thrilling experience. You’ll need to avoid detection, watch out for traps, and proceed with extra caution. While the gameplay differs significantly from <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, this mode is perfect for players seeking a truly spine-chilling horror experience.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>Explore the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em> and carry the “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters to the elevator.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search “Test Subjects”</strong></p><p>Once you exit the elevator, scour the floor for “TEST-SUBJECT.”</p><p>But beware—traps and dangers are lurking everywhere. Some areas and mechanisms can only be accessed by cooperating with your teammates. It’s best to avoid venturing alone if possible.</p><p>You might also find useful tools left behind in the area. Be sure to check out lockers, shelves, and any other hiding spots for gear. With luck, you may even find some highly advanced equipment.</p><p><strong>Step 2: If They See You, Run or…</strong></p><p>There’s a chance you will encounter unknown enemies during your search.</p><p>They’re attracted to noise, so stay cautious. If you hide quietly, they might pass without noticing you. Adapt to the situation as needed.</p><p>But if you get spotted, run as fast as you can! Throw items you have at them—it might just help you fend them off.</p><p>Even if someone gets taken down, there’s still hope for rescue.</p><p>Your teammate’s location will be displayed on the screen, so act quickly and stay calm. Minimizing casualties will strengthen the team bond.</p><p>But remember: the window for rescue is shrinking by the second.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Carry and Carry and Carry!</strong></p><p>Once you’ve found “TEST-SUBJECT,” carry it to the elevator with all your might.</p><p>Carrying the capsule creates a lot of noise, attracting enemies, so stay vigilant.</p><p>Although a single investigator can’t handle the heavy capsule alone, you can perform a “Connected Carry” system with multiple players to move it faster than the enemies can catch up.</p><p>However, if your teamwork falters, it could mean a one-way ticket to the afterlife.</p><p>Each “TEST-SUBJECT” has a different value.</p><p>We hope the team can retrieve the most valuable “TEST-SUBJECT” possible.</p><p><strong>Then… Deeper into the “UNDERWARD”</strong></p><p>Once you’ve met the recovery quota, proceed with the verification of the “TEST-SUBJECTS.” We will operate the elevator to the next floor, so investigators should close the elevator door and wait inside.</p><p>We take great pride in the investigators who choose to venture deeper into the more dangerous floors.</p><p>…Please note that we do not guarantee the safety of your life on this mission.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>One-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</li><li>Proximity-based voice chat.</li><li>Randomized, labyrinthine underground hospital floors (with some areas that don’t feel like a hospital at all).</li><li>Deadly and seductive nurse monsters that hunt you.</li><li>Vicious hunters that can be unleashed over time.</li><li>Retrieve capsules containing “TEST-SUBJECT.”</li><li>Supply Machine System: Exchange retrieval rewards for randomized items.</li><li>“Connected Carry” system for high-speed carry with multiple players.</li><li>Various useful items that can be carried over to the next floor.</li><li>Total wipeout = all is lost.
