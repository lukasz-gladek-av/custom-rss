    <div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > GungHo Online Entertainment [446 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gungho-online-entertainment">GungHo Online Entertainment</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Supertrick Games [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gungho-online-entertainment/supertrick-games">Supertrick Games</a> have <a href="https://gunghoonline.com/2025/12/03/let-it-die-inferno-roadmap/" target="_blank">announced</a> the post-launch roadmap for <a title="Genres > Roguelite [314 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite</a> <a title="Genres > Survival [489 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em><a title="Games > LET IT DIE: INFERNO [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/let-it-die-inferno">LET IT DIE: INFERNO</a></em>.  <span id="more-1011157"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What’s Coming Next</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hell Gate Threshold</strong> – We’ve added a new mode called Hell Gate Threshold, designed for players who want to experience <em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> without any player-versus-player encounters. This area still includes enemies, hazards, and items just like usual, but you won’t run into other players. You can replay this area as much as you want, but please note: your Body Rank won’t increase while you’re inside. Keep that in mind before you dive in!</li><li><strong>Radar Update</strong> – It will soon be much easier to tell when another player is nearby. Previously, enemies and players appeared the same on the radar, which made it hard to know what you were walking into. With the upcoming update, players will be clearly marked as players, so you’ll always know exactly who you’re dealing with. This feature won’t be available at launch, but it’s actively in development.</li><li><strong>Escape Pods</strong> – We’ve increased the number of Escape Pods and adjusted their placement so players can return once the right conditions are met. The tutorial also wasn’t doing a great job of explaining how the Escape Pod works, so we improved that section to make everything easier to understand.</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong> – We also heard a lot of feedback about motion blur. Many players mentioned that it made things hard to see, so we took that seriously. We’ve improved the overall visual clarity, not just the motion blur, to make everything easier on the eyes and reduce strain. These updates will be ready for release.</li><li><strong>Enemy Behavior</strong> – On the combat side, a number of improvements have been made. Enemy behavior, animations, and spawn patterns were adjusted, and weapon balance, combo flow, and attack range were tuned to match. The goal is to make battles feel more satisfying and to reward players who master the game’s mechanics. Overall, the combat experience should feel smoother, fairer, and a lot more fun.</li></ul><p><strong>Roadmap Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Season Structure</strong> – <em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> will follow a seasonal format, with each season lasting roughly three months. Season 1 will run through February, and Season 2 will begin around March.</li><li><strong>Season Reset</strong> – At the start of each new season, we’ll be implementing a reset. Certain progress will stay intact, such as expanded character slots, storage, and inventory capacity. However, things like collected items, SPLithium-based mastery progress, and other in-run progression will be reset and cleared out once per season.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> <a title="Companies > Enhance [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – The game includes a blueprint-based crafting system, and while we can’t share all the details yet, we are planning a significant upgrade to crafting in Season 2.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
