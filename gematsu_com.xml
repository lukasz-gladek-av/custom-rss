It will arrive in patch 1.5—free for all <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> owners!</p><p>Legends will launch with three mission types. In <a title="Genres > Survival [510 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps. You’ll fight to control territory on each map. While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage. Each map will have its own unique Curses and Blessings. </p><p>In Story, you’ll team up with another player to tackle a series of 12 missions. After completing each set of three Story missions, you’ll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yotei Six. Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</p><p>As for the other members of the Yotei Six, in April we’ll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Ghost of Yotei: Legends</em>, you can play as one of four classes: Samurai, Archer, Mercenary, or Shinobi. While any class can use a katana and ranged weapon, they also each excel in a different one of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>‘s weapon and combat systems, and can each earn their own unique armor cosmetics as you complete feats through gameplay. The Samurai can wield the ōdachi and has access to the widest range of weapon types, the Archer can use the yari (spear) as well as carry an additional ranged weapon, the Mercenary has access to dual katana with a variety of utility-focused abilities, and the Shinobi can use the kusarigama, as well as a suite of <a title="Genres > Stealth [108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>-focused skills. </p><p>Beyond the loot you earn as you level up, you can also earn additional Legendary weapons and gear as you tackle higher difficulty challenges. Of course, Photo Mode will also return so you can set up <a title="Genres > Action [3,385 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> shots with your teammates while you’re making your way to the highest levels. And if you need to unwind between missions, our new Legends lobby will let you practice combat and archery, challenge your friends to a game of Zeni Hajiki, or see if you can set the high score in Bamboo Strike.</p><p>The fan response to Legends was one of the most rewarding parts of launching <a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and we’re so excited to see the mode return for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>; we can’t for you all to dive in!

It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1025979"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Ember Lab:</p><blockquote><p>After releasing <em><a title="Games > Kena: Bridge of Spirits [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a></em>, we took some time to figure out what we wanted to create next. We explored ideas that could capture the heart of what made <em>Kena</em> special while building on everything we’d learned along the way. When we began thinking about returning to her world, we were drawn to the idea of Kena as a more experienced Spirit Guide who could use her skills to help the living, not just those who had passed on.</p><p>In <em>Kena: Scars of Kosmora</em>, Kena is older and renowned as a Spirit Guide. In hopes of finding answers to the affliction she has endured all her life, Kena travels to the mysterious island of Kosmora. Home to distinct cultures and regions, Kosmora is full of buried secrets from a tragic past.</p><p>On Kosmora, Kena is confronted by a powerful spirit that fractures her staff. A spirit guide’s staff is their identity – their tool to help and commune with spirits. Kena’s staff was also keeping her alive. To survive, Kena must accept Kosmora’s forgotten form of Spirit Guiding which uses Alchemy to manipulate the power of the elements.</p><p><a title="Companies > Elementa [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>l spirit companions are a big part of this world. They are charming buddies that travel with you, grow over time, and unlock new powers as your bond deepens. Each spirit is tied to a different element and connected to other spirits that exist throughout the world. We revealed one Spirit so far, but we have only scratched the surface. There’s much more we are saving for later!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t worry though, there will still be plenty of corrupted souls to cleanse. We want players to feel Kena has grown in skill and capability. We’ve added new elemental gameplay to bring strategy and depth when facing the threats of Kosmora. These new combat skills, elemental infusions and use of your Spirit Companions will be key to overcoming challenging encounters and epic boss fights.</p><p>While we’d love to talk to you more about the story you’re going to experience, we’re very conscious of anything remotely spoiler-esque. We’ve put a ton of effort into <a title="Genres > Crafting [49 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the narrative for Scars of Kosmora, and the team is focused on creating an emotional and heartfelt <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,873 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> for returning players of <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em> and those new to Kena’s world.</p><p>We hope you enjoyed what you saw in the trailer. Partnering with PlayStation Studios has empowered us to craft an even larger world – one built with an emphasis on tightly designed regions, deliberate progression, and a strong sense of adventure. We’re super excited to share more in the future and can’t wait for you to get your hands on what we’ve been crafting. The reception for Bridge of Spirits was humbling, and we hope to deliver on what everyone loved about the first game and more. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kena: Scars of Kosmora - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/kena-scars-of-kosmora-announced-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>
