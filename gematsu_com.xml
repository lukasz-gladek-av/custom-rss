An open beta test will run from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a> to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a>. <span id="more-984530"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ About Early Access on October 9</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a new title in development from Chief Rebel, a brand-new studio with industry veterans who’ve worked on major titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em><a title="Games > Diablo IV [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>, the <em>Just Cause</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> series and more. With Fellowship being the first title from the studio, Chief Rebel is thrilled to bring <em>Fellowship</em> into Early Access in under two months, letting players experience this truly unique and challenging yet accessible player-versus-environment dungeon crawling adventure and are involving the community more directly with the creation of the game. The upcoming Early Access launch will mark just the beginning of <em>Fellowship</em>, as this new title will be a constantly evolving adventure with a slew of content that will be added and evolve thanks to player feedback throughout the course of Early Access.</p><p>Those who embark on this adventure from the very beginning of Early Access will be able to experience the core vision of <em>Fellowship</em>: all dungeons, all the time—giving players the <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> they want right from the start. Following Early Access launch, there are plans for optimal cosmetic purchases to be available. However, these items will be purely cosmetic and not affect gameplay. More details on these items will be revealed sometime closer to Early Access launch. For the full 1.0 version of the game, the Chief Rebel team is planning on including more content, systems, and features. The team has several plans in-mind for content and features, however, they will also take feedback from our players to heart and may make adjustments if they hear that there’s something the community really wants to see. <em>Fellowship</em> is planned to be in Early Access for approximately six months, but this can change depending on community feedback—as Chief Rebel will strive to discover what the community wants in Fellowship to help shape it into the best possible game it can be before it enters 1.0 launch next year.</p><p><strong>■ About the Upcoming Open Beta</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The upcoming open beta for <em>Fellowship</em> via Steam will kick off on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">Thursday, September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a> and end on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">Tuesday, September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a>. For the Open Beta, there will be a North America, Europe and Asia server available. This playtest will give players the chance to experience seven heroes (two Tanks, three DPS—including a recently-revealed DPS, Mara, and two Healers) who will be in <em>Fellowship</em>’s diverse roster of heroes, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot along the way. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo back in February, in addition to introducing a new DPS hero, Mara, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding, and an engaging progression system including Weapons, Gems, Talents, <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a>, Legendary items and more. Additionally, the Open Beta will introduce a new dungeon “Urrak Markets,” new gameplay features like cosmetic customization allowing players to change the look of different pieces of armor, new Gear, new Mounts, new visual element improvements and improvements on previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. The Open Beta will allow Chief Rebel to test multiplayer matchmaking improvements they’ve made, and give the team the chance to get one final round of player feedback before <em>Fellowship</em>’s Early Access launch.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_984531"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a multiplayer online dungeon adventure set in an exciting fantasy setting, with endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Players must focus on working together as a team, with an emphasis on skill, cooperation, and strategy to defeat bosses, collect loot, and work together to overcome ever-present challenges. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the “Holy Trinity” and build the ultimate team of tanks, healers and damage dealers to take down hordes of enemies and imposing bosses. Work together with your friends to overcome the greatest challenges, creating unbreakable bonds and memorable moments. Players can also flex their individual skills on the competitive leaderboards that show where you stand in <em>Fellowship</em>. Persevere, overcome and ascend through the top ranks in <em>Fellowship</em>!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gather Your Perfect Team</strong> – Play alongside your friends in teams with 4 Player Co-op Multiplayer in a rich, fantasy world full of challenging enemies and exciting rewards. Swap between a large pool of tank, healer and DPS roles with unique kits to build the perfect balance for your team.</li><li><strong>Endless Scaling Replayability</strong> – Every run will feel like a brand-new challenge with dungeons that will get more difficult as players progress and level up. Players will never out level the game with seasonal updates, dungeon modifiers, new features and rewards that will keep each run fresh and exciting, adding another layer of replayability.</li><li><strong>Unique and Complex Boss Mechanics</strong> – Each boss has unique and varied mechanics, for a fresh experience every run. Enemy skills grow as difficulty increases and additional modifiers continue to challenge players as they grow and improve.</li><li><strong>Rewards, Loot, and Gear Galore</strong> – After each completed dungeon run, players will earn loot to make their characters even more powerful! The tougher the dungeon, the better the rewards.</li><li>Players will find that <em>Fellowship</em>‘s most unique feature that sets it apart is how it streamlines the dungeon running experience and how players can take part in endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Instead of grinding and spending hours to be able to access and go on endgame-like dungeon runs, with <em>Fellowship</em>, players can dive right into these types of dungeon runs from the beginning. Unlike other titles, including <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">MMOs</a>, there’s no barrier of entry at all—whether it’s time commitment-specific or needing to get through a ton of prerequisite content—for being able to jump into endgame dungeons in <em>Fellowship</em>. Both newcomers and seasoned veterans will discover they can get the dungeon experience they want from the start, as they can choose to play Quick Play that offer more casual 10-15-minute dungeon runs or Ranked that offers a more competitive experience with Curses, Ascensions and difficulty scaling that drastically change the dungeon running experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
