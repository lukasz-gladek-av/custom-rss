      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Team NINJA [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/team-ninja">Team NINJA</a> will release a demo for <em><a title="Games > FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</a></em> on March 5, the companies announced. Additionally, a special collaboration with <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill f [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a></em> is planned in the form of free costume downloadable content for each game. <span id="more-1021604"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em>, twin sisters wander into an abandoned village infested with vengeful spirits, and use the Camera Obscura, a device that can capture and seal away the impossible, as their only weapon. This complete remake of the second title in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> franchise introduces new gameplay elements, including a brand-new ending featuring the song “Utsushie”, composed by Tsuki Amano, along with new side stories and new locations to explore.</p><p>During their haunted journey, players will be able to use Broken Spirit Stones to delve into the past of various characters and discover new side stories, expanding the lore of Crimson Butterfly. Players will also explore new locations such as the Umbral Mound, an ominous burial site tightly bound with ropes and hidden within dense bamboo groves, and the candlelit hall of Eikado Temple, with its pair of twin statues tied together by sacred cords.</p><p>The deeper players delve into the mystery of the haunted village, the more danger they encounter. Evil spirits grow more desperate to attack, sprouting wings. In this state, spirits are shrouded in crimson malice, rapidly regenerating health while attacking more frequently and with even greater strength.</p><p>To help defeat the spirits lurking in the shadows, players can use Prayer Beads to enhance the Camera Obscura in battle, increasing the number of focus points and improving the reload speed. Players can also find Reversion Beads as they explore to reset all unlocked upgrades.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021660"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Using the Camera Obscura, players can take new Special Shots to fight vengeful spirits. Equipping different filters applies unique effects to Special Shots, allowing players to adapt their strategy to any situation. For example, the Paraceptual Filter allows players to activate the Special Shot “Blinding,” which temporarily blinds their target, allowing the player to escape. Another filter, the Radiant Filter, allows players to use the Special Shot “Purging,” which sacrifices Mio’s willpower to inflict increased damage.</p><p>﻿The Camera Obscura is more than a spiritual weapon: it can also be used to capture photographs of Twin Dolls scattered across Minakami Village. These dolls modelled after the Twin Maidens are guardians against calamity. Players can purify them by photographing them together in the same frame, finally putting them and the emotions trapped within them to rest. With each set of Twin Dolls purified, more items will unlock in the Point Exchange.</p><p>In addition to these new mechanics, <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> also introduces a new Photo Mode that players can use to capture in-game moments. Players can use frames, stickers, and visual effects to create their own terrifying souvenirs and, maybe, capture an unexpected spirit or two.</p><p>The terrifying gameplay gets even scarier with a newly-announced collaboration with SILENT HILL f, the latest title of the renowned psychological horror franchise SILENT HILL that has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Collaboration costumes will be added as free downloadable content at a later date. More details about this future update will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></blockquote><p><em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,274 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [908 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,359 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3920610" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 12.</p><p><em>Silent Hill f</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/silent-hill-f-714aed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/silent-hill-f/9n5nfrqv2hqq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.
