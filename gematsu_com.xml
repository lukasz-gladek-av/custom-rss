            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled <em>Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.</p><p>Why is <em>Kingmakers</em> being delayed? In short it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</p><p>With <em>Kingmakers</em>, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60 frames per second to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80 percent engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers.</p><p>We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with Al and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore with or without their own personal army of thousands.</p><p>We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in / drop-out and player <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [613 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it.</p><p>So that is what we are doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days.</p><p>Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it.</p><p>We will be presenting a half-hour-long deep dive on <em>Kingmakers</em> gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.</p><p>—Redemption Road Games</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kingmakers-early-access-delayed-to-unannounced-date]]></content:encoded>
