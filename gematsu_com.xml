Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Weapons Live, Lights Out</strong> – <em>Blindfire</em> is an online multiplayer first-person shooter. Set in a shadowy underworld, the ultra-wealthy bet on illicit bloodsports beneath a neon skyline. For contestants lured by the promise of untold riches and unimaginable glory, it’s kill or be killed.</li><li><strong>Every Kill Counts</strong> – Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players. In Bodycount mode, score the most points over five rapid-fire rounds. Be the last person standing when the lights come on and earn your place in the winner’s showcase.</li><li><strong>Danger Lurks in the Dark</strong> – Light is a rarity in close-quarter arenas riddled with traps for intense firefights. Players must decide where and when to fire at the risk of exposing their position. Hone your senses with the room-scanning Echo mechanic to help you navigate the arena and locate your opponents.</li><li><strong>Revenge Under the Blacklights</strong> – When defeated, spectators gain access to the arena’s cutting-edge night vision cameras. Blacklight reveals the vibrant hues of hidden street art and transforms the slick designs of contestants’ outfits. The eliminated spectators can assume control of traps in the arena to influence the outcome of the match and exact revenge.</li><li><strong>Light Them Up</strong> – The pitch-black battlefields of <em>Blindfire</em> turn the first-person shooter genre on its head. Stalk the shadows as the tension builds, then run for cover as the shots start flying in a volley of muzzle flashes. Think you’ve got what it takes to eliminate the competition in <em>Blindfire</em>? Then grab your weapon and LIGHT THEM UP.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Early Access Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="BLINDFIRE - PlayStation Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNgKTcssaR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
