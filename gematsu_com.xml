Players will be able to bring the heat with Mai across all three game modes, including Fighting Ground and Battle Hub, as well as checking her out as the newest <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter in World Tour.</p><p>The dazzling Mai also drops with two Outfits. Outfit 1 is reminiscent of her classic style across SNK’s historic <em>Fatal Fury</em> series while Outfit 2 will be themed around her newest look in the upcoming Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Outfit 2 can be acquired via Fighter Coins or maxing out your bond with her in World Tour.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_938132"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Mai’s moveset uses a variety of familiar and newer techniques during matches to control her opponents with flaming projectiles, divekicks and more, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Kachousen</strong> – Mai throws her fan like a fireball. When used normally, the fan loses to other projectiles and your opponent’s strikes can knock them down. But when you hold down the input, they can no longer be neutralized by strikes. In addition, if the fan hits an opponent, it will pop up and fall down on them for another hit.</li><li><strong>Ryuuenbu</strong> – Spin forward in a fiery blaze for combos or to control space.</li><li><strong>Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Perform a cartwheel and fly towards opponents to elbow them. The <a title="Games > OD [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/od">OD</a> version sends Mai into the air to follow up on the attack or to surprise opponents below.</li><li><strong>Hishou Ryuuenjin</strong> – Mai’s dragon punch, which works as an effective anti-air as she delivers a flying upwards kick bathed in flame.</li><li><strong>Kagerou no Mai </strong>– Mai’s Level 1 Super Art, she sets the immediate vicinity on fire, which can be useful as an anti-air move or combo ender. The move also gives Mai five Flame Stocks which give all of Mai’s special moves and Level 1 and 2 Super Arts special properties.</li><li><strong>Chou Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Mai’s Level 2 Super Art where she rushes forward in a blaze of glory that can get around projectiles.</li><li><strong>Shiranui Ryuu</strong> – Enbu Ada Zakura: Mai’s Level 3 Super Art, she flies like a butterfly and stings like a bee in a series of elegant fan strikes.</li></ul><p>Mai will be ready to spice things up next month for players who own or purchase the Year 2 Character Pass or Year 2 Ultimate Pass, and can also be purchased with Fighter Coins. The wicked M. Bison and easygoing Terry (both available now) will be joined by Mai (February 2025) and Elena (spring 2025) to round out Year 2 of <em>Street Fighter 6.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,647 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,584 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> vis <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the gameplay trailer below.

Time is a resource and with each quest progressing its passage, it is impossible to complete all stories and arcs before the dreadful deadline, making each playthrough unique. We call it a narrative sandbox.”</p><div id="carousel_938125"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is am overview of the game, via Bandai Namco:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is the first chapter of Rebel Wolves’ brand new role-playing saga—a single-player open-world dark fantasy action RPG with a strong focus on story and narrative. Developed on Unreal Engine 5 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>14th century Europe. Bloody conflicts sweep the lands, and the Black Death comes for the survivors. In the wake of the disasters claiming thousands of lives, the decimated human population struggles for survival. It’s a moment of weakness. In Vale Sangora, somewhere in a forgotten corner of the Carpathian Mountains, vampires seize their opportunity to walk out of the shadows, overthrow the feudal lords and claim what they’ve been denied for centuries: freedom, and ultimate power that comes with it. Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Not fully human, not entirely a vampire, you have 30 days and nights to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.</p><p>The freedom in gameplay is reflected in Coen’s very nature as a Dawnwalker. Depending on the time of day, players will have different skills, abilities and storyline outcomes. Players must choose: do they fight for humanity or embrace the cursed powers?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the trailer below.
