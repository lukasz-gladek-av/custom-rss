By partnering with the best developers in the industry we can deliver new games and innovative experiences across all platforms for our fans to enjoy.”</p><p>Resolution Games founder and CEO Tommy Palm added, “With the launch of <em>Demeo</em> back in 2021, we began to grow an incredible relationship with the [<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>] player community. <em>Demeo</em> and <em><a title="Games > Demeo Battles [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demeo-battles">Demeo Battles</a></em> quickly became a game night substitute for Dungeon <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ters who wanted an out-of-campaign way to have fun with their groups, and for [<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>] players to introduce their friends and family to tabletop miniatures games. <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> opens up that appeal even further by adapting the classes, <a title="Genres > Action [2,448 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and lore of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to this system for all new <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and a whole new experience built from the ground up with [<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>] in mind.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Resolution Games:</p><blockquote><p>Assemble your party and get ready to embark on an epic journey in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe! Gather your friends for an unforgettable adventure that will blend classic <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> excitement with fast-paced tactical action.

With cross-platform support for up to four players <a title="Genres > Co-Op [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly, <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> will feature two story-based campaigns at launch with additional campaigns in different <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> settings planned as downloadable content in the future.
