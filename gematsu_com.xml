We’re especially eager to gather feedback on progression, the combat experience, cross-platform performance, and how the experience feels now that it’s more expansive and layered.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>Running from April 30 to May 4, Tech Test 2 gives players across PC and—now for the first time—consoles (PlayStation 5 and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,046 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>) a chance to explore the lethal wilderness of the Rust Belt, battle ARC machines, and scavenge for high-stakes loot in the game’s expansive player-versus-player-versus-environment  sandbox.</p><p>In addition to a range of tweaks and improvements, Tech Test 2 introduces a wider range of ARC enemies, more weapons, gear, and gadgets, much deeper player progression and <a title="Genres > Crafting [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> systems, and a preview of <em>ARC Raiders</em>‘ upcoming Battle Pass. </p><p><em>ARC Raiders</em> blends high-risk surface scavenging with strategic survival and crafting elements underground.
