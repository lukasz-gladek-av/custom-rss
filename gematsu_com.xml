    <p><span>Varesa and Iansan join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Day of the Flame’s Return,” will launch on March 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-950103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Venturing into the southwestern reaches of Natlan, players will meet a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty, and explore the Great Volcano of Tollan, where they may begin their journey towards the sacred city. Meanwhile, Varesa, a new ally, and the long-awaited Iansan will become playable alongside a new Saurian companion, the Tatankasaurus, all to collectively enrich combat and exploration!</p><p>Long revered as a sacred mountain, the Great Volcano of Tollan now extends its fiery embrace to all players who dare to tread its depths— where traces of its rich, layered history lie hidden, where a sacred city built by the Dragonborn slumbers, slowly roused by the restless roiling of magma beneath. Players can enter the Sacred City of Tollan through a special method, and set out to unravel the mystery of the “Flamelord’s Blessing” and the enigma surrounding their Little One.</p><p>On the path to the sacred mountain, players will encounter a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty. The people there are deeply devoted to fitness and love to test their strength in friendly competitions. Nurtured by fertile volcanic soil, the tribe’s harvest is blessed with exceptionally sweet and juicy fruits. However, the volcano, though usually simmering in silence, can occasionally spring to life and spew out showers of falling rocks. When this happens, players can transform into the Tatankasaurus, a new Saurian from the Collective of Plenty, capable of smashing through large chunks of Pulverite and even briefly dashing across water or liquid Phlogiston.</p><p>New Saurians roam this scorching land, as do the Collective of Plenty’s noble warriors. Among them are Varesa and Iansan, who can sprint and perform flying leaps as they traverse Natlan’s terrain.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_950104"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Varesa is a 5-star Electro Catalyst user who uses Plunging Attacks to trigger her Fiery Passion state. While in this state, she deals more Electro DMG, and can access a special Elemental Burst with reduced Energy cost. To quickly enter this state, Varesa can tap her Elemental Skill, then follow up with Normal Attacks to perform swift Plunging Attacks. Additionally, her unique talent helps restore Phlogiston after the party consumes food. As her Tribal Chronicle will reveal, Varesa is only fierce in battle, and leads a daily life almost far too laid-back.</p><p>Known as Varesa’s coach and one of the six heroes of Natlan, Iansan is a 4-star Electro Polearm wielder. She provides powerful support to the party by enhancing the on-field character’s ATK while also healing her allies. Her Elemental Burst increases the on-field character’s ATK even when she is off-field, and her ATK buff scales with the distance that her teammates move. Additionally, when her teammates trigger a Nightsoul Burst, Iansan obtains the Warming Up effect, allowing her to continuously restore HP to the on-field character for a short duration. In the first phase of Version 5.5’s Event Wishes, Varesa and Iansan will debut alongside Xianyun’s rerun, followed by reruns for Xilonen and Venti.</p><p>After a long hiatus, Natlan’s traditional Bloomflower Trials will be making a return. Players will team up with Mavuika, Ifa, and their other Natlan allies to participate in this unique event, and save a brave Saurian afflicted by a rare illness. Moreover, in the “Saurian Treasure Seeker” mini-game, players can also assist a group of baby Saurians in their quest to overcome obstacles and collect shiny treasures. By taking part in the event, players will have the opportunity to invite Ororon for free.</p><p>Version 5.5 also introduces new challenges and system optimizations. A new boss, the Lava Dragon Statue, awaits in the geothermal fissures of the volcano. As for optimizations, the Artifact leveling experience will be enhanced, as upgrading Artifacts defined with Sanctifying Elixirs guarantees at least two upgrades to the defined Minor Affixes.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,048 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,878 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,805 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

The player takes on the role of an adventurer tasked with saving a town plagued by a curse, while exploring dungeons filled with hidden treasures. However, within the dungeons, curses can suddenly befall the player due to enemy attacks, treasure chest traps, or certain locations. Curses are not just a disadvantage—if brought back to town and purified, they can be used to strengthen the player. Players will need to decide how long they can endure the curse as they press forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay system follows the traditional command battle RPG format, with turn-based battles that split the party into a vanguard and rearguard. The player’s party will consist of a variety of classes, with the following five revealed so far: Fighter, Barbarian, Archer, Paladin, and Sorcerer. Additional classes are expected to be revealed in the future.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Gobble</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">Side-Scrolling</a> Action</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Gobble</em> is a side-scrolling action game that originated from Nippon Ichi Software’s annual internal competition, the “Nippon Ichi Project Festival.” The game was conceived by an employee in their second year at Nippon Ichi Software, who is now serving as the project’s development manager. Past contests have resulted in the creation of titles like <em>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary</em>, <em>Yomawari: Night Alone</em>, and <em>The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince</em>.</p><p>The game is set in a world that should have found peace after the defeat of the Demon King. The protagonist, a young boy, encounters a talking “sickle” during a sudden monster attack. The brash sickle and the boy, who is searching for his missing family, form a duo, and a quirky, dark adventure begins.</p><p>The key mechanic in the game is “predation.” By consuming defeated enemies, the sickle can steal their abilities.</p><p>The game stands out with its distinctive use of American comic-style events and cartoon-like animations. Players should also pay attention to the visuals featured throughout the game, during moments like attacking or defeating enemies, or when events occur.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_009.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Kyouran</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2026</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Kyouran_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Kyouran</em> is an action RPG developed by the main staff behind the <em><a title="Series > Disgaea [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series.
