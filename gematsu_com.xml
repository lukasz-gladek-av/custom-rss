As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and <em>King of Meat</em>‘s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.</p><p>All players who purchased <em>King of Meat</em> will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported <em>King of Meat</em> and the wonderful community that formed around it.
