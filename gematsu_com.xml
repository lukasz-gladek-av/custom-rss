        <p>When it was built, Sanzu City was meant to be the future—a self-contained utopia where people could work, live, and raise their kids to build a better world… working for the global megacorp Agradyne.</p><p>But three years ago, something escaped Agradyne’s deepest laboratories. And with it came a flood of <a title="Genres > Horror [579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s: demons seeking human host bodies to possess. Many of them lost control and twisted into grotesque, mutated beasts.</p><p>Agradyne abandoned Sanzu, sealing its survivors in a hellish maze of abandoned skyscrapers.</p><p><strong>The Monsters We Make</strong></p><p>Luca wakes in the ruins of Sanzu. Before the disaster, she was a lonely teenager growing up in this company town. Going to a high school run by a tech company seemed completely normal to her. Now, the only thing keeping her alive is Rhem, a powerful, bitter demon who escaped Agradyne’s clutches. Rhem agreed to possess Luca to save both of their lives. But all Rhem wants is to return home, so Luca has promised to help.</p><p>​<br>As Luca and Rhem search for answers, they learn what it means to take and lose control. They witness disturbing and tragic pairings of humans and demons, each reflecting the way people can bind, manipulate, and break one another.</p><p>They travel tethered together on a journey that will force Luca to confront the horrifying truths hiding behind her city’s friendly corporate face.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Features and Systems</strong></p><p>Luca’s arsenal of improvised melee weapons allows her to explore a variety of combat styles. She starts with simple kitchen knives, but can also beat down demons with a computer mouse, hockey stick…or even a guitar!</p><p>Luca’s trusty kitchen knives are sharp and fast, allowing her to get in close and quickly slice demons before slipping away out of danger.</p><p><video id="video-951092-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/CjDuFDq.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CjDuFDq.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/CjDuFDq.mp4</a></video></p><p>If she keeps up the pressure, she can stagger them, rendering them vulnerable. Dealing directional damage will juggle enemies in the air… and prolong their suffering.</p><p>But what’s Luca to do if a demon slips through her grasp? She can channel Rhem’s power to whip enemies and drag them to her.</p><p><video id="video-951092-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/7aPqLPL.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7aPqLPL.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/7aPqLPL.mp4</a></video></p><p>The whip has many other uses, including swinging through the world, moving heavy objects, or propelling herself towards larger, more dangerous demons.</p><p><video id="video-951092-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/64YgOMc.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/64YgOMc.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/64YgOMc.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Enemies and Combat Encounters </strong></p><p>Demons can possess anything—people, potted plants, vending machines, or even an Agradyne Series LC65 Multi-Function Printer Scanner! Luca must tread carefully because enemies are everywhere and hidden in plain sight. To bring Rhem home, she will have to face the most powerful demons in each district of Sanzu.</p><p><video id="video-951092-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/CVtT3LH.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CVtT3LH.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/CVtT3LH.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Exploration</strong></p><p>Navigate the interconnected districts of Sanzu City. Each area offers unique challenges and atmosphere. See the ruins of Luca’s old neighborhood through her eyes, then lose yourself in dense, vertical skyscrapers and laboratories full of secrets and mutated objects.</p><p><strong>Abilities and Progression</strong></p><p>As Luca and Rhem grow stronger, they unlock new combat, traversal abilities, and weapon modifications. Customize your combat loadout and assign each attack button to a different weapon for a vast possibility of combos.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
