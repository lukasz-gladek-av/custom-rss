Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <em>Darkborn</em> was cancelled, and because of this team‚Äôs loyalty and refusal to quit, <em>Metal: Hellsinger</em> was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</p><p>We had hoped to do something even better this time‚Äî.</p><p>‚Äîthings don‚Äôt always go the way you hope.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting.</p><p>Thanks so much.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shuts-down]]></content:encoded>
