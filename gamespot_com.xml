                <p>In the wake of EA's announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company's expectations</a>, BioWare has announced that it is "changing how we build games" in an effort to hold the company to "the highest quality standards."</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, BioWare GM Gary McKay said "a core team" at BioWare is making the next Mass Effect, while other team members are departing. McKay said BioWare has "worked diligently" in the past months to find new positions for BioWare staffers at other internal EA teams. Whether or not there were layoffs connected to these changes, however, is unknown. The Veilguard game director Corinne Busch has left BioWare.</p><p>"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans. We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>McKay added that, because the next Mass Effect game is so early in development, the studio doesn't "require support from the full studio."</p><p>"Today's news will see BioWare become a more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs. We appreciate your support as we build a new future for BioWare," McKay said.</p><p>EA management said earlier this month that The Veilguard "engaged" 1.5 million players, which was a big miss from the 3 million that EA expected. Whether or not this had anything to do with the structural changes at BioWare is unknown.</p><p>BioWare's track record in the past decade has been checkered. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-wins-goty-at-game-awards/1100-6424005/" data-ref-id="1100-6424005">Dragon Age: Inquisition won Game of the Year</a> in 2014, but 2015 saw the cancellation of BioWare's multiplayer game Shadow Realms. Then in 2017, BioWare released Mass Effect: Andromeda, and many remarked that it failed to live up to the franchise's lofty quality benchmarks. BioWare followed Andromeda up with Anthem, a multiplayer live-service game that faced its own share of issues and criticisms. Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which included remastered versions of the original Mass Effect trilogy, followed in 2021 and was well-regarded.</p><p>As mentioned, BioWare is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-features-several-veterans-on-its-development-team/1100-6485584/" data-ref-id="1100-6485584">now working on the next Mass Effect with a veteran team</a>, but no one should expect it to release anytime soon.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is celebrating the year of the snake with the return of its Lunar Awakening event, and it's making the event even more rewarding than last time around.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by Blizzard, the Lunar Awakening event will be live February 4-18 for both the game's Eternal and Seasonal realms. Like last year's event, Lunar Awakening replaces all of the game's shrines with special Lunar Shrines. These shrines function much the same as their normal counterparts, only with even more powerful effects in addition to their usual ones. Lunar Artillery Shrines, for example, have a chance to blast enemies with a holy bomb in addition to piercing enemies with holy arrows as usual. Whereas Greed shrines typically just grant players more gold for killing monsters, the Lunar Greed Shrine actually makes it so every kill also has a chance to summon a Treasure Goblin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327"></a><figcaption>Players can earn free cosmetics by slaying monsters while under the effects of a Lunar Shrine during the event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lunar Shrine bonus effects are the same as they were during 2024's event, but what is different this time is the amount of bonus XP players gain while under the effects of a shrine. For this year's version, players will enjoy a 100%, multiplicative experience bonus for the duration of the shrine's effects, up from 50% last year. That will make leveling a new character or earning endgame Paragon points even faster (and it's already pretty darn fast to begin with).</p><p dir="ltr">Slaying monsters while under the effect of a Lunar Shrine will earn players the reputation needed to progress through the event's reward track. There are 10 rewards in total to claim, including a mount, weapon appearances, and a Resplendent Spark needed to craft Mythic Uniques. Lunar Awakening-themed items will also be available on Diablo 4's premium cosmetics shop for the duration of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 recently saw the launch of Season 7--where players can equip new supernatural powers to aid them in slaying their foes. Many of the powers found in Season of Witchcraft, like Firebats and Piranhado, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/" data-ref-id="1100-6528778">take inspiration from Diablo 3's Witch Doctor</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's most recent update saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4s-armory-will-be-a-boon-for-eternal-players-and-the-chances-of-a-witch-class/1100-6528885/" data-ref-id="1100-6528885">addition of the Armory to both the Eternal and Seasonal realms</a>, allowing players to save up to five loadouts per character in the name of encouraging more build experimentation. It also brought major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-7-patch-notes-reduce-rune-costs-and-brings-major-spiritborn-balance-changes/1100-6528887/" data-ref-id="1100-6528887">balance changes to Diablo 4's Runewords</a> and substantially nerfed its new expansion-exclusive class, the Spiritborn.</p>

Fans were required to register for tickets and participants were randomly selected. Now that the tickets went out earlier this week, some winners have been putting them up for sale on eBay.</p><p>The issue is that these tickets are non-transferable, meaning that whoever buys it from the reseller won't be able to get into the event.

There's another listing for a Dallas ticket, which is starting at a bid of $40, but has since also been taken down. Some are going for as high as $300, such as a listing for the event in New York.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435493" data-ratio="0.4326750448833" data-width="1114" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435493"></a><figcaption>The tickets are non-transferable, so buyer beware.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435526" data-ratio="0.2938689217759" data-width="1892" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435526"></a><figcaption>Think twice before buying a non-transferable ticket on eBay.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png"></figure><p>The event will take place at various locations around the world in North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.
