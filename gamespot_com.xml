                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting August 5: <strong>Lies of P</strong>, <strong>DayZ</strong>, and <strong>My Hero: One's Justice 2</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-july-2025/1100-6532665/" data-ref-id="1100-6532665">July's PlayStation Plus free games</a> yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr">Will we ever get a Bloodborne remaster or a sequel? Who knows, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-review-no-strings-attached/1900-6418114/" data-ref-id="1900-6418114">Lies of P</a> is the next best thing. Heavily inspired by the From Software classic, the game puts a dark spin on the tale of Pinocchio and complements it with polished gameplay that'll appeal to fans of the souls-like genre. An expansion for it called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lies-of-p-overture-review-puppet-prelude/1900-6418370/" data-ref-id="1900-6418370">Overture</a> launched in June, adding a great story and even more challenging enemies to this stylish game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> has been around for quite a while, and in case you haven't checked it out yet, this is a hardcore dive into the survival genre. Set inside of a massive world, the only thing more dangerous than zombies are your fellow players.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">My Hero: One's Justice 2</a> is an adaptation of the hit manga and anime series My Hero Academia. It's pretty much a standard 3D arena-fighter game featuring heroes and villains from My Hero Academia, but with a new game on the way that adapts the final arc, it's worth picking this up to get up to speed with the story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus free game for August 2025 </h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4540301-ps-plus-august.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4540301-ps-plus-august.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540301"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Plus August 2025 games for Premium, Extra, and Essential subscribers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4540301-ps-plus-august.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em>Available August 5 until September 1</em></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lies of P</li><li dir="ltr">DayZ</li><li dir="ltr">My Hero: One's Justice 2</li></ul>

Developer Ballistic Moon added a reworked prologue and adjusted the story's pacing so that several characters were given more screen time, threw in new collectibles to discover, and added several accessibility settings. Visually, the game also has updated character models, environments, visual effects, and animations alongside new interactive props and artistic changes that heighten the spooky atmosphere.</p>                      </div><p>Until Dawn's live-action movie adaptation released in April and finished its theatrical run with over $53 million worldwide. Not exactly a smash hit, but it brought in more than three times its $15 million budget. It's a fun horror movie and a solid take on the source material with some clever new ideas mixed in. Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray edition released earlier this month for $50. Along with the 4K UHD disc, you'll get a standard Blu-ray disc, a code to redeem the digital edition, and a number of bonus materials that explore how this gruesome film was produced.</p><p>Here's the full list of Until Dawn special features:</p><ul><li>Adapting a Nightmare - Director David F. Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman discuss the inspirations of the film and how they built off of the game world from the hit PlayStation game.</li><li>Death-Defying Cast - Meet the cast</li><li>Practical Terrors - A look at the practical effects and props used to garner realistic reactions from the actors and actresses.p</li><li>Audio Commentary with director David F.

                <p>News about the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> doesn't sound like it will be coming soon, as Blizzard has said it will next update the community on what's next for its ARPG around the launch of Season 10.</p><p dir="ltr">In a reply to a fan on X asking for Diablo 4 updates, Diablo's director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the following.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 Launch.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 launch," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Diablo 4 Season 9's in-game timer, Season 10 is likely to start September 23. Typically, public test realm tests for a season are done several weeks prior, which would put the PTR around early September or perhaps late August. That means the game's next Campfire Chat, where Blizzard regularly outlines its future Diablo 4 plans, will be around that same time.</p><p dir="ltr">What that translates to is that, for about a month, there will likely be no news about what's next for Diablo 4. It's a bit confusing for fans, as a handful of Diablo 4 content creators recently revealed they attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Blizzard meeting on Diablo 4's future</a>. During the meeting they were shown what sounds like some of the significant changes fans have been asking to be currently in the works for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">News of the content creator meeting led many to believe some major announcements about how Blizzard will improve Diablo 4 to be imminent. Fletcher himself said in June that players' "warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," and stated that the team "has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a> states that Season 10, Infernal Chaos, will be the last season for 2025, and will bring changes to the game's Infernal Hordes activity, new seasonal powers, and a new IP crossover. In 2026, the roadmap <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">teases a new expansion</a>, ranking system, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible Blizzard could still make a new Diablo 4 expansion announcement at Gamescom in August, but it seems like players may have to wait longer than they'd like in order to learn what steps Blizzard is taking to improve the ARPG in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, Diablo 4 Season 9, which recently just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-patch-notes-reveal-increased-rewards-and-big-barbarian-buffs/1100-6533122/" data-ref-id="1100-6533122">majorly buffed Barbarians</a>, is ongoing. Blizzard is also preparing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release Diablo 4 in China</a> after receiving government approval.</p>
