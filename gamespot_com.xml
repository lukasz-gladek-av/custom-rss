                <p>Fans of Wicked certainly felt a stirring when the film finally got to the musical's best-known song, Defying Gravity, but they probably didn't notice the subtle Fortnite sound effect during its final sequence. That's right: Some of the sounds of Elphaba flying in the final sequence are straight from your nephew's favorite battle royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-this-is-true-but-wickeds-biggest-song-features-a-hidden-fortnite-cameo" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, you can see this unlikely detail in a video from the Rough Cut that features Wicked editor Myron Kerstein breaking down the complex final scene of the film, which features a wild mix of visual effects along with the music. At around the 7:20 mark in the video, you can see "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing" right in the middle of the editing timeline.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBAv0Ld38Lk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the sound effect that plays when you jump out of the Battle Bus and shoot towards the ground. Fortnite developer Epic Games released the sound as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnGwhm9e6fM">royalty-free library sample</a>, and it seems that Kerstein used it to full effect. The Rough Cut video is quite an interesting watch if you're interested in film production or just curious about the amount of work that goes into even a relatively short scene in a big film like Wicked.</p><p dir="ltr">Artists aren't shy about using samples, whether that's in video games, movies, or even music, and you can find lengthy YouTube videos that investigate the origin of these audio clips. For example, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGt57ndBrpU">25-minute video</a> exploring the sources for the music of the Spyro series. In other Wicked news, the hit film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wicked-film-adaptation-gets-lego-sets-new-book-box-sets-and-more-merch/2900-5759/">got a Lego set</a> and other merch that's definitely worth checking out.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k20/" data-ref-id="5000-500607">WWE 2K20</a> was, in no uncertain terms, an abject disaster. For a series so often insulated in its wrestling fandom bubble, it was trending on social media for a period in late 2019 after it launched because of how severe and sometimes hilarious the bugs were. The game was so poorly received that the series actually took a year off. This is practically unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and sports entertainment) games. Since then, WWE 2K has rebounded incredibly over the course of several games.</p><p dir="ltr">You could argue the WWE 2K series, like Cody Rhodes, finished its story last year, with a great game that does most of what it wants to do very well. Now, like WWE's poster boy is learning week in and week out, heavy lies the crown. Where does the series go from here? To a great extent, the goal has already been achieved. The belt is around the game's waist. At the same time, "the story" continues unabated when the next game is perpetually coming down the pipeline, so there's no opportunity to pause and enjoy the fruits of your labor. After several hours with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a>, this next chapter seems like another step up, even as what might ultimately conclude the next chapter hasn't yet been revealed in full.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791"></a><figcaption>In an annualized video game, like in pro wrestling, the story is never truly over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k22/" data-ref-id="5000-529940">WWE 2K22</a> was a "comeback year," lead combat designer Derek Donahue told me. "We had extra time. There was no 2K21. We also rebuilt the game. We redid so many core systems, but we still hadn't been able to redo everything we wanted. I think you could look at [2K22], and it's almost unrecognizable from the engine and the tools that we were working with back on 2K20, especially. But it's taken many, many years to get to a point where now this feels like our game and the way that we've always envisioned being able to work on it and build it."</p><p dir="ltr">Donahue spoke to how the last two games helped reshape the culture around the series. "[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k23/" data-ref-id="5000-580650">2K23</a>] was a unique kind of challenge, in the sense that, now we have to do it in a year like we used to, right? We didn't have the extra time. It was really, really gratifying to pull off what we did with [2K23], especially WarGames and all that. [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k24/" data-ref-id="5000-615521">2K24</a>] was finally, like, 'Can you repeat it?' And I feel like we're at the point where we've proven ourselves and said, 'Hey, we can come back to this annual franchise, make huge improvements each year with the game on its own, standing alone as something that feels good.' But it also, of course, ups the stakes, because expectations are higher than they've ever been, so it's about meeting those expectations."</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, the perception was that WWE 2K20 fell apart because Yuke's, the Japanese studio making WWE games since 2000, left the series, and the team that remained wasn't able to overcome that absence. Donahue told me that's not exactly the case. More accurately, the team that would replace Yuke's didn't really exist yet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yuke's made the game for, like, 20 years," Donahue said. "It's a huge amount of institutional knowledge they have. And the goals that we had when setting out from 2K20 and beyond were to modernize a lot of systems. I think when a game gets as big as ours is, it is an extremely hard challenge to take something that works <em>now</em>, but needs to be rebuilt to do something for <em>tomorrow</em>; it takes so many resources, and you have to pick and choose what you're going to do, and to do that in an individual year just seemed insurmountable.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it was a huge change in the way that we work on the game, and what goals we are setting, and what expectations we have for ourselves and for the product. To bring everything in-house was a massive effort. When we worked with Yuke's, it was like 20-something people in our office, including designers, producers, some entrance cutscene animators, but almost everything else was happening across the world with the people who we spoke with and translated emails and had weekly meetings with, but it was so disconnected from our work and made it really challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189"></a><figcaption>Intergender matches are finally playable, so you can pit Rhea against Dom in any kind of match you prefer... or even all of them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We always knew we wanted to be able to sit next to an engineer and work with somebody in the same office and collaborate in a way in which we knew we'd be able to do so much more. But the gulf between where we were and where we wanted to be was so vast, and so it's really taken this time for us to finally get to this point."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features in this year's game is the third-person camera controls. Whereas past games allowed you to present matches from the real-life hardcam angle or the retro-inspired entrance-facing camera, this year's game also gives you the option to dynamically control the angle at any time using the right stick. In moments when you need the right stick to perform something in-game other than adjusting the camera, like pinning or turning an opponent, you just hold down the right trigger while you use it, like the shift key on a computer performing a secondary function.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the right trigger wasn't mapped to anything before anyway, the effect was a seamless new toy that enhanced the many matches I played, giving me directorial control of how each match was presented. It's interesting to note that the team originally built this feature for entrances, but when they liked it so much, they decided to apply it to the matches themselves, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The third-person camera is especially useful in backstage brawls, as I could swing the camera around a full 360 degrees and better see and utilize the space in settings new and old, like when I found I could climb up several structures in the WWE Archives and throw my opponent to the floor far below like he was doing a forced Mick Foley impression. I'd overlooked that space until I opted to change the camera settings during the match. With the camera's aid, my match was better off for it, translating into more stars in the game's Meltzer-like rating system.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the exciting new feature the marketing team plans to lead with, assumedly, but in practice, I expect players to come to really appreciate it, and many will prefer it as their go-to option. It's a subtle but satisfying change to a game building on a much sturdier foundation these days. However, the more broadly exciting additions to the game are--as they often are--the Showcase mode and new match types. I played three Showcase matches, which this year highlights the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty. This includes current superstars like Roman Reigns and Nia Jax, as well as past legends like The Rock and The Wild Samoans. Showcase is WWE 2K's annual history lesson and reliably a great time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191"></a><figcaption>The Bloodline Showcase arrives just as Jacob Fatu's meteoric rise feels like it's hitting a new speed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was disappointed to see the seamless transitions from gameplay to real-life stock footage from the matches have been removed, but I learned there are a few reasons for that. For one, the team said players largely didn't like that feature--that's absurd to me, but I can understand being in the minority on that one means I won't get my way. Another reason that aspect isn't on display in 2K25 is because Showcase features some fantasy matches we never got to see in real life, like The Wild Samoans taking on The Dudley Boyz in a tables match.</p><p dir="ltr">More noticeably absent from the Showcase mode is Brock Lesnar, who is such a major chapter in the story of cover star Roman Reigns that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brock-lesnar-and-vince-mcmahon-arent-playable-in-wwe-2k24-but-arent-gone-entirely/1100-6521315/">you can sometimes see the game skirting around his existence</a> for the second year in a row, like when a cutscene tells the story of Seth Rollins' famous cash-in at WrestleMania 31. Rollins pinned and had more of a feud with Reigns, but Lesnar was in that match, too, and he's entirely missing from the cutscene--not to suggest I want him there. It's just notable when the 2K team has to dodge-roll away from some of the wrestling company's past scandals.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I'm greatly looking forward to this mode, as I found last year's WrestleMania-focused match list to have filled in some of my knowledge gaps as a fan, and I have no doubt this year's will do that with The Bloodline family tree, too. It also helps that it's all narrated by Paul Heyman. Based on what I saw, Heyman is giving his fullest effort, not at all phoning it in. I don't think the man even knows how.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the new Showcase, new match types like Underground and Bloodline Rules, and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">recently announced WWE 2K25 features </a>all seem to build on last year's game in ways players are going to appreciate, my most anticipated feature of this year's game is rather simple: the addition of online multiplayer in GM mode. Equivalent to something like an Owner mode in NBA 2K or Madden, GM mode asks that you book shows, manage production, and run your roster--and to do it all so well that you actually defeat the competition--in this case, expressed as cross-company rivalries like Smackdown, Raw, and NXT, rather than something like AEW.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190"></a><figcaption>Of those I saw while playing the game, character models look excellent and, in many cases, are clearly improved from last year's.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">GM mode is already where I spend the majority of my time with the game. I love to make stars out of those who aren't yet at that level in reality, putting my own stamp on the WWE Universe. The prospect of playing it with three others online likely ensures I spend even more time in the mode this year. I'm eager to see how things like drafts and trades are implemented, but if done well, WWE 2K25's online GM mode might be my new favorite sports league I'm a part of--and there are already a few of those in my life.</p><p dir="ltr">With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25. There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year. But what I played gives the community more of what they want on top of a much sturdier foundation than the series had just a few short years ago. I have more questions to answer for myself, and I'll get to them before I've published my review, but as any patient wrestling fan would suggest, for now, I'll let it play out.</p>

                <p>Steam has added a new warning to the Steam pages of early-access games that have not been updated in a long time.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB spotted</a> this addition to the early-access widget on Steam pages. Steam has historically denoted that early access games "are not complete and may or may not change further," but it's now getting more specific as to when a game was previously updated, regardless of what the developers wrote in their early access widget. Specifically, it seems to kick in if the publicly available build of an early-access title has not seen an update in over 12 months.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atlas/" data-ref-id="5000-490221">Atlas</a>, a pirate open-world game from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ark-survival-ascended/" data-ref-id="5000-609380">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> that was released in early access in 2018 but has not gotten an update since May 2023. A message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/834910/ATLAS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Steam page</a> now reads, "Note: The last update made by the developers was over 20 months ago. The information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date." Similar messages can be found on the Steam pages for games like Pirate Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heartbound</a>, Hi-Rez Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale_Reforged" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Realm Royale Reforged</a>, and League of Geeks' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1893820/Jumplight_Odyssey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumplight Odyssey</a>.</p><p>Although Steam can't force developers to update their games or bring them out of early access, this warning at least gives potential buyers a clear warning that the game they're about to purchase hasn't been supported in a while. You can check the Steam News page of any early-access title or SteamDB to see when a game was updated last.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-by-daylight-review-2020-toying-with-terror/1900-6417532/" data-ref-id="1900-6417532">Dead by Daylight</a> have so much common ground that Capcom's iconic survival-horror series has already had two collaborations with Behaviour Interactive's asymmetric multiplayer game. Now, a third Dead by Daylight and Resident Evil crossover is just days away, and it's going to pit players against two of RE's most famous villains.</p><p>Dead by Daylight's latest 2v8 mode will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a>'s Nemesis and The Mastermind--aka longtime RE villain Albert Wesker--together as they hunt down Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Rebecca Chambers. All of these characters have appeared in at least one of the previous Resident Evil collaborations with this title. Dead by Daylight's original monster, The Legion, will also be a part of this event.</p><p>In an amusing touch, this collaboration is even including Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs, which have been a staple of the franchise from the beginning. At the start of each match, green and yellow herbs will spawn in random locations and survivors can use them for healing. However, if either Nemesis or Wesker get to the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a brief increase in their speed.</p><p>For the duration of the collaboration between February 10-25, all Resident Evil characters will be free to play in 2v8 mode. Just to make the RE characters feel at home, the 2v8 mode will revisit Raccoon City's Police Department--as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3. That's only one of the maps that will be featured in this 2v8 event, but the others have yet to be specified.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has also noted that there will be two survivor bots on every team in 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. Outside of the core Dead by Daylight game, Behavior and Supermassive released a spin-off title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone/" data-ref-id="5000-612203">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>. Additionally, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">a Dead by Daylight collaboration with Five Nights At Freddy's</a> coming this summer.</p>

In 2024, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">closed one of its AAA studios</a>, headed up by industry veterans including former Halo boss Joseph Staten. Netflix still has an internal game development studio, <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/team?slug=netflix-games-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix Games Studio</a>, as well as wholly owned external teams such as Night School Studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, and Next Games.</p><p>During an earnings call recently, Netflix boss Gregory Peters said Netflix has "plenty more" planned in the video game space, with the aim of launching "bigger and bigger games every year." Peters acknowledged that Netflix was in the middle of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">"refine" its strategy for game launches</a>, which might explain why the six games mentioned here are no longer being released on Netflix.</p><p>Going forward, Peters said Netflix will focus on "more narrative games" based on Netflix franchises, while at the same time launching "party and couch co-op games" for your TV delivered from the cloud. Netflix's main offerings for games currently are on mobile, but the company has--<a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/testing-games-on-more-devices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for years now</a>--worked on cloud streaming to beam games directly to your TV or computer.</p><p>"We think of this as a successor to family board-game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be. So we're excited about delivering some cool experiences in that space," Peter said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> Season 24 kicks off on February 11, one week after the game's sixth birthday. The new season doesn't add a new playable legend, map, weapon, or support item, but does make some major changes to the Assault class to make it more lethal, buffs every single firearm, nerfs armor, and introduces Arsenals--new kiosk-like contraptions on every map that can build the gun and attachments you want to make it easier for players to acquire their preferred loadout. These additions all seem to be in service of making the time-to-kill in Apex Legends substantially shorter.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll reserve full judgment for the start of the season, but I'm not a huge fan of that direction. A big part of why I like Apex Legends is because the time-to-kill is much slower than other competitive shooters, like Call of Duty or PUBG. In Apex Legends, you have to pump quite a few shots into an opponent to put them out of the fight--it's very forgiving, especially if you've been playing the game for years and know how to best rotate around each map to quickly move between cover and heal on the move. The Respawn team feels confident that changing this formula is the right direction for the game, noting that the faster time-to-kill shouldn't be too drastic, as these changes will be countered by buffs to healing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"There's no way around it--increased damage, lowering [the] max level [of body shields] from red down to purple... these are absolutely affecting the time-to-kill in Apex," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese told me. "We've done some things on the other side to accommodate for that [like making] healing a little bit faster--the cells and the syringes, you'll be able to pop faster, so there's a little less down time, [and] you [can] stack a bit more of them [per slot] in your inventory... We improved the knockdown state [as well] so that you can crawl to your friends a little bit faster."</p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, this change could address one of Apex Legends' longest-running problems: third-partying, or the act of moving on two other teams in the midst of a fight and taking advantage of both of their weakened states to score some easy kills. It's a popular strategy in Apex Legends and an ongoing annoyance. By making it easier to finish off your opponent (or for them to finish off you), the hope is that fights wrap up before another team has a chance to come in and third-party.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439221-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439221" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439221-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439221"></a><figcaption>It also sucks to finish up a fight and then find yourself immediately surrounded by another team.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439221-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're hoping [this season update is] going to bring a little bit more punctuation to those combats, which allows you to reset [and] get ready for those third-parties because everybody's going to hear that gunfire," Canavese said. "Fights are going to feel a little bit more lethal. Cover [is] going to be a little bit more important, making the right rotations and not just running out in the middle of a field and then, 'Oh, I got shot a couple of times, I'll just run away and heal.' Everything's going to be a little bit more dangerous. But it's going to promote good strategy and good tactics, and playing for the win and [trying] to work with your team and use your abilities to the best that you can so that you can not get blown up immediately."</p><p dir="ltr">As part of the plan to make firefights feel more dangerous, the Assault class is getting a major update this season, mirroring what Respawn has done for three of the other four classes so far. Season 24 makes it so Assault legends can more easily carry extra grenades, and they now get both a speed boost and automatically mark targets when they break enemy body shields so that they can close on wounded foes. On top of those changes, both Ash and Ballistic are getting changes to their overall kit and improvements to certain skills. None of the changes sound as impactful as the updates in 2024 that improved the Support class and made drastic shifts to the kits of characters like Lifeline and Loba, but the Assault class is already quite powerful, so it makes sense they're not getting a huge buff.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439222-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439222" data-ratio="0.58733624454148" data-width="1374" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439222-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439222"></a><figcaption>Following the major update to the Support class, Apex Legends is focusing on the Assault characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439222-s0_lifeline5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We've been tracking this particular type of class-wide change for the last couple seasons now," lead legend designer Devan McGuire told me. "We're at Assault, we've done Controller and Recon and Support. ...So there's only really one class left [Skirmisher], so that will at least end that particular dynasty [of updates]. And then we'll be looking at a different method of making, again, impactful changes that allow certain characters to rise into the spotlights."</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of what these changes might look like and what's in store for Apex Legends in 2025 during its sixth year, tons of new playable legends doesn't sound like it's in the cards. "What we've seen is that the addition of a new legend hasn't had as much of an impact on the general feel of the game as it has in the past," McGuire said. "With the larger roster, you're not seeing this legend show up as much in every session. You may have certain play styles that just don't map to the way that that legend plays, and you don't necessarily want to put that effort into it. But when a change affects a [whole] class, chances are you play someone in that class or you're playing with someone who's [using] that class and you do get affected, your gameplay changes and you feel those moments. So it has a different sort of pull."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439223-s9_valkyrie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439223-s9_valkyrie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439223"></a><figcaption>I miss the excitement surrounding new legends dropping into the game every three months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439223-s9_valkyrie.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to make the rank climb feel different, and that is mostly done through changing the core game," design director Evan Nikolich added. "So when we had six legends or eight legends, adding a new legend had a huge ripple effect. You have 26 legends and [add someone new], it's not nearly as impactful versus making a systemic wide change. And you're going to see that across [the game]. This season, we're doing a lot with weapons. [In] future seasons, we're touching maps and touching the [battle royale] rules and really evolving what you're seeing, game to game, frame to frame. What you're fighting is more impactful than a new legend. When we do add new legends, we want something that really strikes at the core of Apex and ripples out significantly. So [Season 21's] Alter is fantastic, but she doesn't have the same impact [as], say, when we added [Season 1's] Octane."</p><p dir="ltr">"Also, players who are new or coming in fresh are more often [the ones] lured by the idea of, 'Oh, there's a character I've never seen before and there's abilities I've never seen before,'" McGuire said, adding that most players who have been playing Apex Legends for years have their go-to picks already locked and are less likely to be as excited by new faces. There are outliers of course--a friend of mine pretty much only played Pathfinder from day one but since Season 21, he's been an Alter main. He's the only one I know, though, and most of the lobbies I'm in see me go up against legends from the first 10 seasons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439225-s13_lovetriangle2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439225" data-ratio="0.55898876404494" data-width="1424" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439225-s13_lovetriangle2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439225"></a><figcaption>Respawn hopes to make Apex Legends more fun for new players in 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4439225-s13_lovetriangle2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I think Alter had the unfortunate case of being a character who has a lot of interplay with her team and coming out in a season that had the Solos mode [return] alongside [her]," McGuire said. "There's very little synergy between the Solos mode and Alter, and I think a lot of people didn't get a chance to fully experience what she could [add] to the equation. We're seeing a rise in that now with some of the recent changes, and we're hoping that that will continue for her moving forward. But yeah, we're definitely shifting our mentality away from 'How often can we get a new character in?' to more of a, 'What can we do to impact the game experience and make that stay as fresh as [possible] and important to the core of the game?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Moving away from a strategy of regularly adding new playable legends carries its own risks, of course. The most important--to me, anyway--being the narrative draw that they used to add, curating an experience that felt like a serial TV show that you needed to stay up to date with or pay attention to. New characters were a strong draw for new players and a powerful incentive for longtime players to stay glued into the game's ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">"The shift [in our strategy] you're seeing [in 2025] is constantly shifting and evolving," Nikolich said. "It feels fresh and fun. I think [another] big [goal] is really helping players find the fun. As the game gets older, the player base gets more consolidated, and we love our hardcore audience, but they also [play a lot]--the skill floor has risen so high. As we're bringing new players in, we really need to do a much better job helping [them] find the fun. Where we get better is that first five minutes. You're like, 'Yeah, I'm in. I love this.' And you [could get] that really well [in the early seasons] where everyone was learning and you [could] have a good match pretty quickly. Now getting [your first] good match as a new player can be tough, and so we're going to really focus on helping players find their fun over the next several seasons. Both now in [Season 24] and the next several splits."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends is available for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC.</p>
