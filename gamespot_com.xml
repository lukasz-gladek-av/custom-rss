                <p>Console commands are a part of the very fabric that makes up Bethesda RPGs. While they're exclusive to the PC versions of games, console commands offer players a way to gain a small, or large, edge during their playthrough. The original Oblivion featured a laundry list of console commands, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> has brought all of them back.</p><p>Some console commands are fairly harmless in Cyrodiil, while others can completely alter your playthrough. You can activate god mode to rain down hellfire on the citizens of the country, or simply add some items to your inventory that you need for a quest. In any case, you can see a complete list of every console command and how to use them in Oblivion Remastered below. Naturally, for much more on the game, refer to our complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_use_console_commands_in_Oblivion_Remastered">How to use console commands in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>First up, let's talk about how to use console commands. As previously mentioned, <strong>this is a PC-only feature</strong> in Oblivion Remastered, so PlayStation and Xbox players will have to sit this one out.</p><p>PC players can follow the steps below to activate console commands:</p><ul><li>Once you're in-game, press the tilde (~) key, next to the 1 key, on your keyboard</li><li>This brings up the console command menu, which is a large black text box that has a repeating line at the bottom of it</li><li>The repeating line indicates where you can type in your console command</li><li>To use a console command, simply type it in exactly as it appears in the list below, press Enter, and your cheat will activate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286"></a><figcaption>The console command text box in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png"></figure><p>As you'll see when you bring up the console command menu, <strong>achievements become disabled if you use any kind of cheat</strong>.

In the list below, you'll see each console command itself and its description. You must type the console command exactly as it appears in the list when you activate it in-game. If you put even a space where it's not supposed to be, the console command won't work.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Console Command</th><th scope="col">In-game

playthrough. Adding and removing items from your inventory, messing with enemies, and changing your level, skills, and attributes will likely be the commands you use the most frequently, though.</p>

                <p>The NBA is collaborating with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765" data-mce-href="/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> once again, this year dropping a pair of new NBA-themed skins based on Axo and Fishstick. In this drop, the fan-favorite Fortnite characters are sporting jackets that feature the team logos from either the Eastern or Western Conferences as style options, and their heads have been redesigned slightly to make them look like basketballs. This new set will hit the item shop on Thursday.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266" data-ratio="0.5624607658506" data-width="1593" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266"></a><figcaption>What the new NBA cosmetics look like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to the skins themselves, the new set of cosmetics includes two back blings, two pickaxes, and two emotes--and it'll reportedly be available all in one bundle. The highlight here may well be one of the back blings, actually. There's a mini jumbotron back bling in the set that counts your kills during a round, and lights up and plays arena organ music every time you defeat an enemy player. That back bling will be available to buy on its own for 400 V-Bucks.</p><p>The bundle that includes everything will <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost 2200 V-Bucks</a>, with each of the skins costing 1200 separately. The pickaxes are 500 each, and the emotes will be 300 each.</p><p>The NBA's collaboration with Fortnite began years ago with <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=4771" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=4771" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">customizable players skins</a> that let you pick which team's uniform you want to wear. But those skins haven't been sold in the item shop since 2022--since a number of those uniforms are now outdated, those probably will not be coming back. Instead, Fortnite has dropped three waves of other NBA-themed skins, including the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75th anniversary defaults</a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cel-shaded skins</a> that use fake team logos, and now these basketball re-dos of Axo and Fishstick.</p><p>It's been a busy month for Fortnite collaborations, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417" data-mce-href="/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/" data-ref-id="1100-6530777" data-mce-href="/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/">Adventure Time</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/" data-ref-id="1100-6530911" data-mce-href="/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/">two new WWE wrestlers</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/" data-ref-id="1100-6531017" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/">four new TMNT characters</a>, these NBA skins, and, next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/" data-ref-id="1100-6530990" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/">Marvel's Winter Soldier and White Widow</a>.

Upon further investigation the individual pages for each game, though, you'll see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a Metascore of 95 on Xbox Series X|S, 91 on PC, and 92 on PS5, while Blue Prince has a 92 on PC, 84 on PS5, and 89 on Xbox.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG inspired by classics in the genre. It's set in a world where everyone above a certain age dies when a number is painted in the sky, and players set off as part of the titular expedition in hopes of defeating the Paintress behind this. Its provocative story and intense RPG gameplay really resonated with critics, including GameSpot's own.</p><p>"This is a supremely confident game that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye, Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">GameSpot's very positive review</a>. "Its combat is a consistent delight, delivering thrills with thoughtful strategy and reactive action in equal measure, complementing a heartfelt story of shared grief and camaraderie."</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> also dropped this week and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">threatened to overshadow</a> Sandfall's debut, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is proving to be the can't-miss RPG of this month.

Of course, if you see a Birthsign that works well with the build or character you're going for, choose that one and press on.</p><h2 id="Best_Birthsigns_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Birthsigns in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Let's talk about the best Birthsigns you can choose. There are four Birthsigns that stand out among the rest, and you can see what they are below:</p><p><strong>The Thief </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481109"></a><figcaption>The Thief Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481109-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.25.55.png"></figure><p>The Thief is arguably the best overall Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered, regardless of what class or build you're going with. It increases three separate attributes, Agility, Luck, and Speed, by 10 points, giving you a massive head start. Agility and Speed are useful attributes for any build, as they're both incredibly helpful to have when exploring the world. However, both are useful in combat, as well, if you're moving around in any capacity. The increase in Luck is also beneficial, granting you a small bonus on all of your other skills.</p><p><strong>The Atronach </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481113" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481113"></a><figcaption>The Atronach Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481113-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.34.65.png"></figure><p>If you're planning on playing a magic character in Oblivion Remastered, there are two main Birthsigns you want to target: the Mage and the Atronach. The Mage grants you a base bonus to Magicka and calls it a day, and this is usually the better choice for beginners. However, the Atronach completely changes up the magic gameplay, granting you a huge bonus to Magicka but making it so you can't regenerate Magicka naturally. Instead, you gain Magicka by siphoning it from magic enemies, drinking potions, and using Welkynd Stones.</p><p><strong>The Lady </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481122"></a><figcaption>The Lady Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481122-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.39.70.png"></figure><p>The Lady is a classic Birthsign in Oblivion, and it's one of the best you can choose for any build. It simply boosts your Willpower and Endurance by 10 points right out of the gate, granting you some great attribute bonuses as soon as you start your journey. Willpower affects your Alteration, Restoration, and Destruction stats, as well as affects the regeneration of Magicka and fatigue. Endurance affects your base HP, fatigue, time to hold your breath, and how much health you increase after leveling up. Both are tremendous attributes to boost in Oblivion Remastered, so The Lady is always going to be a solid pick.</p><p><strong>The Shadow </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481123" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481123"></a><figcaption>The Shadow Birthsign in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481123-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.23.31.21.png"></figure><p>Finally, The Shadow allows you to unlock arguably the best Birthsign spell in Oblivion Remastered. You gain access to the Moonshadow spell, which lets you become invisible for a minute. The spell can only be used once a day, but it's incredibly helpful in combat, exploration, and during quests. There's a plethora of uses for invisibility in Oblivion Remastered, so having access to Moonshadow can be a godsend at any time.</p><p>And that wraps up the best Birthsigns in Oblivion Remastered. Again, there's no one correct choice, but there are some options that allow you to gain a quick head start in Cyrodiil to make your journey easier.</p>
