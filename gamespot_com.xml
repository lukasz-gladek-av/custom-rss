                <p>While everyone is waiting for Nintendo to announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">could happen as soon as January 16</a>--the company had a different hardware-related announcement this week. The Alarmo clock will be available for everyone to buy in stores starting this March, and that's a little later than expected.</p><p>The clock went on sale back in late 2024 for Nintendo Switch Online members, but relatively soon it will be available for everyone to buy. Nintendo said it will sell the $100 clock "while supplies last." Previously, Nintendo said it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241009141134/https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo-2670177.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would launch Alarmo at retail in January</a>, but it's now being delayed to March.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1878897739666280752" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Nintendo Sound Clock: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Alarmo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Alarmo</a> will be available in stores at participating retailers in March 2025, no Nintendo Switch Online membership required. Available while supplies last. <a href="https://t.co/qhVo0NMKjx" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/qhVo0NMKjx</a></p>  — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1878897739666280752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Alarmo is an interactive clock that features Nintendo-themed animations, sounds, and characters. It also has motion-sensing technology so you can hit snooze without physically tapping the device. Alarmo features 42 different scenes, based on games like Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Mario Kart 8, with scenes from Animal Crossing: New Horizons coming later via an update.</p><p>Beyond using Alarmo for its normal functions, people have discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hacker-puts-playable-version-of-doom-on-nintendo-alarmo/1100-6527574/" data-ref-id="1100-6527574">Alarmo can be hacked to run Doom.</a></p><p>As for the Switch 2, a recent report said Nintendo may announce the console on January 16 and then release it in May or June. There have also been reports of Microsoft bringing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo: The Master Chief Collection to Switch 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-assassins-creed-games-may-come-to-switch-2-report/1100-6528782/" data-ref-id="1100-6528782">Ubisoft supporting the console with Assassin's Creed ports. </a></p>

For the former, rewards include weapon and armor refining parts, an in-game hoodie layered equipment, and a collaboration guild card background. As for Wilds, you can get a gift code to redeem mega potions, energy drinks, dash juices, and other support items to aid your future hunts.</p><p>If you want to be up to date with each reward batch, make sure to log into Now every Monday in February from 9 AM (local time) to get a supply with item box expansions, potions, and the aforementioned refining parts. Some premium collaboration packs in the in-game shop will also be available from February 3 to February 28.</p><p>You can find more information about the collab event in the official <a href="https://monsterhunternow.com/en/news/collab-jan2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">unveiled as soon as this week</a>, according to some reports. But once the system arrives, the real question is what's going to be on it beyond AAA Nintendo titles? According to a new report, Nintendo may have already secured some AAA support from Konami, Square Enix, and Ubisoft.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate the Hate</a> is reporting that Konami's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will be among the titles available on Switch 2, as will Square Enix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. But it sounds like Ubisoft will be going even deeper by bringing a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> for the Switch 2 launch window. The upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, is also said to be in the works for Switch 2, but not in time for the system's launch. That title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">recently pushed back to March</a>.</p><p>The report goes to mention that Ubisoft is "doing more than half a dozen games for the Switch 2," including a game from The Division series, Rainbow Six Siege, and a potential compilation of the two Mario + Rabbids games. Earlier this month, a separate report from Nate the Hate suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Microsoft will bring Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to both Switch 2 and PS5 in 2025.</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">Switch 2 could sell 4.3 million consoles</a> this year alone in the US, according to at least one video game analyst. Despite Nintendo's veil of secrecy, potentially leaked details about the Switch 2 have been running rampant. At CES, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">a Switch 2 mockup</a> that may have earned the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">a visit by Nintendo's lawyers</a>. Once Nintendo officially announces Switch 2, the level of interest it attracts may only get bigger as it gets closer to launch.</p>

This includes the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset, 8GB RAM, and support for the Touch Pro controllers. The main difference is in the lenses, as the Quest 3S uses 1832 x 1920 Fresnel lenses (found in the Quest 2) while the Quest 3 uses 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses. However, the lower resolution should result in longer battery life.

                <p>The first major professional tennis tournament of the year, the Australian Open, is underway now in Melbourne. New for the 2025 event is an alternate broadcast that makes players look like something out of Wii Sports. The Australian Open organizers rolled out what they are calling "AO Animated" versions of tennis matches this year, featuring animated, video game-looking versions of the real players.</p><p>As you can see in the video game, from the Jacob Fearnley vs. Nick Kyrgios match, the animation is far from perfect--at times, the player's racket and the tennis ball vanish out of thin air. The audio doesn't sync up perfectly, either. But it's pretty solid, all things considered. You can watch more of these matches on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open YouTube page under the "Live" tab.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fla1j5t4-Ws" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fla1j5t4-Ws" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Broadcasts of this nature are becoming more and more popular these days. Before this, the NFL and Disney+ partnered to air a very <a href="https://www.nfl.com/schedules/simpsons-funday-football" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre-looking Simpsons-themed broadcast</a> of the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Dallas Cowboys game on December 9. This broadcast had the likes of Homer, Bart, Moe, Carl, Barney, and Lenny suiting up and making plays on the field.</p><p>Before that, the NHL and Disney teamed up for a video game-style broadcast of a professional hockey game, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-nhl-broadcast-will-look-like-a-video-game-tonight-and-a-chicken-will-drop-the-puck/1100-6512314/" data-ref-id="1100-6512314">characters from the show Big City Greens lacing up their skates.</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-playoff-game-is-on-nickelodeon-this-sunday-with-spongebob-graphics-and-slime/1100-6499505/" data-ref-id="1100-6499505">who could forget the NFL's slime game featuring SpongeBob</a>?</p>

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly announcing a new entry in a "legendary Japanese IP" during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23.

                <p>Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 launches later this week and developer Grinding Gear has now previewed what to expect from it.. According to game director Jonathan Rogers, this patch primarily addresses issues developer Grinding Gear can address "relatively quickly," such as endgame maps and enemy balance.</p><p>You can see some of the details in a new video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile YouTube</a> channel. Endgame mapping (i.e. the autogeneration of levels) have received a balance overhaul, altering the number of chests, number of monsters, and lots of other variables. Four new "Tower" maps have been added, and the first Tower map, Lost Towers, has been redesigned to be "less boring." More endgame maps will include bosses, correcting a glitch that causes fewer bosses to spawn than intended.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNJSDxwC9bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pinnacle content has gotten some tweaks too. You'll be able to see citadels from further away in the fog of war making them easier to find. You'll also get up to six respawns for the pinnacle boss The Arbiter of Ash. The respawns can only be activated by the player who put in the keys at the Burning Monolith and they affect every player in your party at once. Respawns will be added to other Pinnacle content soon.</p><p>In other changes, lower-level unique items have gotten buffs to make them more fun to use. The patch makes effects more visible, both by removing clutter from some maps and by redesigning existing effects. Many monsters and bosses have gotten significant balance changes, such as some attacks not being triggerable when the enemy is off-screen.</p><p>Rogers noted that if a specific issue isn't discussed in this patch that does not mean that Grinding Gear is not aware of it or that it will not get addressed. You can look for the full patch notes when the patch launches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 will eventually be free-to-play,</a> but if you want to get early access, you'll have to shell out some cash.
