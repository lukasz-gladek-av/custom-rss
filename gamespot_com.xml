                <p>In August, reports emerged that Microsoft had paused development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contraband/" data-ref-id="5000-533229">Contraband</a>, a co-op smuggler game from Just Cause developer Avalanche. At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cancels-xbox-game-pass-day-one-release-contraband/1100-6533776/" data-ref-id="1100-6533776">put a "hold" on production</a> rather than a full cancellation. But now, Contraband's fate appears to be sealed as mass layoffs at Avalanche have resulted in the closure of its Liverpool studio.</p><p>Avalanche announced the news <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its official site</a>, and disclosed that it means 31 developers are losing their jobs. Per United Kingdom labor laws, Avalanche initiated "<a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a collective consultation process</a>" in September before moving ahead with the layoffs and closing the studio. However, the rest of the company remains intact.</p><p>"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project," reads the message from Avalanche. "We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group. Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities."</p><p>Contraband was initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/contraband-announced-from-avalanche-studios-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/1100-6492801/" data-ref-id="1100-6492801">announced during an Xbox E3 presentation</a> in 2021. At the time, it was touted as a AAA game set in the 1970s in the fictional country of Bayan. It wasn't the only long-term game that was shuttered by Microsoft this year. Rare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everwild/" data-ref-id="5000-504763">Everwild</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/perfect-dark/" data-ref-id="5000-523746">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a> were all casualties of a purge of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">9,000 people, including Xbox employees</a>.</p><p>A recent report suggested that Microsoft's struggles to find its footing may be due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">sky-high profit goals</a> that have resulted in multiple waves of layoffs at the company.</p>
