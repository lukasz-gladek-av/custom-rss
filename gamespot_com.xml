                <p>Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success.</p><p>"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while," Herman said told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love."</p><p>The game was in development "for a few months," Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.</p><p>"We tried," Herman said. "Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made."</p><p>The report said "Ubisoft had lost interest" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shut down after a year and developers were laid off. </a></p><p>"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great," Herman said. "And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games."</p><p>While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splinter-cell-remake/">Splinter Cell remake is now in the works</a>. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-movie-sneaks-back-to-the-shadows-after-being-canceled/1100-6527785/" data-ref-id="1100-6527785">apparently no longer is.</a></p>

According to Nintendo itself, such a consequence was unintentional.</p><p>In a statement, Nintendo spelled out the obvious, saying: "Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock. Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock."</p>

<p>More importantly, the company claimed that it "does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility." It is unclear what Nintendo considers to be a "legal" dock.</p><p>When version 21.0.0 arrived on November 11, some Switch 2 owners took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> and other forums to share their struggles with using third-party docks after the patch. Other users have noted that their docks remain functional, and manufacturers such as <a href="https://hagibis.bbscloud.com/info/570fc56f2e5c480cbda88a6638ebed89?csr=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hagibis</a> and <a href="https://support.jemdogame.com/firmware_update_dock_20251112/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jemdo</a> have since deployed firmware updates to their docks to ensure compatibility with the latest Switch patch.</p><p>Regardless of Nintendo's intention, the sample size of users who experienced issues with their third-party docks certainly demonstrates that the latest Switch firmware update had some sort of impact on compatibility. Based on Nintendo's statement, it doesn't appear that the company is eager to remedy the situation, and it may fall on the dock makers themselves to push out their own fixes.</p><p>Switch owners may own a third-party dock for various reasons, including the desire to have docks in multiple locations within their home or for portability. Unfortunately for third-party hardware makers, Nintendo made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2's USB-C port a lot more restrictive</a> and harder to work with.</p><p>Many third-party Switch 2 docks found online range from $20 to $50. In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-dock-set-123791/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's official Switch 2 dock set</a>, which include the official dock, an ultra-high-speed HDMI cable, a USB-C cable, and an AC adapter, costs $125 USD.</p>

Years of development and millions of dollars went into the game, only for it to fail at launch and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">get canceled by Sony weeks later</a>.

                <p>Activision has once again confirmed that AI tools were used in the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is in keeping with tradition for the franchise, as Black Ops 6 utilized AI tools as well. In a statement, Activision said the creative process is handled by humans, with AI tools helping out. Back in August, Activision explained that developers working on Black Ops 7 used generative AI, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-embraces-ai-but-not-to-replace-humans/1100-6534113/" data-ref-id="1100-6534113">"none of that goes in-game."</a></p><p>"Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios," the company said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched today, November 14, and people quickly noticed that a number of Calling Cards that appear to use the "Ghibli-style" anime look, with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-littered-with-ai-art-slop-because-your-70-means-nothing-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">people theorizing</a> that Activision used AI to create these images.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7 Steam page</a> discloses that, "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same exact language</a> is featured on Black Ops 6's Steam page. Activision has not clarified exactly what content in Black Ops 7 was made with the help of AI tools.</p><h2><strong>Call of Duty's past use of AI</strong></h2><p>An anonymous source within Activision <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Wired in 2024</a> concept artists working on Call of Duty were "forced to use AI to aid in their work." The report added that "a lot of 2D artists" got laid off in early 2024 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">Microsoft's wider job cuts</a>, though whether or not this had anything to do with AI is unknown.</p><p>Activision has said its plan for AI tools is to use them to help "streamline" game development and not replace humans.</p><p>If content created at least in part by generative AI tools has made its way into past Call of Duty games, that was "by accident," Treyarch's Miles Leslie said. He may be referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">multiple instances of AI-generated content in Call of Duty that fans have spotted over the years.</a></p><p>Leslie also stressed that Treyarch's use of AI tools is for efforts that "help the team" but not as a means to "replace any of the fantastic team members" who are building content for Call of Duty.</p><h2><strong>What other developers think of AI</strong></h2><p>A survey of game developers globally found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">a majority of studios are using AI technologies to build games, despite concerns from workers.</a> Recently, Embark's popular PvPvE game Arc Raiders caused a stir in some circles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">regarding its use of AI voice lines.</a> Call of Duty's main competitor in the FPS space, Battlefield, returned this year with Battlefield 6, and the developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">did not use generative AI.</a> However, a top Battlefield boss said EA's development teams use generative AI in the early development cycle, and the tools are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">"very seducing."</a></p><p>AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>Microsoft recently laid off thousands, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">including deep cuts at Xbox</a>. One affected studio was Candy Crush developer King, with some affected staff saying <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they were replaced by the AI tools they helped design.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>
