                <p dir="ltr">A small update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is the Gunsmith's new Blueprint Swap feature that allows players further weapon customization. The update also nerfs a few popular weapons in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players now have more freedom with weapon customization. The Gunsmith's new Blueprint Swap feature allows players to mix-and-match which attachment skins they have equipped or fine-tune how weapon blueprint skins apply to their builds. This means players can now customize any Black Ops 6 base weapon or blueprint with a skin they've unlocked or purchased. Additionally, weapon blueprints can now be customized further by adding skins to each existing attachment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4490257-bo6-season-03-announcement-038.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4490257-bo6-season-03-announcement-038.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490257"></a><figcaption>The Gunsmith's new Blueprint Swap feature </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4490257-bo6-season-03-announcement-038.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This new feature is available across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone, but it's only available to use with Black Ops 6 weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side of the update, adjustments are included for some of the battle royale's most popular guns. The maximum damage of the AK-74 assault rifle is reduced from 45 down to 39, and the CR-56 AMAX assault rifle has a slight reduction to its headshot multiplier, sprint-to-fire speed, and aim-down-sight move speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The HDR sniper has a massive reduction to the gun's Flinch Resistance which is now reduced by 60%. Additionally, the flinch resistance benefit of the Heavy Stock attachment is reduced from 60% to 35%, and the flinch resistance benefit of the Combat Stock is lowered from 25% to 15%.</p><p dir="ltr">While many long-range options were nerfed in Warzone, the Krig C assault did receive several small improvements to make the gun a viable option.</p><p dir="ltr">These Krig C changes include the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Medium damage range 1 increased from 32 to 33</li><li dir="ltr">Headshot multiplier increased from 1.2x to 1.35x</li><li dir="ltr">Bullet velocity increased from 820m/s to 830m/s</li><li dir="ltr">Aim-down-sight speed slowed from 260ms to 280ms</li><li dir="ltr">Sustained fire recoil improved</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the patch notes addresses the recent server disconnect issues in Warzone, saying that the developer is investigating the problem which arrived with the Season 3 Reloaded update. "We understand the frustration caused by ongoing server disconnects and want to clarify that these issues are not due to known malicious attacks or activity," the developer says. "Our studio teams are actively investigating the root cause which shipped with Season 3 Reloaded and will provide updates as soon as possible."</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-reloaded-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new update, Activision also detailed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-details-call-of-duty-anti-cheat-effectiveness-and-new-updates/1100-6531361/" data-ref-id="1100-6531361">effectiveness of the Call of Duty's anti-cheat</a> since Season 3 started.

Here are the anti-cheat results Activision provided, plus the new Ricochet improvements announced for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has been shutting down cheat makers since Black Ops 6's launch. Now, five more cheat makers have been put out of business since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/">anti-cheat report provided in March</a>. Cheat makers aren't the only ones in trouble. Activision is also targeting third-party hardware with scripts used to cheat, delivering cease and desist demands to several companies that create and sell these products.</p>

"However, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code." It also reminds players that any account using these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of Call of Duty's protection plan included the recent Account Linking policy change, which requires players to verify they are in control of an account when attempting to link a new PC account to an Activision ID. The publisher says this has already protected over 10,000 accounts that had a "potential suspicious account link" but were blocked by the new verification requirement.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-adds-4-20-events-and-major-updates-to-verdansk/2900-6513/">Season 3 Reloaded update</a> included even more improvements from Call of Duty's anti-cheat team. This added an expanded version of the Death Widget UI, which now provides players with even more detailed information about how they were eliminated, including if they were pinged by a heartbeat sensor, a Most Wanted contract, a proximity alarm, a Resurgence mark, or even by a teammate being used as a body shield. The Death Widget was recently added to Call of Duty in an attempt to cut down on false reports of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ricochet team also made updates to its advanced video replay technology to help better weed out wallhackers. Activision says this method uses clips captured by Call of Duty's Replay Investigation Tool, which is an internal tool that watches completed matches to determine the probability of suspicious gameplay using machine learning. If a clip gets marked by the tool as being suspect, it will then be reviewed by a human.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher says the Replay Investigation Tool captures tons of clips across Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but the tool is most focused on Ranked Play modes. "It's unbelievably frustrating to be bumped off a leaderboard by a cheater, but RIT and its advancements are zeroed in on the Ranked Play experience," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says new Ricochet anti-cheat updates are being developed and deployed on a regular basis, and more information will be provided in future blogs.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to fighting cheaters, Call of Duty is embracing stoner culture with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-seth-rogen-and-all-high-art-event-rewards/2900-6521/">a 4/20 event themed around Seth Rogen</a>, bundles for Jay and Silent Bob, and plenty of weed-related cosmetics to earn.</p>

                <p>When Blizzard announced a Berserk crossover for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, the franchise's first-ever external IP collaboration, it was hard not to be excited. The late Kentaro Miura's legendary manga series is a seminal work whose influence can be seen in any game with oversized swords and a penchant for over-the-top violence. The two franchises are both steeped in blood, gore, and demons--practically making them a match made in dark fantasy heaven.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Diablo 4's Berserk crossover is largely a disappointment, one that doesn't capitalize on the overlap between its two franchises. Far from honoring Berserk, it mostly just feels like a cash grab, an excuse for players to potentially spend well over $100 on cosmetics and nothing more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Full Animated Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/">Diablo 4's Berserk crossover</a>, which is live now until June 3, is broken down into two parts. One is the free set of rewards tied to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/">Diablo 4's new Reliquary battle pass system</a>. Elite enemies have a chance to drop Behelits, which can then be used to unlock a handful of freebies in the Berserk Reliquary. The rewards include a Brand of Sacrifice death marker and tattoo, as well as a cosmetic backpiece and mount trophy. Unlocking the four rewards then unlocks a free Berserk-themed nameplate. Players will need 400 hundred Behelits to acquire all of the rewards, and while that won't take too long (at max level, players are killing elite enemies by the dozen at any given moment), it does still feel like a grind without any real depth or strategy. It's just busy work.</p><p dir="ltr">The real bulk of the crossover is in the in-game shop. Blizzard is offering four different armor sets, along with a pet bundle, for 2,800 Platinum (Diablo 4's premium currency) each. A mount bundle is also available for 2,500. Even factoring in the "free" bonus Platinum included in the larger bundles on the in-game shop, buying all of the event's cosmetics comes out to over $120.</p><p dir="ltr">That is a whole lot of cash. Pricey cosmetics are nothing new (Blizzard has been selling various cosmetics in Diablo 4 for around the same price since the game's launch), but it feels especially egregious here. All of the items a player would most want, particularly Guts' iconic Berserker armor and Dragon Slayer sword, are locked behind a pricey paywall. Combined with the fact that this is the first season Blizzard is only offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/">200 Platinum, down from 700, in the Diablo 4 battle pass</a>, and the excitement around this collab has withered faster than Griffith locked in a dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be so bad if there was more for players not keen on spending money to do and unlock. The cosmetic armor sets themselves are meticulously detailed and look fantastic--Blizzard's artists have done great work recreating Miura's legendary designs in-game. Skull Knight and the Berserker armor in particular look incredible, though it would have been nice to see Berserk's most prominent heroine, Casca, featured in the cosmetic armor set lineup as well. The real issue here is that with the actual in-game event being practically non-existent and the free rewards being so disappointing, the entire crossover, the first in the franchise's history outside one with Blizzard's own Warcraft universe, just feels like a Dragon Slayer-sized missed opportunity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490200" data-ratio="0.5626423690205" data-width="1756" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490200"></a><figcaption>All of Diablo 4's Berserk premium cosmetics.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What's even stranger is one doesn't even have to look far to see what could have been. As mentioned earlier, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's free-to-play mobile game, is also crossing over with Berserk. The approach of the two games couldn't be more different.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal's Berserk crossover includes not only new cosmetics, but actual, exciting in-game events. It features a boss battle against the menacing Nosferatu Zodd alongside unique rewards. It introduces a new Behelit-themed Legendary gem that grants players new powers and mechanics to play around. Players can even try to survive the most infamous moment in all of Berserk, the Eclipse, one where armies of demons descend on players hoping to turn them into sacrifices to dark gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Why this level of creativity is found in the free-to-play Diablo Immortal and not Diablo 4 is anyone's guess. The Dragon Slayer appearing in Diablo 4 as a Legendary or Unique item could have been an exciting addition, one that might have changed up the game's meta in a potentially fun and exciting way. A limited-time in-game event where players are marked with the Brand of Sacrifice and have to fight to survive would be right at home in Blizzard's premium ARPG. Heck, just reskin Diablo 4's endgame Infernal Hordes activity, rename it Eclipse-mode, and call it a day. It would, at least, be something.</p><p dir="ltr">Is Blizzard's Diablo 4 team stretched so thin that having enemies occasionally drop yet another currency is all it could come up with for its first ever crossover? Players have complained about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/">Diablo 4's upcoming content roadmap</a> and how it seems lacking. The fact that there is so little to Diablo 4's Berserk crossover just seems to prove the point. There is no meat or substance here. Far from making players excited about Diablo 4, it sours the idea of future crossovers, which just so happens to be one of the few things potentially worth getting excited about listed on the game's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">It remains to be seen what IP Diablo 4 will cross over with next or what it will entail; according to the roadmap, it will come between September and December of this year. But Blizzard's lack of effort and creativity here doesn't inspire much confidence. Berserk and Diablo 4 should have been a perfect pairing. Instead, it's just a reminder of what these IP collabs often are--a chance to make a buck.</p>

Players start in a cabin and are tasked with surviving a several kilometers trek across the map to reach a weather tower. Along the way players will need to manage their body temperature, hunger, and hydration, with a heavy emphasis being put on a player's ability to stay warm.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those interested in participating in the Go Wayback! closed beta can sign-up on the official PlayerUnknown Productions <a href="https://discord.com/invite/playerunknownproductions?utm_campaign=PLAYERUNKNOWN+Productions+Launch+Closed+Beta+for+Prologue%3A+Go+Wayback%21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/prologue-go-wayback-brendan-greene-interview?utm_campaign=PLAYERUNKNOWN+Productions+Launch+Closed+Beta+for+Prologue%3A+Go+Wayback%21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, PlayerUknown himself, Brendan Greene, said that unlike most other survival games, Go Wayback! emphasizes body temperature as a key factor of survival. For that reason the game features a robust fire simulation, where players will need to pile together kindling and spark a flame to create fire as opposed to simply selecting "campfire" from a crafting menu. Objects that seem burnable in the game, even items in the cabin like books and drink coasters, probably are, giving players freedom in how to approach the game's survival situations.</p><p dir="ltr">While a game in its own right (one that will launch in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>), Go Wayback! is also a testbed for a larger, more ambitious game PlayerUnknown Productions calls Project Artemis. It's a currently more ephemeral idea that Greene describes as a blend of Minecraft and "3D version of the internet" where players will be able to create worlds, towns, and cities and have thousands of other players populate them.</p><p dir="ltr">Go Wayback! serves as a systemic foundation for Project Artemis. A playable engine showcase called Preface released for free last year and shows off the planet-generating tech that will power Artemis. A currently untitled game, one that Greene describes as "Command &amp; Conquer but first-person" and with tens or hundreds of players, will come next and also serve as a component of what will ultimately become Artemis.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Go Wayback! itself, Greene was heavily inspired by the popular survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rust/" data-ref-id="5000-222021">Rust</a> and its emergent gameplay. Scott Davidson, Rust's former art director, now works as Go Wayback's creative director. Though Go Wayback! is currently a single-player experience, Greene said he does want to eventually add co-op multiplayer. The team is currently estimating the game will be in early access for around two years.</p>

                <p>La Quimera, the story-driven FPS from the developers formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, was recently delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145"><em>after </em>reviews for the game went live</a>, and now the developers have reverted the game to early access instead of a 1.0 launch. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">out now on Steam Early Access for $30.</a></p><p>Reburn CEO Dmytro Lymar said in a statement, "Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds."</p><p>As with other early access titles, La Quimera will grow and evolve over time with future updates, the developer said. When the game was originally delayed, the developer said it encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145">"some unforeseen challenges"</a> related to La Quimera being the company's first title as an independent studio.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-OBrFTGwWI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n-OBrFTGwWI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game is set in the year 2064, a time when most nation states are extinct due to human and natural disasters that caused the collapse of global systems. Against this backdrop, private military companies are thriving, with players taking on the role of a PMC operative fighting through Latin America and battling against other factions.</p><p>The story was created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive and Only God Forgives) and E.J.A. Warren.</p><h2>La Quimera screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449822,1300-4449823,1300-4449824,1300-4449825,1300-4449826,1300-4449827,1300-4449828,1300-4449829,1300-4449830,1300-4449831,1300-4449832,1300-4449833,1300-4449834,1300-4449835" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"></figure><p>Reburn is made up of developers who previously worked on the Metro series, which consisted of adaptations of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro books.

                <p dir="ltr">The odds of an Xbox-branded handheld arriving this year look like they're increasing. That's because images have leaked of the ROG Ally 2, with one version sporting an Xbox button and better specs, according to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>. This would confirm reports from earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">Microsoft was partnering with Asus on a portable device</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, user Huang514 posted pictures of two different variations of the ROG Ally 2. The black version is supposedly the Xbox-branded edition of the hardware, apparently boasting an eight-core AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and 64GB of memory. The images were discoverable after <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" rel="nofollow ">website 91mobiles</a> spotted Indonesian certification office entries for the devices from Asus. Keep in mind that <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" rel="nofollow ">the official Xbox account on X</a> teased a collaboration with Asus in March, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This all certainly sounds like project Kennan. In addition, in possibly a happenstance moment, The Verge's Tom Warren noted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3lollkmjcic2f" rel="nofollow ">on BlueSky</a> that the Xbox app on PC just received an update that adds battery status and Wi-Fi signal icons for the compact mode. These newly implemented features certainly seem relevant in light of the leaked images.  </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-specs-reveal-a-powerful-new-steam-deck-competitor/1100-6513495/">The ROG Ally launched</a> in mid-2023 and became a Steam Deck competitor. Last year, Asus delivered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rog-ally-x-handheld-is-a-mid-gen-refresh/1100-6523336/">a mid-generation refresh with the ROG Ally X</a>, sporting a bigger battery and more RAM. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">it's believed Microsoft is working internally on its own Xbox handheld</a> that could come out in 2027 along with a new home console.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be intriguing for this apparent Xbox edition of the ROG Ally 2 relates to the handheld's price tag. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft just raised Xbox Series X|S console prices</a>--Series X now costs $600--and stated that select first-party games will retail for $80 this holiday season.</p>
