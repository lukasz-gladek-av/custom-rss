                <p>Celeste developer Extremely Ok Games has announced that its next project, Earthblade, has been canceled. The decision was made back in December, but the the team said it needed to process the news before announcing it publicly.</p><p>Director Maddy Thorson provided more details in a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">final blog post</a>. One of the main reasons for the cancelation revolved around disagreements over the Celeste IP rights, the details of which the studio has decided not to disclose. While a resolution was reached, founding member Pedro Medeiros parted ways with Earthblade in <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">November</a> and is now working on his own game, Neverway.</p><p>Medeiros's departure led Thorson and programmer Noel Berry to reevaluate Earthblade, which was still promising but not as far along considering its long development period.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298" data-ratio="0.96611445783133" data-width="1328" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298"></a><figcaption>Thorson left a parting gift for Earthblade: its earliest piece of concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png"></figure><p>"Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting," Thorson explained. "Pedro isn't to blame for this--in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p><p>The situation has caused other developers on Earthblade to leave as well, with both Thorson and Berry now working on smaller scale projects and prototyping again. Thorson admitted that scaling the team up after Celeste's success was a failure, but is hopeful that the studio will regain its footing and learn lessons from Earthblade's development.</p><p>Earthblade was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-developers-reveal-new-exploration-action-game-earthblade/1100-6490315/" data-ref-id="1100-6490315">revealed back in 2021,</a> and was slated for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-developers-next-game-earthblade-delayed-out-of-this-year/1100-6522269/" data-ref-id="1100-6522269">2024 release</a>. However, it was delayed out of that year with no further updates until now.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the line between handheld and home consoles blurs there's been more of a need--and want--for docks that can bridge the gap between small and big screen gaming. For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices. Everything from beefy hardware like the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-extreme-gets-200-discount-comes-with-free-travel-case/1100-6524126/" data-ref-id="1100-6524126">Asus ROG Ally</a> to comparatively modestly powered emulation handhelds like Anbernic's various devices are capable of being plugged into a large screen for a more traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Docks, then, are almost essential these days. Beyond functionality, I look for the aesthetic advantage a dock can provide. I like my devices nicely placed and positioned as something that looks good in a room, instead of just hanging out near a power outlet while on charge. With that in mind, my docks of choice have always come from JSAUX, which offers the ability to turn the Steam Deck, Ally, and any other PC-handheld into something that can actually function as a computer. Along with a HDMI out and few USB ports to connect peripherals to, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Charging-Deck-HB0603/dp/B0B7HVZNMB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSAUX docks</a> include an ethernet port, making both working and gaming with good internet stability much more viable.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Handheld Dock Chroma</a> isn't very different from these, despite being more expensive at $80. However, it does address a couple of key issues I always have with docks. The first of these is docks aren't typically very nice to look at and the second being the stability can often be an issue. Razer sent over a dock for testing; I've been using it for about a week and, as a whole, I'm impressed with it as an overall package. It doesn't do anything unique, but it does offer everything you would want and need from a hardware and connectivity standpoint while also being designed in a thoughtful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Steam Deck</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432291,1300-4432292,1300-4432293,1300-4432294,1300-4432295,1300-4432296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First and foremost, those looking to use the Handheld Dock Chroma as more than just a charging device with HDMI out capabilities will be able to make the most of the three USB 3.2 and/or the USB Type C ports to plug in keyboard, mice, controllers or anything else that's required to make a PC-handheld function as a desktop computer. There's a HDMI port that supports 4K at 60hz for external screens, and a gigabit ethernet port. There's also 100w passthrough for power. Again, it's mostly standard features and available in both JSAUX's docks and Valve's official dock for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">However, where Razer's dock stands out is the mechanism used to hold devices in place. It's a back plate that covers the rear of most devices and provides good support and prevents any wobbling or tipping. This might sound like a simple thing that isn't really a big deal but, for me, I've always disliked the way the JSAUX and Valve docks I've used don't have a back and rely on how the base is shaped to keep devices in place. These all function perfectly fine for most people who don't really think about it, but I always felt my devices were somewhat precariously placed.</p><p dir="ltr">The back plate design Razer has used gives me much more confidence and, better still, it's adjustable so the angle at which your device is placed can be changed. The backplate can be raised and angled to fit into rubber grooves in the base to lend further stability, but also better accommodate a range of devices. Like other stands, the USB connector that plugs into your device has a goose neck design, so you're limited by how far it can extend, but most gaming devices, phones, and tablets should be able to settle in without issue. I have taken to positioning the back plate at its steepest angle and then placing my ROG Ally X on it for a viewing angle that is much more comfortable on a desk. Adjusting the placement also means that there's a variety of viewing angles available, which is handy if you want people to crowd around a single device for multiplayer (I ain't doing that).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289" data-ratio="0.41683501683502" data-width="1485" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Asus ROG Ally</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not in use, the back plate can be flattened horizontally to serve as a top surface, giving the dock a box-like form factor that makes it much easier to transport. While most docks are lightweight enough to throw in a bag and take with you, the flat, rectangular design makes it much easier to place in sleeves and pockets in bags without worrying if it's scratching something else or being crushed by other things. It also makes it easier to take out and put in. The aluminium chassis makes it feel lightweight and sturdy, and matte black texturing means it can easily blend into most setups. Of course, there's also a button that you can hit to activate and cycle through RGB lighting options on the bottom of the base. It's worth noting that the package only includes the dock--so it's up to you to provide the power source.</p><p dir="ltr">All that means that the Razer Handheld Dock is a dock that I feel good about having, instead of something that just does the job. It's a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it's easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it's on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Disclosure: Razer provided the Handheld Chroma Dock to GameSpot for testing.</em></p>

what exactly it counts in this engagement metric. While Dragon Age: The Veilguard's underperformance disappointed the company, EA claims that a "majority of the change" in net bookings comes from Global Football--and more specifically, the release of EA Sports FC 25--not meeting expectations during Q3.</p><p>EA did not share specific player engagement numbers for EA Sports FC 25, simply explaining that it underperformed following two years of growth for the franchise. EA appears to have faith in the recovery of its Global Football efforts, with Andrew Wilson praising EA Sports FC 25's recent Team of the Year update.</p><p>Both Dragon Age: The Veilguard and EA Sports FC 25 received generally favorable reviews from critics, sitting at aggregated <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scores of 82</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76 on Metacritic</a>, respectively.</p><p>We'll learn more about the implications of each game's underperformance when EA holds a conference call about its Q3 financial results on February 4. If you want to play the games in question for yourself, EA Sports FC 25 is available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard is on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.</p>

                <p>Several popular gaming-related subreddits are banning posts that link to social media site X (formerly Twitter). Among those issuing the ban are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1i7f9br/rsteamdeck_will_no_longer_allow_links_to_x/?share_id=iV0qYi-9g5id_e-aHsrW9&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/SteamDeck</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1i7ideu/x_twitter_links_are_banned_from_rmonsterhunter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/MonsterHunter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1i7ivkr/posts_linking_to_twitterx_are_now_banned_in_rwow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/WOW</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/PCGaming,</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1i73hne/rnintendo_joins_other_subreddits_in_banning_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Nintendo</a>.</p><p>These bans are part of a larger movement on Reddit to ban X content. Since the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/2025/01/22/x-ban-spreads-across-reddit-as-communities-react-to-musks-gesture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">influx of blacklisting</a> began, there have been a number of posts made across various subreddits raising the question of if the respective subreddit should follow suit. Currently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1i6y5cw/should_rhalo_ban_or_restrict_xtwitter_posts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1i7d4mj/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/RPG</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/1i6ozcd/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Valorant</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1i7c49p/proposal_to_ban_x_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/AnimalCrossing</a>, and several other prominent subreddits are in discussions, with the majority of subscribers currently in favor of a prohibiting content pulled from X. The extent of the bans vary from subreddit to subreddit, with r/Nintendo and r/SteamDeck allowing screenshots while r/WOW is prohibiting images as well.</p><p>The official reasons for the ban vary, though many cite Elon Musk's recent actions as the primary motivation. Musk, who owns X, recently attended President Trump's inauguration and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was seen doing a Nazi-like salute</a>. However, different forums have also cited X's lack of moderation and "increasingly hateful" content as reason to blacklist the website.</p><p>"This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now," r/PCGaming moderator Shock4ndAwe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently."</p><p>r/WOW, a World of Warcraft forum boasting over 3 million members, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1i6mjqc/rmagictcg_and_the_website_formerly_known_as/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> that a combination of "recent political events" and X's declining reliability as a news source contributed to its decision. r/MagicTCG, a subreddit dedicated to Magic the Gathering, confirmed that its users were "overwhelmingly in favor" of a ban due to "Nazi behavior from the owner."</p><p>Though some news outlets and citizens continue to debate if Musk's gesture was a Nazi salute, German and Jewish communities alike have expressed their belief that the gesture was antisemitic. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, condemned Musk, stating that while "everyone can say what he wants, even if he is a billionaire, what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions."</p>

                <p>The first teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> confirmed what fans had long suspected by depicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri as the game's new lead character</a>. Through the first three games, voice actor Doug Cockle portrayed the previous main character, Geralt of Rivia, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">he will reprise his role in the sequel</a> as well. But Cockle is far from disappointed about taking a backseat this time, and he's eager to see Ciri get the spotlight.</p><p>"I'm really excited," Cockle told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because... I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."</p><p>Cockle also related that CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">gently admonished him</a> for sharing his theories about Geralt's presence in the game.</p><p>"I was never really out of their good books," said Cockle. "All developers are like this. They want to keep their surprises and I actually didn't know anything, so I was just making guesses at things and stuff like that. And probably one of their requests was to just to stop guessing, 'Doug, you might be right. You might not be right. It doesn't matter if you are talking me. Doug, who plays Geralt, whatever you say is going to be taken as something.' So it was a very, very light slap on the wrist. It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p>Cockle is reprising his role as Geralt in Netflix's upcoming animated film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-faces-a-war-between-the-land-and-the-sea-in-the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep/1100-6528810/" data-ref-id="1100-6528810">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>. That will premiere on Netflix on February 11, while The Witcher Season 4 is expected to arrive later this year. As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">ramped up production</a> at the end of 2024, and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/age-of-pirates-captain-blood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Development on Captain Blood</a> reportedly began as far back as 2003, as Russian developer Akella planned to make a game based on a novel by author Rafael Sabatini. A game titled Captain Blood was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/22/1c-announces-e3-line-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased at E3 2004</a>, but it switched teams and restarted development multiple times before the project settled with publisher 1C Company around 2008. GameSpot even went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-blood-hands-on/1100-6192241/" data-ref-id="1100-6192241">hands-on with Captain Blood</a> around this time, already lamenting that it had "been in development for several years now." While a release was supposed to happen by 2010, it kept getting delayed and ended up never releasing due to parties involved with the game going bankrupt and other legal challenges surrounding the game.</p><p>All of that meant Captain Blood was left stuck in development hell after 2010...until now. In 2024, video game publisher SNEG Ltd. acquired the rights to Captain Blood and began working on an offical release. After one last small delay from late 2024 to 2025, we finally have a concrete release date for this action-adventure game. While we have no idea whether or not the game itself is any good, it's impressive that a game that seemed cursed to never release is finally coming out.</p><p>Captain Blood launches for PC, Steam, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 6, priced at $25.</p>
