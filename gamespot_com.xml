                <p>The world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is about to get bigger again with the upcoming expansion pack Adventure Awaits. And while tropical getaways and summer camp experiences are the focus of this pack, it's also bringing back imaginary friends from The Sims 3. You can see one of the imaginary friends in the first trailer for Adventure Awaits, as well as an extended glimpse at your Sims vacation options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aS0NxrRJm6I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Adventure Awaits doesn't just cater to adult sims. Child sims are also given the chance to have formative moments as they discover archery, diving, papercraft, and other camp activities. As for the imaginary friends, they will appear as four different dolls with a handful of personality types: Goofball, creative, competitive, and evil. Picking the evil option seems unnecessarily risky, but it's your Sim life and you get to make all of the bad decisions you want.</p><p>There are three Gibbi Point vacation neighborhoods included in this pack, including Camp Gibbi Gibbi in the Wanderwood Wilds. There are so many camp activities for children and adult sims that the only thing it's missing is Jason Voorhees to menace the camp attendees. The other neighborhoods in the pack are Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction.</p><p>Each neighborhood has its own exclusive activities, and adult sims can take up everything from kayaking to fishing for jellyfish. Players also have the option of turning their sims into park workers as either camp counselors or park rangers. If none of those vacation getaways appeal to you, players can build their own custom resorts. EA has also teamed up with Sims custom creators Jeyjeybink, daniellebuilds, Gryphi, KiwiSimsKate, and Axiisims, all of whom created their own unique experiences for fans to sample.</p><p>A gameplay trailer for The Sims 4 Adventure Awaits will debut on September 10. The expansion itself will follow on October 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
