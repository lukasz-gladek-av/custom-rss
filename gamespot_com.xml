                <p>There are few unmade video games more famous than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> and its beloved Playable Trailer. Although P.T. is now very hard to find since Konami took it offline, an instructor in Japan is using it as a tool to teach students how to speak English.</p><p>Tsunan Secondary School in Niigata Prefecture <a href="https://tsunan-ss-edu.note.jp/n/n831cfb652bdc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a blog entry</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-secondary-school-students-learn-english-by-playing-hideo-kojimas-p-t-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that demonstrated how an assistant language teacher utilized P.T. in class as a learning tool. Students were invited to play through P.T. in English, while other members of the class would get to weigh in on what the player should do next by using English phrases.</p><p>The blog noted that alarmingly loud ringing telephone from P.T. startled the fifth-year students, who are roughly the same age as high school sophomores. But this is one of the most novel ways to learn another language. It's impressive they have the game at all considering that the only easy way to play it is with PlayStation 4 consoles that downloaded it before P.T. was taken down.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, director Guillermo del Toro, and actor Norman Reedus were lined up to collaborate on Silent Hills before Konami pulled the plug on the project. Kojima subsequently left the company and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a>, which featured Reedus in a leading role and del Toro in a cameo appearance. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, was released earlier this year.</p><p>Kojima is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, an upcoming horror game with director Jordan Peele. One of the first trailers for OD appeared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/od-trailer-seems-to-contain-silent-hills-reference/1100-6519914/" data-ref-id="1100-6519914">feature a Silent Hills callback</a>. A more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">OD teaser trailer</a> was also very reminiscent of P.T., and Kojima subsequently stated that he had to make sure that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-had-to-make-sure-that-od-wasnt-haunted-by-a-real-ghost/1100-6534991/" data-ref-id="1100-6534991">he hadn't captured a real ghost</a> while he was visiting locations for the game. OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it's being produced by Xbox Game Studio in conjunction with Kojima Productions. Actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier are lending their likenesses and voices to the game.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> has posted some impressive numbers since launch, but right now, it looks like the game has some competition. While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won't be out until next month, indie eggs-traction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> is busy climbing the charts on Steam. For a brief time, the viral indie game had 152,207 concurrent players, beating Battlefield 6 during that time period with its concurrent-player count of 129,729 players.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, Escape From Duckov outshone Battlefield 6 during that period before the current Steam status quo reasserted itself. The game has proven to be a big hit with players since launch, and what makes the achievement even more impressive is that the duck-themed parody of Escape From Tarkov is the product of the five-person team known as Team Soda. At the time of writing, Escape From Duckov has peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/" rel="nofollow ">257,952 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlefield Studios made the battle royale game available to testers in the Battlefield Labs program, and now the studio is addressing feedback. The updates include an adjustment to time-to-kill values at close range, along with armor changes (everyone can hold two armor plates now), bug fixes and lighting improvements, and vehicle-balance changes. Here is a rundown, as written by the developer:</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>Beyond all of this, Battlefield Studios said it has been working to unlock "smoother performance overall" for the battle royale game. "We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn't have done without our players' involvement in the tests," the developer said.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has confirmed it's working on a battle royale mode for Battlefield 6 but has not shared much in the way of specifics about it yet, including whether it will be free or paid. Footage of the game has leaked out of the Battlefield Labs tests, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-footage-leaks/1100-6534689/" data-ref-id="1100-6534689">showing off a first look at gameplay.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a great start earlier this month, selling 7 million copies out of the gate for the "biggest opening" ever for the FPS series. The game is set to grow with the debut of Season 1 on October 28, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">adds new maps and modes</a>, along with battle royale, if the reports are true.</p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2</a> fans finally can take their journey through the Underworld on the go on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-release-times-revealed-for-switch-2-and-pc/1100-6534925/" data-ref-id="1100-6534925">Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</a>, the battle continues on PC with the release of the first Post-Launch Patch 1 Preview for the game. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supergiant Games said it is grateful for all the community feedback</a> since the v1 Launch, and those reports have directly inspired a host of new enhancements, most notably to the narrative's True Ending. This preview is now available to brave players who want to jump in early, offering a significant update to Boons, foes, and getting to the heart of Melinoe's quest.</p><p>In Hades 2, players step into the role of Melinoe, the sister of the first game's protagonist, Zagreus, on a quest to defeat the titan Chronos, who has overthrown her family's domain. Melinoe's journey is guided by her mentor, Hecate, and supported by a cast of new and returning gods. While the game maintains the same fast-paced action of its predecessor, it introduces a key mechanical shift: Melinoe is less reliant on dashing and more on a new sprint ability, which can be upgraded with boons and even used offensively to encourage a fresh approach to combat. You can check out GameSpot's review here, where we gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">a perfect 10/10 score</a>.</p><p>The most significant changes in this preview focus on the game's late-stage narrative, with major enhancements to the True Ending. This includes new events both leading up to and following the ending, increasing the number of Underworld clears required, and revising key True Ending scenes. To help players revisit these moments, a new Cauldron Incantation has been added that lets you return to an earlier point in the story. Beyond the story, players will see a general balance pass to various Boons, Aspects, and Daedalus Hammer Upgrades, along with a Crossroads Renewal that reduces the Kudos cost of many decorative items, refunding any excess Kudos you've already spent.</p><h4>True Ending &amp; Narrative Enhancements:</h4><ul><li>Added new events in the lead-up to and after the True Ending.</li><li>Increased the number of Underworld clears required to achieve the True Ending.</li><li>Added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. (Note: Changes are primarily to the Underworld route; the Surface route is largely unchanged.)</li><li>Art and dialog have been updated with new artwork, animations, and voice lines for characters such as Chronos, Zagreus, Hecate, and Hades, to support these new events.</li><li>Returning to a Real Possibility: A new Cauldron Incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story so you can re-experience the True Ending.</li><li>Fated Prophecy Adjustments: Some character-related Prophecies, including the story epilogue one, should now unfold faster than before.</li><li>Fated List of Minor Prophecies: Priority of key events increased for: Melinoe, Help Us, Silk and Spitefulness, and Voice and Vanity. Born to Win is revealed sooner, and the requirements for Denier of Suitors are reduced.</li></ul><h4>Combat and Balance Changes:</h4><ul><li>Witch's Staff (Circe): Smolder Ring (Hestia) now also applies Scorch from the bonus Cast when your Casts overlap.</li><li>Boons and Blessings: Increases to damage/effectiveness for: Anvil Ring (Hephaestus), Controlled Burn (Hestia), Sword Ring (Ares), Carnal Pleasure (Ares x Aphrodite), Shadow Pounce (Artemis), Life Tax (Hades), Last Gasp (Hades), and Fight Fight Fight (Echo).</li><li>Ares: Increased Plasma pickup range.</li><li>Success Rate (Hermes): Now affects Nurture of Hera (Selene x Hera).</li><li>Gigaros Dash (Hades): No longer staggers foes when dealing direct damage.</li><li>Life Tax (Hades): Restorative effect is no longer reduced by Vow of Scars (Oath).</li><li>Daedalus Hammer Upgrades:</li><li>Increased damage for Elephant Rockets (Coat - Shiva) and Chakra Collider (Coat - Shiva).</li></ul><h4>Foes &amp; Dangers:</h4><ul><li>Adjusted hitboxes for Unrivaled Prometheus (Heracles attacks) and Headmistress Hecate (flame attacks).</li><li>Phantom (Fields): Reduced effectiveness and removed the Life-drain effect from some attacks.</li></ul><h4>Crossroads &amp; Economy:</h4><ul><li>Crossroads Renewal: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos. Excess Kudos already spent will be refunded.</li><li>Added Primordial Chaos theme to the Music Maker.</li><li>Crossroads Cauldron: Disintegration of Monstrosity--you are no longer required to cast this as soon as you can afford to.</li><li>Greatest Gift of Gaia: Reduced requirements for this to be revealed.</li><li>Keepsakes: Jeweled Pom (Hades &amp; Persephone)--bonus Hades blessing is no longer kept if you are not at the Fates' Whim; fixed an issue preventing it from granting Last Gasp (Hades).</li><li>Well of Charon: Yarn of Ariadne: Now also raises the chance of finding Duo Boons.</li><li>Mist Veil: Now restores Magick lost for any reason</li></ul><h4>Miscellaneous, bug fixes, and quality of life:</h4><ul><li>Special Encounters: Added a preview icon for Location exits leading to an Infernal Contract (after the True Ending), Nemesis can only show up once per night while battling through the Underworld, and Circe appears slightly more often.</li><li>Settings (New Options): Danger Pulse: New toggle to switch off the persistent flashing at critical Life levels. FPS Limit: New option to limit max fps while VSync is off.</li><li>Bug Fixes: Numerous fixes, including those for Argent Skull not firing reliably, various Boon and Keepsake interactions (e.g., Calling Card and Time Piece), collision issues, and visual/audio errors.</li></ul>

She's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-jennifer-hale-says-the-tv-show-would-be-genius-to-do-this-one-thing/1100-6528707/" data-ref-id="1100-6528707">expressed support for the TV series</a> that's in the works, saying she'd love to appear in it in some capacity. She's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JJLuJrPAg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed some of her favorite lines from the games</a>, including a hilariously silly line from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-2/" data-ref-id="5000-34111">Mass Effect 2</a>. She's even said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the original cast should return for the TV series</a>, but would welcome whatever BioWare ultimately decides to do. Hale holds a lot of adoration for both Mass Effect and FemShep, and as such, is calling on fans to let the Canadian developer know that they want her back.</p><p>"Everyone out there, the more you tell them what you want, maybe the likelier it is that it'll happen," she said.</p><p>Of course, it's all in BioWare's hands. Franchise veterans are working on the next Mass Effect game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5s-development-team-is-made-up-of-veterans-bioware-reminds-fans/1100-6522139/" data-ref-id="1100-6522139">according to BioWare</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-game-may-not-release-until-2029-report/1100-6519052/" data-ref-id="1100-6519052">reports suggest that it may not come out until 2029</a>. I guess that's a good thing, considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-wont-have-stylized-dragon-age-graphics-but-it-will-have-mature-tones/1100-6527443/" data-ref-id="1100-6527443">Mass Effect 5 will have a mature tone and less stylized graphics</a> than, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that BioWare is a subsidiary of EA, which was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion. Following this sale, which is one of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ea-electronic-arts-video-game-silver-lake-pif-d17dc7dd3412a990d2c0a6758aaa6900" rel="nofollow ">largest-ever private equity buyouts for any industry of all time</a>, there are concerns that BioWare could see some cuts under its new ownership, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO of Take-Two, has once again shared his thoughts on AI in the video game space, and he believes the technology is "great" but people are overstating what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/ai-is-a-combination-of-metadata-with-a-parlor-trick-take-two-boss-says-a-great-thing-for-business-but-its-not-creative-and-never-will-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a> that Zelnick said at the Paley International Council Summit this week that, "AI is a great thing" for "every industry," including video games. But it's not a magic wand.</p><p>"Will it recreate or create genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of compute with a language model attached," he said.</p><p>The executive added that AI will probably be able to help people work more efficiently, but AI is not a forward-looking technology that can actually do anything creative.</p><p>"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model," Zelnick said. "And by definition, a data set is what? Backward-looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward-looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what? A predictive model."</p><p>What's more, Zelnick pushed back on the claim that AI will lead to net losses in jobs, citing historical evidence to make his point. "In 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture. Today we make food for America and food for the rest of the world. And 2% of the workforce is involved with agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible, I can't get a job as a farmer,'" he said.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said the term "artificial intelligence" is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">oxymoron</a> because machines cannot learn. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>Zelnick also previously talked about how people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do.
