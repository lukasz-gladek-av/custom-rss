                <p>The next Hearthstone expansion is Into the Emerald Dream, exploring the magical spirit realm specialized by Druids. As you might expect, this is a very Druid-focused expansion, and for the first time each class will get its own cards that use the Druid's "Choose One" keyword, alongside a number of other new mechanics. Naturally, Druids will get their own special tools, as we can exclusively reveal the new class <strong>legendary minion Hamuul Runetotem</strong> and several of his support cards.</p><p>Hamuul Runetotem himself uses the new keyword <strong>Imbue</strong>, which will be available to Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, and Shaman. This keyword gives you a new Hero Power, which then upgrades as you play more Imbue cards. Some already-revealed Imbue cards take effect as Battlecry or Deathrattle effects, but Hamuul's takes effect as soon as the game starts, if you built your deck with only Nature spells. Then, it repeats the Imbue effect again for every two spells you cast during the game. It's a big, powerful effect as a trade-off for limiting your spell selection.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png" data-ref-id="1300-4448995,1300-4448996" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>The Hamuul Runetotem Druid Legendary, in Standard and Signature variants</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"></figure><p>Druid's upgraded Hero Power summons a 1/1 Plant Golem, but keep in mind, it will be upgrading each time you play two Nature spells, to a 2/2 Plant Golem, and then 3/3 and so on.

It has both a Battlecry and Deathrattle that makes your next Hero Power cost 0. Assuming you've imbued a few times by the time you play it, this 3-mana 3/3 minion essentially comes with two more big minions for free.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449039" data-ratio="1" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449039"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png"></figure><p>But of course, the big effect wouldn't mean much without spell support to build up your new hero power, and fortunately, Druid is getting plenty of that too. The <strong>Horn of Plenty</strong> is a Nature spell that discovers another Nature spell, making it enough for a full Imbue all by itself. <strong>Reforestation</strong> is similarly generous, letting you choose between drawing a spell or minion, or rewarding your patience by doing both if you hold it for three turns. Finally, <strong>Photosynthesis</strong> will help you stay alive by restoring 6 health, while also supplying you with three random Druid spells. The generated spells aren't necessarily Nature spells, but since they're Druid spells, they have a pretty good chance to help feed your Imbue effect.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449918,1300-4449919,1300-4449920,1300-4449921,1300-4449922,1300-4449923" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"></figure><p>For the Into the Emerald Dream expansion, each class gets its own Wild God legendary card, along with its own Choose One card for the Druid flavor.

A pre-purchase bundle is also available now, which includes 60 Emerald Dream packs, two legendary cards, and a Ysera card back, for $50. A mega bundle includes 80 packs, 10 golden packs, a signature Malorne the Waywatcher card, one random golden legendary card, four Tavern tickets, the Ysera card back, and a Druid hero skin for $80.</p>

While Activision and Tony Hawk himself are likely waiting for that day--which conspicuously happens to be 3/4-- to make their announcement, a rating has been issued for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remastered edition of two earlier games in the franchise.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-rated-in-singapore-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore <a href="https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/Classification/Search/VideoGames/SearchDetail.aspx?sTitle=IDX/2502/000036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has approved a rating</a> for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

The 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was in September 2024, and Hawk revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he had been in contact with Activision</a> about the occasion. Although no announcement was made at the time, Hawk assured THPS fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the franchise was far from over</a>.</p><p>An earlier report suggested that the next Tony Hawk game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">could launch as soon as this summer</a>, and that's definitely plausible given the timing of the announcement. We'll know more when Activision makes its official announcement on March 4.</p>

                <p>8BitDo has unveiled the Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for PC and Android, and the new pro-style gamepad is already ready to ship.

When synced wirelessly via the included USB-C dongle, the Ultimate 2 reportedly offers near-seamless input recognition with 1ms latency. The Ultimate 2 also has a polling rate of 1,000Hz when using 2.4GHz wireless or USB-C wired connections. To be clear, the original Ultimate offered a stable and fast wireless connection, but it sounds like the new model will be even better in this regard. It's also the first Ultimate Controller to use a USB-C dongle instead of USB-A. On Android, the Ultimate 2 syncs via Bluetooth.</p><p>8BitDo replaced the Hall Effect sticks found on many of its controllers with TMR sticks. Like Hall Effect sticks, TMR technology uses electromagnets to provide a smoother feel with more accurate, precise movements. Electromagnetic controls also mitigate the risk of analog stick drift. Though similar overall, TMR technology is typically viewed as an improvement compared to Hall Effect tech. The new analog sticks are accompanied by customizable RGB lighting rings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449942,1300-4449943,1300-4449944,1300-4449945,1300-4449946" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 2 is the first controller in the series to feature four extra buttons. 8BitDo essentially combined the designs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate</a> with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0DM1WH5BV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2C</a>, the manufacturer's latest budget wireless controller. It has two remappable back triggers (like the Ultimate) as well as two extra shoulder buttons (like the Ultimate 2C).</p><p>8BitDo also added another common pro-style customization feature to the Ultimate 2: trigger locks. The Hall Effect analog sticks can instantly convert to linear buttons by flicking the switches on the back.</p><p>In addition to the physical modifications, the Ultimate 2 supports 8BitDo's proprietary app on PC and Android. With Ultimate Software V2, you can create up to three profiles and make adjustments to stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivity, modify rumble intensity, and program analog stick dead zones.</p><p>Like 8BitDo's other premium controllers in its flagship series, the Ultimate 2 comes with a matching USB-C charging dock with a compartment to store the USB dongle. While it's unclear how much game time you can get from a full charge, the Ultimate 2's battery is substantially larger than the original's battery. The Ultimate 2 has a 1,000mAh battery, whereas the Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch each have 480mAh batteries. The original Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth offered 15 and 22 hours of battery life, respectively, so the new model may offer a marked improvement to those already solid figures.</p><p>The downside to the Ultimate 2 is that it's limited to PC and Android at the moment. The original Ultimate 2.4GHz Controller eventually became compatible with Apple devices, so it's possible that will happen down the line with the sequel, too. 8BitDo typically releases Nintendo Switch versions of its Ultimate Controllers, so we may get a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch</a>, which is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">best Nintendo Switch controller</a> designed by a third-party.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.
