                <p>Like most open-world games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will have its fair share of collectibles to hunt down. The catch here is that you'll need to really work to get your hands on collectible bobblehead replicas of everyone's refund-adverse arms dealer, Marcus, as these will be hidden away in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>As detailed by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, the idea for these collectibles came from the studio wanting to push the game's enhanced move-set to its very limits. Borderlands 4 has several new traversal options--including gliding, double-jumping, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/" data-ref-id="1100-6528427">and using a grapple-hook to move around areas</a>--and Gearbox wanted to reward players with a memento for reaching remote spots on the map.</p><p>"Graeme Timmons--Borderlands 4's creative director--got with some of our designers and other artists and engineers and decided that we needed something for players to find when they made their way to these remote or uninhabited areas," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944529531978858850" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>. "We wanted something of an icon. The same kind of thing in each spot, so players would <em>know</em> they found it. The item had to be simple, recognizable, have a feeling of being something one might collect--and ideally--having real connections to our universe."</p><p>This led to the Marcus bobblehead being chosen, and there's even an in-universe reason for these being on the isolationist planet of Kairos. As Pitchford noted, there are "well over 200" of these bobbleheads to collect, and he expects that most players will never see any of them. "A very, very small number of people will explore Kairos so completely that they might discover them all. Each has a story," Pitchford added, while also throwing down a gauntlet to players with the inclusion of a map showing off the locations of these collectibles.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944532238554812905" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">All in all, there are well over 200 Marcus Bobbleheads hidden around Kairos.

                <p>Considering the popularity of the John Wick films, there aren't a lot of video games that let players assume control of the legendary killer. Now, there's going to be one fewer because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/john-wick-hex-review-tick-tock-wick/1900-6417333/" data-ref-id="1900-6417333">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted later this week across PC and consoles.</p><p>Big Fan Games announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">John Wick Hex's Steam page</a>. The game is being delisted on July 17, but players who purchase it ahead of time will still be able to play their copies. Fans who own a physical copy of John Wick Hex will also continue to have access to this tactical action RPG.</p><p>The announcement didn't include a reason for the delisting, but it stands to reason that the John Wick rights may have simply run out for the title. John Wick Hex was originally published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, and it was released on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Good Shepherd's parent company, Devolver Digital, shifted the publishing rights for John Wick Hex to another one of its smaller companies, Big Fan Games, in 2024.</p><p>John Wick Hex is currently <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?irclickid=3NISJV1K-xycUhN0CIwuRwDlUksSc4S9QW9VXI0&amp;sharedid=&amp;irpid=1804712&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Fandom%20-%20Gamespot&amp;utm_content=1804712&amp;utm_term=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;irgwc=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on Humble Bundle for only $4</a>. The game is $20 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/john-wick-hex/9PB1C8S0922M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSN</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoreGxJLXrDI1iJgUHBgM7zKG_ts299vG96eJYjrdYaS6-jGZ0VP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Online</a>.</p><p>In 2022, Lionsgate acknowledged that it had fielded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-big-aaa-john-wick-video-game-could-happen-lionsgate-ceo-says/1100-6508901/" data-ref-id="1100-6508901">multiple proposals for a John Wick AAA game</a>. The studio confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-5-confirmed-john-wick-video-game-proposals-moving-ahead/1100-6514599/" data-ref-id="1100-6514599">discussions about another John Wick game</a> were still active in 2023, but nothing concrete has emerged. More recently, Ana de Armas reprised her role as Eve Macarro from the John Wick spinoff, Ballerina, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">to appear in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a> as a playable character.</p>
