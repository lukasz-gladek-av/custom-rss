                <p>November is upon us, and to celebrate, Fanatical has revealed its <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fmovember-game-stache-charity-bundle-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle</a>. Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.</p><p>As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">favorite co-op games</a>--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.</p><p>Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.</p><h2>Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Schedule I</li><li>Mon Bazou</li><li>Gloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Men of War 2</li><li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dusk (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Agent Intercept</li><li>Prodigal</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal.

                <p>ModRetro has announced two new games for its Chromatic Classics Collection. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-for-game-boy-gets-new-physical-edition-for-franchises-30th-anniversary/1100-6534930/">After releasing a brand-new version of Rayman for Game Boy Color</a> earlier this year, the company is celebrating Croc and GameStop's mascot, Buck the Bunny with new cartridge releases.</p><p>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition celebrates the cute little reptile's Game Boy Color adventure from 2000, and preorders will open on October 31--or Croctober 31 if you're a fan of the franchise--with a planned shipping date of December 2025. Priced at $45, the classic side-scrolling platformer features over 30 levels spread across four worlds. The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385"></a><figcaption>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg"></figure><p>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro. After the GameStop bunny picks up the titular cursed cartridge, he finds himself pulled into the game world and forced to fight for his life in this digital frontier. The game will feature multi-phase boss fights, upgradeable abilities, and even cheat codes. Priced at $45, it'll be available starting October 31. Both of these games will be available through the ModRetro store and GameStop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386"></a><figcaption>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg"></figure><p>One thing to note about these games is that even though they have ModRetro and Chromatic branding on them, they'll still work just fine on the original Nintendo hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">the ModRetro Chromatic launched not too long ago and we were very impressed</a> with just how faithfully it created and upgraded the Game Boy Color experience. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/">New stock of the modernized Game Boy also arrived earlier this year</a>, and you can choose between two models: a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass or a $300 version that's equipped with Sapphire Glass and extremely durable materials.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretros-n64-tribute-console-has-a-price-launches-later-this-year/1100-6533380/">ModRetro also announced a modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console</a> a few months back. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it does have an early-bird preorder price of $199.</p>

                <p>It seems that Square Enix is getting into the Halloween spirit and upping its fashion game. That would explain why the company behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> announced on October 31 that its long-running MMO would do away with class requirements for glamours, the game's equivalent of transmogrification.</p><p>In layman's terms, players can now use the appearance of any armor set regardless of their current class and job. That means that healers like white mages can now ditch their fancy robes and look like hulking dark knights--one of Final Fantasy 14's tank classes--and vice versa. Pandæmonium, indeed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fashion enjoyers, this one is for you!<br>From Patch 7.4 onward, you'll be able to equip any glamours regardless of your class/job! ✨<br>Mix and match your favorite outfits and slay on the battlefield! 💅 <a href="https://t.co/4WogdAbGM6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4WogdAbGM6</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In the past, Final Fantasy 14 has been fairly strict about jobs using armor that falls within their respective schools of equipment. For example, all tanking and healing jobs share gear, but things get much dicier in this regard when looking at DPS roles, especially ones that differ between ranged attack and melee. As such--as well as to differentiate players and give these jobs unique visual identities--many of these roles have exclusive weapon and armor sets.</p><p>Players are then free to turn armor and weapons that their job can use into glamours, allowing them to swap between appearances and aesthetics that they prefer while using gear that is functionally better. Now though, Square Enix is throwing open the doors to Final Fantasy 14's intense fashion-savvy crowd by getting rid of any restrictions and multiplying player's dress options tenfold.</p><p>The change, which seems to going over <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en.finalfantasyxiv.com/post/3m4ij6vvmes2z/quotes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceptionally well</a> with players, will be introduced in the forthcoming 7.4 patch, which releases on December 16. Patch 7.4, also known as Into the Mist, will also feature the next story scenario for the game post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Dawntrail</a>, as well as a new dungeon, trial, and even more endgame challenges for players to tackle.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, there are a couple of caveats to consider. For starters, Arc Raiders broke the Steam record when including PvP extraction shooters, but it's arguably not a requirement to fit in the genre. Without PvP, Helldivers 2 holds the top spot for the genre, according to<a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/1199779/" rel="nofollow "> SteamDB</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/">saw a huge resurgence in player counts</a> when the game came to Xbox Series X|S in August. Meanwhile, Escape From Duckov has peaked on Steam with a little over 300,000 concurrent players and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/">outgunned Battlefield 6 briefly</a> last week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Escape From Tarkov looms large in this discussion. The game that arguably put extraction shooters on the map <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/">will finally come to Steam on November 15</a> as part of the version 1.0 release. People who already own Escape From Tarkov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/">will have to pay again to play on Steam</a>, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders is also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S--in addition to PC. So keep in mind the concurrent-player numbers are obviously larger than just what's seen on Steam. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-cross-play-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6535834/">does have cross-play and cross-save</a>, too.

                <p>Before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was released last October, there was a report that the game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-for-at-least-a-year/1100-6526604/" data-ref-id="1100-6526604">a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5</a> for at least a year. Now, the year is up and an updated listing by the Entertainment Software Rating Board appears to indicate that a leap to Xbox Series X|S is immanent.</p><p>The ESRB has slightly modified <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Silent Hill 2 page</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>) to state that it's certified for the "Xbox Series" consoles. The rating itself hasn't changed, and it's still M for Mature. However, Microsoft and Konami have yet to formally announce the port or set a date for it. We can't even say for certain if Silent Hill 2 will get a physical release on Xbox, or if it will be digital only.</p><p>For now, there are no signs on the ESRB page that Silent Hill 2 will be coming to Switch 2 any time soon. But it's not out of the realm of possibility for the future.</p><p>Following Bloober Team's success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami announced that the studio is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. That project doesn't currently have a release window.</p><p>The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, was released last month to largely positive reviews. Konami announced that title alongside Silent Hill 2's remake, and Silent Hill: Townfall during the same livestream in 2022. Series producer Motoi Okamoto has said that the team revealed all three projects at once because, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-producer-explains-why-konami-announced-three-games-at-once/1100-6535588/" data-ref-id="1100-6535588">We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series</a>."</p><p>Outside of the games, a new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, will be released on January 23, 2026. The movie will be an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, and sees the return of the original film's director, Christoph Gans.</p>
