                <p>Riot Games has big plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/league-of-legends-review/1900-6415183/" data-ref-id="1900-6415183">League of Legends</a> in 2025, and they aren't limited to the original game. Project K, the new League of Legends-inspired trading card game, is on its way to a global rollout next year. And in the announcement video below, Project K looks like it's going after Magic the Gathering fans with some very familiar game mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1j7zvA3Sy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y1j7zvA3Sy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As laid out above by game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai, Project K supports 1v1 matches, but it can also include up to four players in 2v2 battles or free-for-all encounters. Riot Games also has grand ambitions of expanding the reach of Project K by partnering with stores for local events in addition to larger national and international tournaments featuring the best players in the world.</p><p>However, Riot Games doesn't appear to have a publishing and promotional partner in the US TGC scene yet. That's why Project K's initial launch will take place in the Chinese market in early 2025. According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/490418/league-legends-card-game-tcg-riot-games-project-k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Riot wants Project K's American launch to be as close as possible to the Chinese debut. But for now, there's no firm date for Project K's release in the United States.</p><p>Earlier this week, Riot addressed some of the fan backlash it received over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-push-back-against-league-of-legends-characters-arcane-makeover/1100-6528263/" data-ref-id="1100-6528263">Viktor's Arcane-inspired makeover</a> in League of Legends. The company has also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">League of Legends is introducing a seasonal model</a> starting in January 2025. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a> wrapped up its two-season run on Netflix last month, Riot has indicated that more adaptations are on the way. They just won't involve Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo, because the duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-got-paid-5-million-to-not-make-a-league-of-legends-movie-report/1100-6527614/" data-ref-id="1100-6527614">was paid $5 million</a> after their plans to make a live-action League of Legends movie fell apart over creative differences.</p>

                <p>Experiencing escape rooms is the closest thing many fans will have to being in a real video-game world. Three years ago, Pine Studio's Escape Simulator brought that experience home. Now, Pine Studio is doing it again with Escape Simulator 2. The accompanying announcement trailer includes a glimpse at three of the upcoming escape rooms, none of which are confined to a single environment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsl4DvPyJs4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gsl4DvPyJs4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Escape Simulator 2 will allow 1-8 players to step into intricately designed escape rooms that were created with help from real-life escape-room builders. The three rooms seen in the trailer are set in a pirate ship linked to a cursed treasure, an enigmatically empty starship stranded in space, and Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania. Before players can get out, they will be tasked to solve smaller mysteries in each room that add to the lore behind the experience.</p><p>Pine Studio co-founder Boris Barbir released a statement that touted the sequel's technical upgrades, including improved physics and animations. And despite the ominous tone of the trailer, Barbir insisted that "it's not a horror game--there are no jump scares or gore." He also pledged that Pine Studio will continue to support the original Escape Simulator while offering expansions for Escape Simulator 2 post-launch.</p><p>Escape Simulator 2 is now available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>, but a release date was not included in the announcement. The original Escape Simulator <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently on Steam</a> at a big discount, and it has a new Mayan DLC expansion that offers four additional escape room adventures to explore in the jungle.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">EA has made two of its patents accessible to the public, declaring them open-source, allowing non-EA developers to access technology the AAA publisher previously owned. Even better, this decision also means players who experience photosensitive seizures or need help with speech when gaming now have unfettered access to these patents as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Accessibility features in gaming have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/access-ability-announces-june-2024-summer-showcase/1100-6523281/">gained steam in recent years</a> as developers and software engineers work to ensure players with disabilities can access their games. In 2021, EA pledged to loosen restrictions on its patents, especially patents regarding hardware or software that's meant to improve a player's quality of life. Now, <a href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 2021 pledge has been updated</a> to announce the two patents that have been made available for free.</p><p dir="ltr">EA says that the ultimate goal of its speech-based patent is to "make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language, and speaking style." The second patent is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin called IRIS. IRIS automatically alerts developers to moments in their games that may trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.</p><p dir="ltr">"The sooner you start testing, the sooner you find potential issues," IRIS engineer Blanca Macazaga Zuaz said of the patented tech.</p><p>EA is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/">far from the only corporation</a> to lean in to accessibility features, but its decision to provide the public free access to the aforementioned patents is certainly an encouraging sign.</p>
