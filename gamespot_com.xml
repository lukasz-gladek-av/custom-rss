                <p>In 2015, developers Pilgrim Adventures and GrabTheGames Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-deed/" data-ref-id="5000-450997">The Deed</a>, an adventure-RPG that upended the traditional structure of mystery stories. This week, The Deed is available on Steam for free for a limited time, but only if you grab it quickly.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2P0BdvGoUo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2P0BdvGoUo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From now until Saturday, September 27 at 10 am, The Deed is free to all users on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/The_Deed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The best way to describe the premise is to invoke the board game Clue. Except this time, you're not out to find the killer because your character is the murderer, and the goal of the game is to get away with the crime. </p><p>Players assume control of Arran Bruce, a man who believes that he's the rightful heir to his family's ancestral home, Dunshiel House. Arran's father disagrees, and has cut him out of the will in favor of Arran's younger sister. For Arran, the solution is simple: His sister needs to die. How she dies is up to you as the player. </p><p>There are ten possible murder weapons, including a rope, a candlestick, and rat poison. Your weapon of choice also informs your decision about who to frame for the crime. Household servants and other members of Arran's family could be the prime suspects, if you play cards right and convincingly leave enough evidence. </p><p>Once Arran's sister is dead and a fall guy or girl is selected, there's one last task. The police send an inspector to investigate the crime and interrogate Arran. If players can't keep their stories together, they might be Columbo-ed and wind up in prison. There are multiple endings and not all of them positive for Arran. </p><p>While The Deed is only available for free this week, GameSpot has assembled our picks for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">the best free Steam games</a>, which you can grab right now.</p>

                <p>Last Year, Pacific Drive took players to an alternate version of the Pacific Northwest filled with bizarre horrors. The indie survival game was one of our favorite releases of the year, and soon it's getting a big new expansion, Whisper in the Woods, later in 2025. Even better, you'll be able to add a new physical edition of the game to your collection when the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRRN2T1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pacific Drive: Ritual Edition</a> launches for PS5 later this year.

This set is called Deluxe Pack ex, and it guarantees at least one rare card in every pack. However, unlike previous expansions, it will only be available for a limited time.</p><p>According to the official <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon website</a>, every Deluxe Pack ex pack will include "one card with a rarity of ♦♦♦♦ or higher from previous expansions, from Genetic Apex to Wisdom of Sea and Sky." Moreover, the expansion will introduce "parallel foil" cards that boast a special shine effect, as well as older cards with new artwork.

                <p>With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.</p><p>There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.</p><h2 id="When_does_Fortnitemares_2025_start_">When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?</h2><p>We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879"></a><figcaption>What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_collaborations_are_we_expecting_for_Fortnitemares_2025_">What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?</h2><p>It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The buzz is</a> that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1964043989398491543" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year</a>--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1965123026233819314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> R.E.P.O.</a>, though we don't know what exactly that will involve.</p><p>Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.</p><h2 id="Will_there_be_any_original_Fortnitemares_skins_">Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?</h2><p>It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year,<a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's looking like we're getting</a> a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065"></a><figcaption>Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Fortnitemares_2025_gameplay_changes">Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changes</h2><p>The start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.</p><p>So far, only two changes have leaked so far. It's rumored that there will be a <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953356487075545093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Voorhees medallion</a>, which has an unknown function, and also that there will be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1966950593307545947" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mythic version of Ghostface's trademark knife</a>.</p><p>As more is discovered about Fortnitemares 2025, we'll update this space, so look for frequent updates here as Epic's spooky season creeps ever closer.</p>
