                <p>With the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s newest episode, Heresy, comes a brand-new way to earn loot. This time, players will be headed back to the Dreadnaught orbiting Saturn to hunt for secrets and special rewards in the Nether. Here's how it works and how players can earn rewards, including secret loot stashes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Limited revives, ammo and health regen</h2><p dir="ltr">Nether delves are different from other activities in that player groups will have limited revives and health regeneration is disabled, meaning that players do not have passive healing after being out of combat for several seconds. Instead, enemies will drop white orbs that give back health, and all other healing effects, such as Support Frame auto rifles, Warlock Healing Rifts, and the Void Devour buff can still take effect. Special and Heavy ammo drops are also significantly reduced in this activity and can only be affected by weapon perks, armor mods, and shooting destructible pots to find more ammo.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to complete objectives in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535"></a><figcaption>A Tormentor boss in Destiny 2 channels some unknown power.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When players first spawn into the Nether activity, they will notice objectives like "Destroy Weapon Systems" on the HUD. It's not immediately obvious what these are, but upon pulling out the Ghost, the HUD will show a diamond on-screen where the next objective is. Usually, these objectives will be guarded by a yellow-bar enemy with a name and a quick objective to complete around it.</p><p dir="ltr">Objectives can range from collecting pickups to defeating a miniboss, depending on which objectives were drawn for the run. They can be any of the following, or a combination of these:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Defend an objective by standing on plates or marked areas and defeating waves of incoming enemies that culminate in a miniboss.</li><li dir="ltr">Depositing relics that come from floating objects scattered around the room into a receptacle like a statue. These are marked on the HUD.</li><li dir="ltr">Popping large orange spores that glow. Typically, these are on walls and corners and they glow bright orange and pulsate. Players can deal damage to these with any weapon.</li><li dir="ltr">Defeating a large Tormentor boss protected by a small objective like destroying Taken Blights or picking up Resonance nodes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Simply perform the objective and then collect Boons and loot at the end of each minor objective. When all three sub-objectives are complete, the boss will be vulnerable. The boss will usually consist of invincibility phases where players need to collect or destroy an object in the arena to make the boss vulnerable again. The Nether run will end upon defeating the boss, and loot will come from the last chest at the end.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find secret loot in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536"></a><figcaption>A node of Fleeting Metastasized Essentia in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are tons of small secrets scattered around the Nether, including hidden loot and special collectibles. There are chests hidden around the entire location in corners and secret rooms that can reward materials for the Tome of Want, a seasonal armor piece, or a seasonal weapon. Here is everything that can be earned in a chest in Act 1:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Any piece of Apostate’s Blade armor; Arms, chest, legs, or class item.</li><li dir="ltr">Adamantite, a Strand Support Frame auto rifle.</li><li dir="ltr">Psychopomp, an Area Denial Frame grenade launcher.</li><li dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge, a Wave Frame heavy sword.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are also Metastasized Essentia nodes, large black and white spiked orbs that can be picked up for materials for the Shaping Mirror in Eris' apartment in the H.E.L.M. When picked up, they are first seen as Fleeting Metastasized Essentia.</p><p dir="ltr">These can be lost upon wiping in the Nether by running out of Revives or if players disconnect during a run. Only at the end of a Nether run will these turn into Metastasized Essentia that can be kept and used. Take a stack of 10 Essentia to the Taken Altar to Eris Morn’s apartment, which looks like a small stone pillar with a black orb in it next to a shelf, and you will be rewarded with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">At least two reprised weapons</li><li dir="ltr">A stack of 10 Essence of Desire</li><li dir="ltr">Enhancement Cores and or Enhancement Prisms</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If players want to check out how to get more rewards during Episode Heresy, check out how they should use the Shaping Slab and the Tome of Want for gear curating and extra buffs in the Nether.
