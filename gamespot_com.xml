                <p>Through most of last year, IO Interactive assured players that its upcoming James Bond title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, was set for an early 2026 debut. The game had been scheduled to debut on March 27, but the release date has now been pushed back to May 27.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement posted online</a> late last month, IO Interactive's Hakan Abrak called 007 First Light the company's "most ambitious project to date" while mentioning the Bond staples included in the game like car chases, gadgets, and wild globe-trotting adventure. However, he went on to say that the decision to delay it "allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."</p><p>"The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end," added Abrak. "So these two additional months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first announced the game."</p><p>In November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-dev-reacts-to-gta-6-delay-and-explains-why-the-game-is-good-for-the-industry/1100-6536420/" data-ref-id="1100-6536420">Abrak spoke about GTA 6's delay</a> and why he thinks it was a good thing for 007 First Light and the industry in general. The new game features Patrick Gibson as a much younger James Bond than the character is usually portrayed, and the story will introduce a new origin for 007.</p><p>007 First Light narrative director Martin Emborg recently told GameSpot that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-knows-the-key-ingredient-to-a-great-james-bond-adventure/1100-6537117/" data-ref-id="1100-6537117">Lenny Kravitz's pirate king Bawma</a> won't be the only villain featured in the game. He also highlighted Kravitz's role in the creation of the character.</p><p>"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," said Emborg. "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p>007 First Light will be available on Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
