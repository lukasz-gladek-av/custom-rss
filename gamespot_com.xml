In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about the Switch 2--or whatever the next console is called--and what's been speculated about the next system from Nintendo. There has been quite a lot of news about the next Nintendo console lately. In fact, it appears the rumor mill is really heating up of late, though this doesn't necessarily mean an official announcement is coming up soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has made multiple announcements lately, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-alarmo-alarm-clock-only-works-with-switch-2-in-our-dreams/1100-6527034/" data-ref-id="1100-6527034">alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">a music app</a>, but there hasn't been any <em>official</em> word on the Switch 2. </p><p dir="ltr">2025 kicked off with a juicy rumor, as people claim to have their hands on the Switch 2's Joy-Cons. Images posted online claiming to be the new controllers suggest they will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">sport a similar design to the original, though they could be hiding a new feature or two.</a> Another recent report detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">how many units the Switch 2 could sell in the US during its first year.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Another recent report that claimed the next Nintendo console is indeed called, simply, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">Switch 2. </a>One Chinese retailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-switch-2-accessories-are-now-available-to-buy-with-a-major-asterisk/1100-6528194/" data-ref-id="1100-6528194">selling screen protectors and carrying cases for the Switch 2</a>, and these could contain clues about the form factor and size of the Switch 2. They also might be totally fake or speculative.</p><p dir="ltr">This post covers the system's potential form factor, rumors about the the Switch 2 release date, price, launch games, backward compatibility, and more. For simplicity's sake, we'll refer to the new system as the Switch 2, although it seems likely that, based on Nintendo's history, it will have some kind of new, original name for the console. Time will tell.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of unanswered questions remaining about the Switch 2, but for now, here's all the essential information we have.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_leaked_images">Switch 2 leaked images</h2><p>A major development for the Switch 2 came in mid-September 2024 when unverified images of what's claimed to be the Nintendo Switch successor<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/" data-ref-id="1100-6526551"> appeared online</a>, revealing a console that isn't a radical departure from the current Switch console design. The images suggest that the Switch will sport a bigger eight-inch screen, Joy-Cons that use a magnetic attachment, and significantly improved hardware in comparison to the current model.</p><p>The pictures were first found on a Chinese social media site and uploaded to Reddit. While Nintendo has not commented on them, a source told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that the <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1836369796742398294" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit images line up</a> with what partners have been told to expect with the final Switch 2 design.</p><p>In November and early December 2024, the alleged Switch 2 leaked images continued to pour out, this time revealing a closer look at the reportedly updated and more ergonomically designed Joy-Cons. The images seem to show a number of updates over the existing Joy-Cons, including bigger SL/SR buttons, a pedal back button, and a more curved design, among other things.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">BREAKING: Nintendo Switch 2 Joycons Allegedly Leaked ⚠️‼️<br>✅️ Larger SL/SR Buttons<br>✅️ New Pedal Back Button<br>✅️ Curved Design<br>✅️ Resembles September 2024 Leak<br>✅️ Pics from China Factory<br>✅️ Leaked on Bilibili <a href="https://t.co/jv3LDBRu0r" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jv3LDBRu0r</a></p>  — Deck Wizard (@deckwizardyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Then in January 2025, new images of the supposed Joy-Cons emerged, and, crucially, it appears the new controllers could feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">mouse functionality.</a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new Joy-con appear to have an optical sensor similar to a mouse on the side, so people are speculating now they could be used as a mouse <a href="https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd</a></p>  — Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Switch_2_Rumored_Release_Date">Switch 2 Rumored Release Date</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know for sure. The Switch launched in March 2017 and console generations are known to be in the area of 5-10 years, but there is no guarantee that Nintendo would follow a similar playbook with its next piece of hardware. Trends are always changing due to a variety of factors.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wii and Wii U, for example, launched in November of 2006 and 2012, but it's anyone's guess as to the launch month for the next Nintendo console.</p><p dir="ltr">A September 2024 release date for the Switch 2 emerged in an official press release from the newest interaction of GameShark. But it proved to not be legitimate. After that, an analyst suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-report/1100-6520627/" data-ref-id="1100-6520627">Switch 2 will launch in 2024 and feature and an 8-inch LCD screen</a>--but that, of course, didn't happen either. </p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, someone at the Consumer Electronics Show spoke with peripheral company Genki and was apparently informed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Switch 2 will launch in April 2025.</a> This is not confirmed, of course. </p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced during the company's current fiscal year (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025)</a>, so the official reveal could happen anytime now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">During an earnings call</a>, Furukawa alluded to what the Switch 2 might be in terms of an evolution over the first system. Several times in the briefing, Furukawa spoke about the "successor to the Nintendo Switch," suggesting that the new device will build on the foundation established by the Switch console.</p><p>"At this stage, we cannot say anything more about the successor to Nintendo Switch," Furukawa said when asked why that term was used specifically. "For today's announcement, we determined that the most appropriate expression to use was 'successor to Nintendo Switch.' Information will be released in stages leading up to the launch, as we have done with previous new hardware announcements."</p><p>Recently, GI.biz reporter Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1823411988342374567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "No developer I've spoken to expects it to launch in this financial year, in fact they've been told not to expect it in this financial year. A bunch of people I spoke to hope it's out in April/May time."</p><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer said it corroborated this</a>, noting that the next Switch console won't be released until April 2025 at the very soonest.</p><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that his company "obviously" plans to develop games for the Switch 2 and that he "can't wait for it to be out." However, he's also OK with Nintendo taking their time to get it right.</p><p>"I mean, honestly, I'd rather have them wait a year and get it perfect than rush it to the market and then we all complain about what doesn't work. Switch has been such a fantastic product, I can wait another year if I have to," he said. "And from development, I think most non-Nintendo developers are not exclusively doing titles for the Switch. They're always part of a portfolio mix of platform mix. Just wait."</p><p>Recently, analyst David Gibson suggested the Switch 2 may release in March 2025. Gibson pointed out that one of Nintendo's assembling partners, Hosiden, is spending lots of money in preparation for... something. As such, Gibson suggested this might be related to the Switch 2.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1831321550185959553" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No-one seems to have noticed the Nintendo assembler- Hosiden is spending ¥2bn on production equipment and ¥1bn on automation in FY3/25 for its major customer in amusement (Nintendo).

Former Nintendo employees have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> it will have a similar form factor to the Switch and that it can be used as a handheld device and also dock to your TV like the existing model does. Nintendo, for its part, has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how the aim is for it to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/">"surprise and delight"</a> fans, so we only have predictions and guesses to go on for now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-nintendo-switch-2-details-continue-to-emerge/1100-6518945/">Digital Foundry reported</a> that the Switch 2 may use Nvidia's new custom variant T239 processor. The site compiled a PC based on what it believed the Switch 2's specs could be and found that it could capably run Death Stranding at 1080p at an average of 35 fps.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo consoles are historically less powerful than the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and many believe that might be the case for the next system as well. But no one knows for sure. Whether or not the Switch 2 could be a 4K-capable device or offer cutting-edge graphics and performance is unknown.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vandal </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-reportedly-has-magnetic-joy-cons-might-not-support-existing-ones/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) recently reported that the Switch 2 will use Joy-Con controllers once again, but this time, they will attach to the system magnetically. Whether or not the existing Joy-Cons you might own already will work on the system is unknown. The report also mentioned how the current Switch Pro controller will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tah4ALPgOk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Silicon podcast </a>recently (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode-battery-life-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), Moore's Law Is Dead and The Phawx had a conversation in which it was suggested by Moore's Law is Dead that the Switch 2 will be "clocked faster than we expect" in its docked mode. In undocked mode, it's "going to be clocked crazy low," apparently. The goal, apparently, is to help the Switch 2 have a longer battery life when played on the go compared to the original Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023" data-ratio="0.54519774011299" data-width="2124" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023"></a><figcaption>The next Nintendo console could launch in 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png"></figure><p>While Switch sales boomed during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage presented new challenges for Nintendo as it struggled to meet demand. For the Switch 2, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">doesn't "anticipate" this to be a problem ahead of the launch of the Switch 2</a>. At the same time, Nintendo's sales forecast for the financial year doesn't currently factor in Switch 2 sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-window-still-uncertain-despite-nintendos-earnings-news-analyst-says/1100-6523313/" data-ref-id="1100-6523313">but that could change in time</a>.</p><h2 id="Gen_AI_">Gen AI?</h2><p>Artificial intelligence, or more specifically, generative artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games--and technology in general. But will Nintendo implement genAI for the Switch 2 and its games? It remains to be seen, but Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently weighed in to say Nintendo will carefully consider the use of genAI.</p><p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A with investors</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>, Furukawa is reported to have said AI has been used in video game development for ages already for things like controlling enemy characters. But genAI is a different story.</p><p>"Generative AI, which has been a hot topic in recent years, can be more creative, but we also recognize that it has issues with intellectual property rights," he said. "We have decades of know-how in creating optimal gaming experiences for our customers, and while we remain flexible in responding to technological developments, we hope to continue to deliver value that is unique to us and cannot be achieved through technology alone."</p><h2 id="Switch_2_Games_and_Backward_Compatibility">Switch 2 Games and Backward Compatibility</h2><p>It's widely expected that Nintendo will release a new Mario Kart game for its next home console–there are not many safer bets in gaming that one could make. A report said Mario Kart 9 will have some kind of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/">"new twist,"</a> and fans are eagerly waiting to see what that might be. If a new Mario Kart game is in the works, it would seemingly make business sense for it to be a launch title for the next console. A report from 2023 said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-already-with-developers-launching-in-2024-report/1100-6516402/">a number of developers already had the new Nintendo console at their offices</a> and were beginning to build games for it, but none have been announced or even hinted at thus far.</p><p dir="ltr">A major question fans want to know is whether or not the next Nintendo console will support games from the Switch, and on November 6, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2</a>. Not only that, but Nintendo Switch Online will work across Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," Nintendo confirmed. "Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back with GameSpot for more as we learn more about the next Nintendo console, as we'll continue to update this story as more information comes to light.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_Price">Switch 2 Price</h2><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 has not been announced, so everything is guesswork at this stage. But one analyst recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> that the Switch 2 will cost $400 and that its top-tier games will sell for $70. The original Switch launched at $300, and its relatively low price point no doubt helped the system perform exceptionally well in the market. Whether or not the next Nintendo console launches with just one SKU or multiple editions, at various price points, remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the prediction about game costs rising to $70, that wouldn't be very surprising. After all, Nintendo already charged $70 for Tears of the Kingdom, and it was a sales juggernaut at that price point. Nintendo said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-be-worth-its-70-price-tag-nintendo-president-says/1100-6512284/">that was a one-off for Switch game prices</a>, but charging $70 for Switch 2 games would bring Nintendo in line with what companies like Microsoft and Sony, as well as a variety of third-party publishers, charge for their leading titles.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_News">Switch 2 News</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's previous consoles had their own account systems and players had to create new accounts for subsequent hardware launches. But the new overarching Nintendo Account changes this, and this could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">ease the transition to the next Nintendo console. </a></p><p dir="ltr">It "allows us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition," Nintendo's Doug Bowser said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to minimize the dip you typically see in the last year of one cycle and the beginning of another," he added. "I can't speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's CEO, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in 2023 that the next Nintendo console will use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">the same Nintendo Account system as the Switch</a>, so hearing Bowser suggest something similar is no big surprise.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/nintendo-s-record-gain-tested-in-wait-for-switch-2-tech-watch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Yijia Zhai of Macquarie Group Ltd. said the next Nintendo console is not going to be able to match the success of the Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not think the new console will be as successful as the Switch, and see potential profit-taking after the announcement," Zhai said, further noting that Macquarie had downgraded Nintendo's stock analysis to "neutral."</p><p dir="ltr">Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata, meanwhile, said the next Nintendo hardware likely won't increase the total addressable market for Nintendo. However, the firm isn't married to that idea and says its forecast could change if the system "turns out to be new concept hardware rather than a successor along the same lines as the Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">A console not being as successful as the last one might not tell the whole story and isn't necessarily totally bad news for Nintendo. The Switch, of course, performed exceptionally well in terms of hardware and software sales. And that success is all the more apparent following the dismal performance of the Wii U.</p><p>In September 2024, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said the next Nintendo console may "disrupt" the video game industry.</p><p>"A couple of things will really impact how things go: Nintendo's next hardware device, expected to arrive next year, could significantly disrupt the market," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "Of course, not much is known about this device beyond rumor, but a highly successful new Nintendo device could apply downward pricing pressure across other devices. But we'll have to wait and see."</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo calls its next console, is expected to be announced soon and released later this year. But how many units will the system sell? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US during 2025.</p><p>This assumes that the Switch 2 launches in the first half of 2025, Piscatella clarified. He added that the Switch should make up about one third of all video game consoles sold during 2025 in the US, excluding PC portable devices.</p><p>Piscatella went on to say that he expects the Switch 2 to face "hardware constraints" for several months after launch, and that the total number of units sold will depend on how many Nintendo can produce. Despite the popularity of a new Nintendo console, Piscatella said he continues to expect Sony's PlayStation 5 to be the No. 1 best-selling console in the US in 2025 based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo's platforms are popular globally, and US sales represent just one piece of the console's expected overall sales. Circana tracks the US video game industry specifically. </p><p>The Switch 2 has big shoes to fill, as the existing which has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 145 million systems and more than 1.3 billion games to date.</a></p><p>Nintendo has said it will officially announce the new console by the end of March 2025, and while we wait for that, the rumor floodgates have opened. Plenty of unverified images and details about the system, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">purported new Joy-Cons</a>, have emerged in recent days and weeks. Another recent rumor said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Switch 2 will launch this April.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 could be one of gaming's biggest stories in 2025, alongside the expected launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in Fall 2025.</p>
