                <p>Blue Prince from Dogubomb and Raw Fury has emerged as the highest-rated game of 2025 thus far on GameSpot sister site Metacritic.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a>, players explore a manor with shifting rooms. In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj5usM4tGM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had," GameSpot's Steve Watts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-prince-review-an-intricate-layered-roguelike-puzzle/1900-6418355/" data-ref-id="1900-6418355">wrote in a glowing review</a>. "It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric. Like each of my dozens of permutations of the Mount Holly manor house itself, it is truly one of a kind."</p><p>Blue Prince currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92 on Metacritic</a>, making its aggregate score the highest of 2025. It dethroned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, which currently has an aggregate score of 91. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-roottrees-are-dead-2023/" data-ref-id="5000-664554">The Roottrees are Dead</a> round out Metacritic's top five <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-reviewed games of the year</a> so far. That's some impressive company Blue Prince finds itself in, and suggests it will be this year's indie darling, just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was last year.</p><p>Blue Prince isn't out yet, and if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you won't even have to pay for it when it launches. It will be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10, and it will be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has said that Switch 2's eShop won't have any theme music, just like the first Switch didn't, as a result of not wanting to disrupt the user experience.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said, "Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games." Before the Switch, systems like Wii and Wii U had music themes playing as users browsed their respective eShops. "We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there."</p><p>Kawamoto added that he wanted to make sure that browsing the Switch 2 eShop was a smooth experience, that the list doesn't stall, and that pages load fast. Due to those factors, the eShop won't have any theme music.</p><p>He also admitted that he booted up the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any other application on the Wii system. The Wii Shopping channel is known for its catchy theme, and it's so popular that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-labo-players-cover-wii-shop-music-and-bil/1100-6458475/" data-ref-id="1100-6458475">players created covers of it in Nintendo Labo</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, some Nintendo Labo kits are one of the few games that aren't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatible</a> on Switch 2. More specifically, it's the Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This kit requires players to insert the Switch tablet into the Toy-Con device. Since the Switch 2 tablet is larger than the original Switch, it won't fit.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Direct</a> last week, tons of new info dropped. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">defended Mario Kart World's staggering $80 price tag</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649">Switch 2 carts still taste bad</a>, just like the carts of the first Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launches on June 5.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence remains one of the biggest talking points in video games and many other industries, and now Nintendo of America's president has weighed in to share his thoughts.</p><p>Doug Bowser told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/nintendo-president-on-the-new-switch-2-tariffs-and-whats-next.html?jwsource=cl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> that he sees opportunities for AI technologies to enhance productivity in some areas, but when it comes to actual game development, humans will always lead the way.</p><p>"If developers choose to use AI--and it is a discussion right now at Nintendo--it's not the only method of developing games," he said. "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers. Their artistic capabilities. Their insight into how people play. So there is always, always going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>He added that AI is no different than any other new technology that's come onto the market, saying Nintendo might choose to leverage it if it helps to create "a better gameplay experience."</p><p>It appears Nintendo's executives are aligned in their messaging on this subject, as Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Looking outside Nintendo, Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a>.</p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> launches in June. The price point was announced at $450, but some believe Nintendo will end up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">raising prices due to newly announced tariffs. </a></p>
