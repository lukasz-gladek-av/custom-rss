                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> may be out now, but the PS5 itself remains a popular gift this holiday season. A PS5 was even seemingly given to one young fan attending a Hornets game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina earlier this week. The NBA team brought the kid out to the court and pretended to give him a PS5 for Christmas before quickly taking it back after the cameras cut away.</p><p>The giveaway was captured on social media by Adam Turner, who shared the video below. Turner also said the Hornets only gave the kid a jersey after taking back the PS5.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You guys want to see a cheap sports organization?<br>In this video my best friend&amp;his nephew get called onto court for a special segment where they gift the kid a PS5 publicly… w/cameras off they TOOK IT AWAY and gave him a jersey.<br>😂 Take a bow <a href="https://twitter.com/hornets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hornets</a>… crushed the kid <a href="https://t.co/mcj5hhsuM5" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/mcj5hhsuM5</a></p>  — USMNT_STAN (@StanUsmnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This caused such an uproar that the Hornets subsequently issued an apology that claimed the giveaway was meant to be an on-court skit. The Hornets went on to say that the team has reached out to the family of the boy to offer him a PS5 and a VIP experience at a future home game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/hornets-apologize-after-pretending-to-give-child-ps5-and-taking-it-away-off-camera-230954440.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yahoo Sports</a>, the boy's uncle was informed ahead of time that he wouldn't be keeping the PS5, but apparently no one told the child. The story quickly picked up steam nationally and in the local press before the Hornets reversed course. Turner <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1869243676637217209" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequently wrote</a>, "Credit to Hornets for making it right [and] taking immediate action. Owning mistakes is a great thing and often organizations try to cover their tracks."</p><p>Until last year, NBA legend Michael Jordan was the controlling owner of the Hornets before selling the majority of his stake to a new ownership team.</p>

                <p>Developer Hardlight and publisher Sega dropped an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sega/p/DDujE-5Je2M/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update today</a>, December 18, for the Apple Arcade exclusive Sonic Dream Team, which adds Shadow the Hedgehog as a new playable character.</p><p>Shadow has his own abilities revolving around his Chaos powers, rather than simply being a reskinned version of Sonic. He can use his Chaos Control and Chaos Shift abilities, which lock enemies and environments in place. These powers can be unlocked by completing Shadow's challenges.</p><p>Players can enter Tails' Challenges to unlock Shadow to use in Adventure mode. There are also six new Shadow-themed statues to collect, a reworked tutorial, and new music tracks.</p><p>Sega celebrated Sonic's favorite anti-hero quite a lot this year. In October, Sega released Sonic X Shadow Generations, a remaster of the 2011 Sonic Generations game with some newly added Shadow content. Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-delivers-rapid-fire-antics-with-his-toughest-fight-yet/1100-6526119/" data-ref-id="1100-6526119">Keanu Reeves as Shadow</a>, will be available to watch in theaters on December 20.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic X Shadow Generations review</a>, we said, "Sonic X Shadows Generations is a celebration of a specific era of Sonic games, for better and worse."</p>

                <p>The holidays are here, which means imminent panic trying to score the perfect gift and Mariah Carey dominating the airwaves. Now, Carey is possibly adding another notch to her pop-culture-icon crown by taking her Santa catsuit to Fortnite.</p><p>Frequent Fortnite leaker Shiina has revealed that Mariah Carey will be heading to the game as a skin as part of the upcoming Winterfest event, donning her "All I Want For Christmas Is You" apparel. Along for the sleigh ride will be Snoop Dogg and Shaq--the latter whom was just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shaq-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526822/" data-ref-id="1100-6526822">added a few months back</a>--also wearing festive looking to get players in the Christmas spirit.</p><p>Additional leaks have suggested that with the outfit, Mariah will also have emotes and bonus animations such as defrosting from an ice block, which stems from a joke the star eventually embraced and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporated into her own socials</a> during this time of the year.</p><p>The 2024 Winterfest is set to kick off on December 20, running through January 7. Players are expecting to unlock Mariah after the downtime for the v33.11 update ends. Epic Games has not given any official timeline on when you can access the Songtress, so players will have to keep their eyes peeled this week.</p>

While the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">touted Ricochet's successes</a>, the team behind the program is acknowledging that there have been some problems with it during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty's official site</a>, the Ricochet team said, "We did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 1--particularly for Ranked Play. We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek."</p><p>To that end, the team wrote that account bans are now happening hourly and investigations into cheaters have been ramped up to include more manual reviews of clips from matches in addition to the AI systems already in place to detect cheaters and hackers via the Replay tool. They also stated that cheaters will be removed from leaderboards faster thanks to greater synchronization with the investigations.</p><p>There have been issues with Ricochet where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-anti-cheat-was-falsely-banning-legitimate-players-but-all-accounts-have-been-restored/1100-6527252/" data-ref-id="1100-6527252">legitimate Call of Duty accounts were mistakenly banned</a>, most of which were restored.

                <p dir="ltr">Epic Games has announced it is taking legal action against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player for cheating during a tournament. The publisher recently filed a lawsuit against against Sebastian Araujo, due to multiple instances of alleged cheating that took place during tournament gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The complaint filed by Epic alleges that Araujo has used cheat software in multiple Fortnite tournaments, giving him an "unfair advantage over other, non-cheating players." Specifically, Araujo is accused of using both aimbotting software and cheats that allows him to see other players through walls. Worse, Epic claims that using these cheats in Fortnite tournaments allowed Araujo to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money.</p><p dir="ltr">"Araujo pocketed thousands of dollars that other competitors in the tournaments--who played by the rules--had no real chance to win," the complaint states.</p><p dir="ltr">“We want Fortnite tournaments to be fun and fair for all competitors. People who cheat in tournaments to gain an unfair advantage ruin the experience for everyone. We are making<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-details-chapter-6-season-1" rel="nofollow "> fundamental changes</a> to combat cheating in our tournaments, including taking legal action against players that break our rules,” said Brent Coyle, Competitive Director at Epic Games.</p><p>This isn't the first time Epic Games has taken action against Fortnite cheaters. In 2022, the publisher won a lawsuit against an Australian Fortnite cheater, and in a surprisingly wholesome twist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/">Epic donated the settlement money to charity</a>. If Epic wins this lawsuit, Araujo could end up like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/" data-ref-id="1100-6499405">PUBG cheat-maker who was forced to pay $10 million</a> after losing a lawsuit filed by Krafton Inc. and Tencent, or the Destiny 2 cheater who was ordered to pay $500,000 in damages on top of being hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cheater-legally-banned-from-ever-playing-another-bungie-game/1100-6517641/" data-ref-id="1100-6517641">the perma-ban to end all perma-bans</a>.</p>

It includes his faithful steed, Invincible, as well as mount trophies for the Lich King's helmet, the Helm of Domination, and his legendary runeblade, Frostmourne.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1824" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938"></a><figcaption>These are just some of the items owners of The War Within and Vessel of Hatred can claim for free.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To claim the bundle free of charge, players will simply need to own both Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion and WoW: The War Within before January 7. Blizzard states the bundle will be delivered to qualifying players by January 13. Both expansions are currently on sale via <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/sale/holiday-sale-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle.net</a> through January 6, with Vessel of Hatred 25% off and The War Within 30% off.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who primarily spend their time in Azeroth, there are some free rewards to be claimed there as well.

Those rewards include the Amalgam of Rage mount, Tome of Town Portal toy, the Baa'lial pet, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's just the latest free offering for Diablo 4 players. Blizzard recently gave away <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">free level 50 character boosts to all Diablo 4 players</a>, with Vessel of Hatred owners earning two free boosts. The boosts fully deck out players in a new set of gear and automatically unlock all of the game's stat-boosting Altars of Lilith. Blizzard said the reason behind the boost is to give returning players a fresh entry point following the game's massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn</a> and Vessel of Hatred updates earlier this year. The two updates dramatically overhauled Diablo 4's loot and endgame systems but in the process made many old items and builds from the game's launch obsolete.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. To celebrate, a number of Blizzard games, including Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Overwatch 2, offered WoW-themed cosmetics</a>.
