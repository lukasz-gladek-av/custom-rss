                <p>Monument Valley 3, the third entry in the indie puzzle game series, is out today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monument-valley-3-announced-exclusively-for-netflix-games-at-gamescom-with-prequel-ports/1100-6525992/" data-ref-id="1100-6525992">exclusively on Netflix Games</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-a-monument-valley-for-the-netflix-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, developer Ustwo spoke about its history with mobile platforms and how introducing live-service elements to Monument Valley 3 was a natural transition. Usetwo is planning to release new content for Monument Valley 3 with every real-life season, along with new activities and puzzles on a regular basis. Previous games in the series had DLC.</p><p>"But for Monument Valley, [we've] always done downloadable content. It's just less rhythmic, less predictable, when they come out," explained director Jennifer Estaris. "And so for me, it was about. How do we make that a healthy habit for players, where they can know that something is coming and they get excited about it? But also tied to the themes of the game about caring for the world, not just being a one-and-done experience."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ew6PCGzOk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E9ew6PCGzOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ustwo's other games have been on Netflix and Apple Arcade before, including Assemble with Care and Desta: The Memories Between, so the developer is comfortable working on mobile platforms. Monument Valley, after all, is a series that started on mobile devices before coming to PC.</p><p>"Personally, I don't think Monument Valley 3 would be a Monument Valley game if it had to mould itself to the requirements of a free-to-play model in order to survive," said lead producer Jonathan Lau. "So it could only have survived on a subscription service, regardless of who that was with."</p><p>So far, Monument Valley 3 is sitting at around a 70 average on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monument-valley-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a> with three reviews in. Both Monument Valley and its sequel are available on Netflix as well. Given that they also received PC versions later on, it's possible Monument Valley 3 might too, but as of now, it's exclusive to Netflix.</p>

                <p>Following its week post-launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has its first patch of fixes, which will help with many of the environmental and audio issues currently in the game. The free-to-play online shooter pits some of Marvel's biggest guns--pun intended--against each other to take down Dr. Doom and Doom 2099. Patch 1 handles a lot of on-the-surface issues, but affects a few heroes including Dr. Strange. You can check out the full list below.</p><p>The big issue that was addressed involved players getting stuck on certain maps after being hit close to the edge. However, as the bug happens across multiple maps and areas, it might still be an issue elsewhere now.</p><p>"However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue," the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent blog post</a> read. "So we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again."</p><p>The general minor bugs NetEase managed to resolve completely were issues like removing a lag when dealing with playing back highlights and recordings. There were also some textual errors, with more fixes on the way in a future update. Some common crash issues were also fixed, especially when dealing with saving Highlights. After the game crashes, the game had a chance to freeze for a long time before closing, but now the game will close after crashing.</p><p>Other small fixes include properly showing heroes' equipped costumes after joining a Quick Match as a replacement, and displaying mission progress correctly on the Season Event screen.</p><p>There were also minor console and PC issues that were resolved. On PC, when using FSR 3 frame-generation technology to modify the resolution, it could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. For PlayStation, when players have the Scarlet Spider costume equipped, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. Both issues have been resolved.</p><h3>Maps and Game Modes:</h3><ul><li>On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. That particular issue was mostly fixed, but as it happens in multiple stages, it could still happen somewhere else now.</li><li>In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Birnin T'Challa: The fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield, during Competitive play, if a player was KOâ€™d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lighting to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument, when the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.</li></ul><h3>Heroes</h3><ul><li>When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.</li></ul>
