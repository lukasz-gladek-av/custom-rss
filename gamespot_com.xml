                <p>As part of the Call of Duty: Next event today, Activision made a series of major announcements about the FPS franchise, including what's next for Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>To begin with, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s integration into Warzone will begin in Season 1, and this will include a brand-new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow. This is a smaller map than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982" data-ratio="0.55223880597015" data-width="2144" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982"></a><figcaption>Haven's Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The map takes place in Liberty Falls, which is the town from Black Ops 6 Zombies prior to the zombie outbreak. Given that timeline, the map doesn't include a zombies aesthetic and instead has a more vibrant color tone, along with many points of interest to explore. The map was designed and developed by High Moon Studios.</p><p>The other big Warzone news from Call of Duty: Next is that Warzone's very first map, Verdansk, is remaining the main map for Warzone going forward. It's not exactly the same map as you remember it, though, as two new POIs have been added: Factory and Signal Station.</p><p>Verdansk was the OG map for Warzone when the game launched in 2020. It remained playable until 2021 when it was removed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-discusses-verdansks-return-and-feedback-so-far/1100-6530838/" data-ref-id="1100-6530838">only to come back earlier this year.</a> Its return prompted a resurgence in Warzone players, so it's no surprise to see Activision stick with it.</p><p>There are gameplay updates in Warzone coming as well, including a limit of five attachments and no Wildcards. Additionally, tactical sprint has been removed and is now only available via the Sprinter perk. The combat roll ability from Black Ops 7 is also coming to Warzone through the Mountaineer perk. Finally, there is greater ground loot coming to Warzone. All of this was confirmed by Charlie Intel.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Warzone gameplay updates:</p><p>- Weapons: 5 attachments only, no Wildcards, Overkill by default <br>- Tactical Sprint removed, now in Sprinter Perk<br>- Combat Roll from BO7 added via Mountaineer Perk <br>- Greater ground loot, including curated weapon builds <a href="https://t.co/C1WWQKT8Z7" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/C1WWQKT8Z7</a></p></div>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973086382529691700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

                <p>EA is preparing to go private, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">as the veteran video game company will be sold</a> for an eye-watering sum of $55 billion to an investor consortium made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. While this deal will require regulator approval and a sign-off by stockholders, EA is expecting the deal to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p><p>A privately owned EA could be a very different company when compared to its public incarnation, and it will also have to work off $20 billion of new debt that is being used to finance the buyout. So what does $55 billion buy you these days? Quite a <em>lot</em>, as EA's potential new owners will be acquiring studios, brands, and much more. Here's a broad overview of all things EA</p><h2>EA's various entertainment studios</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817"></a><figcaption>EA has established a rich library of games over the years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg"></figure><p>EA has built up a sizable collection of studios under its portfolio, and several of these have become responsible for EA's biggest hits. Criterion Games has developed several Need for Speed titles, DICE is best known for its work on the Battlefield series, and Maxis made a name for itself with The Sims.</p><p>Then there's Motive Studio--a developer that has alternated between being a support studio and working on big projects like Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake--PopCap Games has developed several popular mobile titles, and Respawn Entertainment has been responsible for several of EA's best single-player games in the modern era.</p><p>BioWare has a storied history, but after mass layoffs at the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, it's not certain what state the famed studio is in. Work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-team-should-scapegoat-dragon-age-to-get-more-resources-former-bioware-dev-says/1100-6533885/" data-ref-id="1100-6533885">new Mass Effect game</a> has been going on for several years now, but the high-profile flop of Anthem and underwhelming sales for Dragon Age: The Veilguard have left people wondering what its future looks like under a privately owned EA.</p><p>The studios listed above are just the tip of the EA iceberg, as the company also has Skate developer Full Circle, EA Gothenburg, Codemasters, and even more subsidiaries.</p><h2>EA Entertainment</h2><ul><li>BioWare (Includes BioWare Austin)</li><li>Criterion Games (Includes Criterion Cheshire)</li><li>DICE (Includes Frostbite Labs)</li><li>EA Baton Rouge</li><li>EA Galway in Galway, Ireland.</li><li>EA Gothenburg</li><li>EA Korea Studio</li><li>EA Capital Games</li><li>EA Redwood Studios</li><li>Firemonkeys Studios</li><li>Glu Mobile</li><li>Playdemic</li><li>Slingshot Games</li><li>Tracktwenty Studios</li><li>Full Circle</li><li>Maxis (Includes Maxis Texas and Maxis Europe)</li><li>Motive Studio (Includes Motive Studio Vancouver)</li><li>Pogo Studios</li><li>PopCap Games (Includes PopCap Shanghai and PopCap Hyderabad)</li><li>Respawn Entertainment (Includes Respawn Vancouver and Respawn Wisconsin)</li><li>Ripple Effect Studios</li></ul><h2>EA Sports</h2><p>The other jewel in the EA crown is its EA Sports division.

Sure, a lot of these franchises like Army of Two and Titanfall haven't received new entries in years, but ownership of them is still potentially lucrative in an age of transmedia projects. Then there are the licensed IP that EA has worked on, with several Star Wars games under its belt--and more on the way--collaborations with smaller studios that have resulted in critically acclaimed games like Split Fiction being released under the EA Originals label, and various sports games that feature hundreds of official licensing deals to make them as authentic as possible.</p><ul><li>Battlefield</li><li>Need for Speed</li><li>Medal of Honor</li><li>Madden Football</li><li>EA Sports FC</li><li>The Sims</li><li>Mirror's Edge</li><li>Titanfall</li><li>Apex Legends</li><li>Mass Effect</li><li>Dragon Age</li><li>Dead Space</li><li>Plants vs Zombies</li><li>Command and Conquer</li><li>Skate</li><li>Army of Two</li><li>Bejeweled</li><li>Peggle</li></ul><h2>EA All Play</h2><p>EA's mobile-focused label, this part of the company is also involved in digital titles and digital board games.</p><h2>EA Competitive Gaming Division</h2><p>Founded in 2015, the EA CGD focuses on growing esports competitions through games like EA Sports FC and Battlefield.</p><h2>SEED</h2><p>The Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division is EA's incubator for research and development on new technologies, with offices based in Los Angeles and Stockholm.</p><h2>EA Platforms and services</h2><p>In addition to its PC distribution EA App, there's also the subscription service EA Play that's available as a standalone service or as part of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

                <p>As part of Call of Duty: Next today, Activision and Treyarch hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>'s post-launch support, which begins with Season 1. It will be the "biggest in franchise history" as it relates to a Season 1 for a new Call of Duty game, the developer said.</p><p>Specifically, there will be <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1973074806607405487" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven more 6v6 maps</a> added to Black Ops 7 multiplayer in Season 1, along with two new Zombies Survival maps, and one new round-based Zombies map. There could also be new Call of Duty: Warzone content as well.</p><p>Activision historically releases Call of Duty's seasonal content over time and not all at once, often divided between content available at launch and then down the road in a Reloaded update.</p><p>Fans don't have to wait until Season 1 for a new map, though, as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-brings-back-iconic-nuketown-map-and-heres-when/1100-6535119/" data-ref-id="1100-6535119"> latest iteration of Nuketown will arrive prior to Season 1.</a> Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps, including 16 6v6 maps and two maps for the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><h2><strong>When does Season 1 start?</strong></h2><p>Activision did not say when Season 1 will begin. For comparison, last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/" data-ref-id="1100-6527587">Black Ops 6 had its own Season 1 begin on November 14, 2024.</a> The game released on October 25, 2024, so Season 1 debuted 20 days after the game launched. If a similar timeframe follows for Black Ops 7, then Season 1 could start around early December, but nothing is confirmed at this stage.</p><p>All of the post-launch maps are free, but it's expected that Black Ops 7 will have its own in-game store filled with things people can buy with real money. We may not see as many outrageous and wacky skins, however, as Activision has said it might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">shifting focus away from those kinds of skins.</a> Black Ops 6's skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">won't carry forward to Black Ops 7, either. </a></p><p>Fans will get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">try Black Ops 7's multiplayer during a beta</a>, which begins on October 2 and continues through October 8. The full game, meanwhile, launches on November 14.</p>
