                <p>CD Projekt Red has lined up its next crossover collaboration. The publisher has announced that Morefun Studios' tactical extraction FPS Arena Breakout Infinite will be teaming up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in the near future.</p><p>A teaser for the crossover was shared on Cyberpunk 2077's social media accounts with a short look at what may be a cosmetic element in the collaboration. However, no further details were shared about what to expect from Cyberpunk 2077 x Arena Breakout Infinite or when it will be released.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 has previously had crossover collaborations with Balatro, Rocket League, and Fortnite. And while CD Projekt Red is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-wants-studio-to-harness-the-scrappy-energy-that-made-witcher-3-so-successful/1100-6532438/" data-ref-id="1100-6532438">currently focusing on The Witcher 4</a>, the publisher recently shared the details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-notes-new-auto-driving-cars-improved-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6533203/" data-ref-id="1100-6533203">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3</a>.

                <p>Despite the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a> not yet being officially announced, EA and DICE have now confirmed an open beta for Battlefield 6. Not only is an open beta coming, but the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Battlefield account said</a> the game's beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734">Each class in Battlefield 6 will have signature weapons</a>, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-battlefield-6-could-be-revealed-and-its-soon/1100-6533290/" data-ref-id="1100-6533290">officially unveiled on July 31, according to a report</a>, and it's also at this time that DICE may share more details about the open beta. Online speculation suggests the open beta could begin in August, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Battlefield 6, which is scheduled to launch by March 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">As always, a new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass packed with cosmetics. There will likely be more Black Ops 6 events and crossovers as well. Season 4 was cartoon-themed with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/">American Dad</a> collaborations, but it's uncertain what theme could arrive with Season 5. Call of Duty has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-operator-knows-what-you-did-last-summer/1100-6533292/">operator collab is the Fisherman</a> from I Know What You Did Last Summer, so this could be Season 5's first crossover news, but it's possible the operator bundle arrives before Season 4 ends.</p><p dir="ltr">The new weapons haven't been officially revealed, but <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog/status/1940450354266800365" rel="nofollow ">leaks suggest</a> Season 5 could include the return of the iconic MP-40 submachine gun and the M60 light machine gun. The game files also mention melee weapons such as the chainsaw, boxing gloves, and brass knuckles. Of course, these are weapons that could be saved for another season or scrapped all together.</p><p dir="ltr">The operator Sims was also found in the recent game files, suggesting he could be the Season 5 battle pass operator.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417"></a><figcaption>Zombies crew in Shattered Veil cutscene</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 multiplayer will likely feature new maps and game modes in Season 5, but we don't have those details yet. As for Zombies, the most recent Call of Duty podcast episode confirmed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final map will launch with Season 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This brings a conclusion to the ongoing storyline for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">Shattered Veil main quest</a>, the Zombies crew and Edward Richtofen will face off against S.A.M. in a setting that takes place in or around the Janus Towers location of Liberty Falls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk returned in Season 3, and the map has slowly evolved to mimic updates of the original map. This added the moving train, opened up the Train Station interior, and included several Easter eggs. While not confirmed, Stadium's rooftop is expected to open up with Season 5 and include playable areas for the interior. Data miners also found <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1940521748715471055" rel="nofollow ">references in the game files</a> to back up the speculation, with new map locations for a boardroom and computer room within Stadium. There's also mention of some type of lockdown for Stadium. It's uncertain if this is a location, event, or tied to an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is officially announced, and a full reveal is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month</a>, but it's possible there could still be some sort of in-game Warzone event tied to the big announcement. Warzone events have been used in the past to create hype around new Call of Duty releases.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Season 5 trailer, more teasers, and a full roadmap will likely arrive near the start of August, and we'll update as new information releases.</p>

                <p>Switching between playing games on different Xbox devices is about to get a little easier, as Microsoft has introduced a new Play History feature that makes it simple to see what games you've played across any Xbox device.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/21/now-available-for-xbox-insiders-your-cross-device-play-history-and-easier-access-to-your-cloud-playable-console-games-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the new feature will start rolling out today for Xbox Insiders. On the Xbox device's homescreen, a new list titled "Jump Back in" will appear with games that have been played recently on your current device. This is basically how it already works on consoles, with the tiles displaying recently used games and apps, but is new to the Xbox PC app.</p><p dir="ltr">New to both consoles and PC devices is the "Play History" button. At the end of the Jump Back in list (or on the far right side of the recently-played games and apps list on console) is an entire Play History category that will show games played across all devices. For those who bounce between console, PC, or a Windows handheld, the feature should make it faster to dive back into a game previously played on another device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409" data-ratio="0.56410256410256" data-width="624" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png" data-ref-id="1300-4535409"></a><figcaption>A look at the new Jump Back in and Play History tiles added to the Xbox app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4535409-xboxplayhistoryupdateui.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Xbox with this latest Insider update has also added the ability to filter games by "cloud playable" on the Xbox PC app, making it easier to see what games can be played straight from the cloud without the need to download them.</p><p dir="ltr">To join the Insider program and get updates and other new features early, you just need to download the Xbox Insider app on console or through the Microsoft Store on PC and opt-in to either the Xbox Update Preview or the PC Gaming preview, depending on what platform you are on.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has made a big multi-device push in the last year, with a marketing campaign that declares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">Xbox is more than just a console</a> and that any Windows device can be an "Xbox". Earlier this summer, Microsoft revealed an Xbox branded PC handheld, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, that is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">major layoffs</a> that resulted in around 9,000 people losing their jobs earlier this month, including many who worked at Xbox studios, resulting in cancellation of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>.</p>
