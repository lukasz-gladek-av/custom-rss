                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> has only been out for two weeks, but EA has already prepared the first update for this year's edition. Most of the changes address bugs or other issues that have come up since the game officially launched on August 14. It's also introducing Nike Rivalries, a new feature that will bring "community pride" to some of the most famous rivalries in the league.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA</a>, Nike Rivalries is part of a new four-year deal between Nike and the NFL that will "celebrate football's most storied rivalries" with customized uniforms that represent their respective cities. Each iteration of Nike Rivalries will focus on teams from two different divisions, and this year's subjects are the AFC East and NFC West.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728"></a><figcaption>Players from the NFC West and AFC East show off their custom looks in Nike Rivalries.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg"></figure><p>EA also announced that the Madden NFL 26 update will introduce a customized playbook that was created in collaboration with retired quarterback Kurt Benkert. The playbook is called Benkert's Dimes, and it's available in Play Now when selecting playbooks.</p><p>The remaining issues addressed in this update are largely specific to certain plays or situations. Additionally, EA notes that it will address a few other fixes in later updates, including the Class Import Process incorrectly modifying player body types, the inability to take players off of the IR list, and nose tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</p><p>The complete list of changes in Madden NFL 26's first update can be found below:</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Cover 2 Tampa - The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3x1 formations.</p><p>Cover 2 Hard Flats - Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</p><p>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</p><p>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms - Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</p><p>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</p><p>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</p><p>Addressed a visual issue around the previous play graphic obscuring the offensive play call formation.</p><h3>Franchise</h3><p>Addressed our UI Transitions surrounding the Player Card. Reducing the transition time it takes to go into the Player Card.</p><p>Dev Notes: This current fix only addresses going into the Player Card. Our resolution for exiting out of the player card back to the Franchise Main Menu will be in our next TU.</p><p>Resolved an issue allowing commissioners to send multiple league invites simultaneously.</p><p>Addressed an issue that prevented Edge Players from adding Pass Rushing Traits</p><p>Addressed an issue during the Draft where the Draft Board was improperly transparent, showing through to the background.</p><h3>Title Update</h3><p>Class Import Process incorrectly modifying Player Body Types, specifically Offensive Linemen.</p><p>Players on IR unable to be peeled off the IR list.</p><p>Nose Tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</p><h3>Superstar Mode</h3><p>Fumble rate chance has been decreased in Snow Games.</p><p>Fixed an issue where players would play in the wrong position.</p><p>Fixed a rare issue where players’ knees would be invisible during the NFL Combine.</p><p>Several stability fixes.</p><h3>Ultimate Team</h3><p>Play A Friend will now respect each individual users passing settings</p><p>Remedied an issue where opening a Fantasy Pack after a H2H game caused visual artifacts during the pack open</p><p>Fixed an issue where rewards images failed to appear on some screens</p><p>Fixed multiple occasions where players were navigated to the wrong menu</p><p>Fixed a text issue where “Rank Down” appeared instead of “Rank Up”</p><p>Fixed an issue where progress in Ranked was not visually displaying</p><p>Fixed multiple occasions of overlapping text</p><p>Fixed an occasional crash when returning to lobbies</p><p>Items displayed during presentation did not always match their actual rarity</p><h3>Audio</h3><p>Fixed an issue where commentary referred to a few rookies by an incorrect last name.</p>

                <p>Earlier in 2025, Square Enix executives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-its-plan-to-reboot-the-company-over-the-next-three-years/1100-6531527/" data-ref-id="1100-6531527">shared their desire to "reboot" the company</a> over the next three years. However, not every game will make it out to the other side of that time frame. Two mobile games from Square Enix's top franchises are set to be shut down in Japan at the end of October.</p><p>The impending ends of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-brave-exvius/" data-ref-id="5000-450306">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a> and Dragon Quest of the Stars were confirmed in Square Enix's <a href="https://x.com/FFBE_JP/status/1959873628691939371" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> <a href="https://x.com/hoshidora_info/status/1959874494463635469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posts</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-shutters-two-ten-year-old-mobile-games-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>). Both titles originally launched in 2015, although Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius was shut down outside of Japan last year and Dragon Quest of the Stars was closed internationally in 2021. Now, both games are getting delisted on October 31. In-app purchases for each title have also been suspended.</p><p>Before the final shutdown goes into effect, Dragon Quest of the Stars will reach its 10th anniversary on October 15, followed by Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius on October 22.</p><p>According to Final Fantasy XI director Yoji Fujito,, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-considered-ending-support-this-23-year-old-game-but-too-many-people-still-play-it/1100-6531645/" data-ref-id="1100-6531645">Square Enix also wanted to shut down that 23-year-old game</a> last year. However, Final Fantasy XI was spared because there are still too many people who play the MMO. Outriders fans weren't as lucky. Developer People Can Fly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/outriders-2-was-canceled-after-issues-with-publisher-square-enix-report/1100-6532913/" data-ref-id="1100-6532913">reportedly wanted to make Outriders 2</a> before the company was overruled by is publisher, Square Enix. People Can Fly was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-developer-cancels-games-layoffs-coming/1100-6531972/" data-ref-id="1100-6531972">subsequently hit by layoffs</a> and Outriders 2 was said to be one of two canceled projects in the wake of those departures.</p><p>There are still some fresh games coming from Square Enix, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales/" data-ref-id="5000-688786">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, which is a brand-new HD-2D action-RPG that will hit Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2026.</p>

Both battles appear to be from different parts of the game, allowing you to try out both basic and advanced abilities. The first fight is against the Rose Queen, a quick enemy who deals out "flurries of rapid strikes." You can try out some late-game abilities and a two-handed greatsword in the second boss battle against Holy Knight Commander Victor and the Ancient Mecha. Keep in mind that your progress in the demo will not transfer to the full game.</p>
