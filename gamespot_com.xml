                <p>Late last year, players noted that images of Tencent's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/" data-ref-id="5000-652952">Light of Motiram</a>, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">a very striking resemblance</a> to Sony's Horizon games. Sony noticed as well and subsequently filed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493"> a lawsuit against Tencent</a>. Now, Tencent is arguing that Sony's lawsuit has no merit and that the case against it should be dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, Tencent's motion to dismiss accuses Sony of attempting to "fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain." Tencent's position is that Sony's claim that Horizon Zero Dawn is "like no fictional world created before [or] since" is contradicted by the game's developers and represents an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p><p>Tencent notes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> art director Jan-Bart Van Beek acknowledged the game's similarity to an earlier title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/" data-ref-id="5000-56869">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>, in a behind-the-scenes documentary. According to Tencent, Sony originally shelved Horizon over those similarities before ultimately producing the game.</p><p>Sony's original complaint cited a March 2024 meeting between the company and Tencent about a potential Horizon spin-off mobile game that was ultimately rejected by Sony. Tencent's motion to dismiss acknowledges that a meeting took place, but states, "no Tencent Holdings executives or employees were at this meeting," and adds that "Sony has failed to make a prima facie showing that any actions at this meeting caused harm to Sony."</p><p>The motion goes on to state that Tencent Holdings, Tencent America, and Proxima Beta U.S. should be dismissed from the lawsuit because Sony "cannot [specifically] substantiate the claims it brings against [them]." Light of Motiram is being developed by two Tencent-affliliated companies, Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., a subsidy based in Singapore.</p><p>Tencent also states that since Light of Motiram hasn't been released, "the alleged infringements have not occurred and may in fact never occur."</p><p>Shortly after Sony filed the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">Tencent changed several elements</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a>, and the Horizon-like imagery was removed. Light of Motiram is expected to be released in 2027.</p>

                <p>EA's newly launched Skate game is out now for free on PlayStation and Xbox consoles--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-skate-coming-to-switch-2-what-the-devs-have-said/1100-6534816/" data-ref-id="1100-6534816">there is no Switch 2 version</a>. In addition to the other existing skateboarding games on Switch 2, another game has now been confirmed for release on Nintendo's hybrid console.</p><p>Skate Story, an independent game developed by Sam Eng and published by Devolver, is coming to Switch 2 later this year. The game has a rad art style and story setup. You play as a demon in the underworld, and your body is made out of "glass and pain." The devil gave you a skateboard and your goal is to skate to the Moon and swallow it to escape hell.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51U0Wwcmf7A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/51U0Wwcmf7A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savor the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>Skate Story was announced earlier this year and is also headed to the PlayStation 5 and PC. An Xbox version has not been announced, however.</p><p>Skate Story will join the other skateboarding games on Switch and Switch 2, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 and 3+4, as well as Skate Bird, Skater XL, Session, and OlliOlli World.</p><p>As for EA's Skate, the game looks like a success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-passes-2-million-players-as-dev-fixes-a-major-issue/1100-6534849/" data-ref-id="1100-6534849">two million people playing in the first 24 hours.</a> The game is available in early access and will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-to-remain-in-early-access-for-a-year-will-stay-free/1100-6534814/" data-ref-id="1100-6534814">remain in that state for about a year. </a></p><p>If you're just getting started with the new Skate, check out the gallery below, which covers a few things you need to know before dropping in.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo Classics catalog available through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting a couple notable additions to its Game Boy Advance collection. Two third-party titles are joining the lineup.</p><p>Side-scrolling adventure Klonoa: Empire of Dreams and puzzle game Mr. Driller 2, both from Namco (now Bandai Namco), will be playable with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription beginning September 25.

The game's action consists of Klonoa defeating enemies with his Wind Ring, solving puzzles, and collecting stars. The Klonoa series has been largely dormant in recent years, with its last proper installment coming out in 2008 for the Wii (a remake of the first game) and remasters of the first two titles releasing in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mr-driller-2-review/1900-6123345/" data-ref-id="1900-6123345">Namco's 2000 title Mr. Driller 2</a> is a follow-up to the arcade puzzle game Mr. Driller. Players must drill and dig through multicolored blocks as they attempt to reach the goal and preserve their air supply. Both Mr. Driller 2 and Klonoa: Empire of Dreams were part of the Wii U's Virtual Console, so this isn't the first time either game has been re-released.</p><p>The announcement comes less than a week after Nintendo's last Direct presentation, which featured some shocking news about Nintendo Classics: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/" data-ref-id="1100-6534695">Virtual Boy games are coming</a> to the service. All 14 games in the Virtual Boy library are arriving on February 17, 2026, and they'll require an accessory to play.</p>
