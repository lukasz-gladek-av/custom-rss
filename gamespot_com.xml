                <p>No one likes waiting, especially when there's nothing to do to pass the time. Peak developer Landfall Games had that same thought when working on Peak's most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DillyDally update</a>. It adds a handful of activities to lobbies while waiting for other players to join, including a basketball hoop, photo booth, and chess pieces.</p><p>Players went straight to work with the chess pieces, but not according to official rules the classic game uses.</p><p>"My friend and I got bored after we finished a climb," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imanthony89/" rel="nofollow ">Imanthony89</a> in a post on the Peak subreddit. "Used all the chess pieces and bing bong. That's a queen and a few pawns above the rafters"</p><p>The update released last week, and social media was flooded with chess pieces stacked ceiling-high in the airport lobby over the weekend. Peak's physics system, which can lead to some quirky antics on climbs, turned out to be perfect for some extracurricular activities for the scouts.</p><p>Peak lobbies are set in airport waiting areas, as the game begins with a playful loading-screen plane crash that sets you and your friends off on your journey to summit a procedurally generated mountain. The climb is almost never easy, so it makes sense that scouts should have some fun while waiting in the terminal.</p><p>Landfall Games and publisher Aggro Crab have released a few updates since Peak became a massive hit when it launched in June. A new biome, the Mesa--complete with tornadoes, scorching heat, and scorpions--was added in August. Another biome has also been teased, but no confirmed details have been shared yet.</p>

                <p>As part of the Call of Duty: Next event today, Activision made a series of major announcements about the FPS franchise, including what's next for Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>To begin with, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s integration into Warzone will begin in Season 1, and this will include a brand-new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow. This is a smaller map than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982" data-ratio="0.55223880597015" data-width="2144" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982"></a><figcaption>Haven's Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The map takes place in Liberty Falls, which is the town from Black Ops 6 Zombies prior to the zombie outbreak. Given that timeline, the map doesn't include a zombies aesthetic and instead has a more vibrant color tone, along with many points of interest to explore. The map was designed and developed by High Moon Studios.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big Warzone news from Call of Duty: Next is that Warzone's very first map, Verdansk, is remaining the main map for Warzone going forward. It's not exactly the same map as you remember it, though, as two new POIs have been added: Factory and Signal Station.</p><p>Verdansk was the OG map for Warzone when the game launched in 2020. It remained playable until 2021 when it was removed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-discusses-verdansks-return-and-feedback-so-far/1100-6530838/" data-ref-id="1100-6530838">only to come back earlier this year.</a> Its return prompted a resurgence in Warzone players, so it's no surprise to see Activision stick with it.</p><p>There are gameplay updates in Warzone coming as well, including a limit of five attachments and no Wildcards. Additionally, tactical sprint has been removed and is now only available via the Sprinter perk. The combat roll ability from Black Ops 7 is also coming to Warzone through the Mountaineer perk. Finally, there is greater ground loot coming to Warzone. All of this was confirmed by Charlie Intel.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Warzone gameplay updates:</p><p>- Weapons: 5 attachments only, no Wildcards, Overkill by default <br>- Tactical Sprint removed, now in Sprinter Perk<br>- Combat Roll from BO7 added via Mountaineer Perk <br>- Greater ground loot, including curated weapon builds <a href="https://t.co/C1WWQKT8Z7" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/C1WWQKT8Z7</a></p></div>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973086382529691700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

Criterion Games has developed several Need for Speed titles, DICE is best known for its work on the Battlefield series, and Maxis made a name for itself with The Sims.</p><p>Then there's Motive Studio--a developer that has alternated between being a support studio and working on big projects like Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake--PopCap Games has developed several popular mobile titles, and Respawn Entertainment has been responsible for several of EA's best single-player games in the modern era.</p><p>BioWare has a storied history, but after mass layoffs at the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, it's not certain what state the famed studio is in. Work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-team-should-scapegoat-dragon-age-to-get-more-resources-former-bioware-dev-says/1100-6533885/" data-ref-id="1100-6533885">new Mass Effect game</a> has been going on for several years now, but the high-profile flop of Anthem and underwhelming sales for Dragon Age: The Veilguard have left people wondering what its future looks like under a privately owned EA.</p><p>The studios listed above are just the tip of the EA iceberg, as the company also has Skate developer Full Circle, EA Gothenburg, Codemasters, and even more subsidiaries.</p><h2>EA Entertainment</h2><ul><li>BioWare (Includes BioWare Austin)</li><li>Criterion Games (Includes Criterion Cheshire)</li><li>DICE (Includes Frostbite Labs)</li><li>EA Baton Rouge</li><li>EA Galway in Galway, Ireland.</li><li>EA Gothenburg</li><li>EA Korea Studio</li><li>EA Capital Games</li><li>EA Redwood Studios</li><li>Firemonkeys Studios</li><li>Glu Mobile</li><li>Playdemic</li><li>Slingshot Games</li><li>Tracktwenty Studios</li><li>Full Circle</li><li>Maxis (Includes Maxis Texas and Maxis Europe)</li><li>Motive Studio (Includes Motive Studio Vancouver)</li><li>Pogo Studios</li><li>PopCap Games (Includes PopCap Shanghai and PopCap Hyderabad)</li><li>Respawn Entertainment (Includes Respawn Vancouver and Respawn Wisconsin)</li><li>Ripple Effect Studios</li></ul><h2>EA Sports</h2><p>The other jewel in the EA crown is its EA Sports division. Anchored by titles with annual soccer, Madden NFL, PGA Tour, and NHL games, recent years have also seen these respective titles become even more lucrative with live-service and online elements added to them.</p><h2>EA Sports studios</h2><ul><li>Codemasters (Includes Codemasters Birmingham and Codemasters Kuala Lumpur)</li><li>EA Cologne</li><li>EA Madrid</li><li>EA Orlando</li><li>EA Romania</li><li>EA Vancouver</li><li>Metalhead Software</li></ul><h2>Big game franchises</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>Throughout its existence, EA has amassed a sizable number of video game IP under its banner. Sure, a lot of these franchises like Army of Two and Titanfall haven't received new entries in years, but ownership of them is still potentially lucrative in an age of transmedia projects. Then there are the licensed IP that EA has worked on, with several Star Wars games under its belt--and more on the way--collaborations with smaller studios that have resulted in critically acclaimed games like Split Fiction being released under the EA Originals label, and various sports games that feature hundreds of official licensing deals to make them as authentic as possible.</p><ul><li>Battlefield</li><li>Need for Speed</li><li>Medal of Honor</li><li>Madden Football</li><li>EA Sports FC</li><li>The Sims</li><li>Mirror's Edge</li><li>Titanfall</li><li>Apex Legends</li><li>Mass Effect</li><li>Dragon Age</li><li>Dead Space</li><li>Plants vs Zombies</li><li>Command and Conquer</li><li>Skate</li><li>Army of Two</li><li>Bejeweled</li><li>Peggle</li></ul><h2>EA All Play</h2><p>EA's mobile-focused label, this part of the company is also involved in digital titles and digital board games.</p><h2>EA Competitive Gaming Division</h2><p>Founded in 2015, the EA CGD focuses on growing esports competitions through games like EA Sports FC and Battlefield.</p><h2>SEED</h2><p>The Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division is EA's incubator for research and development on new technologies, with offices based in Los Angeles and Stockholm.</p><h2>EA Platforms and services</h2><p>In addition to its PC distribution EA App, there's also the subscription service EA Play that's available as a standalone service or as part of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

                <p>As part of Call of Duty: Next today, Activision and Treyarch hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>'s post-launch support, which begins with Season 1. It will be the "biggest in franchise history" as it relates to a Season 1 for a new Call of Duty game, the developer said.</p><p>Specifically, there will be <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1973074806607405487" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven more 6v6 maps</a> added to Black Ops 7 multiplayer in Season 1, along with two new Zombies Survival maps, and one new round-based Zombies map. There could also be new Call of Duty: Warzone content as well.</p><p>Activision historically releases Call of Duty's seasonal content over time and not all at once, often divided between content available at launch and then down the road in a Reloaded update.</p><p>Fans don't have to wait until Season 1 for a new map, though, as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-brings-back-iconic-nuketown-map-and-heres-when/1100-6535119/" data-ref-id="1100-6535119"> latest iteration of Nuketown will arrive prior to Season 1.</a> Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps, including 16 6v6 maps and two maps for the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><h2><strong>When does Season 1 start?</strong></h2><p>Activision did not say when Season 1 will begin. For comparison, last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/" data-ref-id="1100-6527587">Black Ops 6 had its own Season 1 begin on November 14, 2024.</a> The game released on October 25, 2024, so Season 1 debuted 20 days after the game launched. If a similar timeframe follows for Black Ops 7, then Season 1 could start around early December, but nothing is confirmed at this stage.</p><p>All of the post-launch maps are free, but it's expected that Black Ops 7 will have its own in-game store filled with things people can buy with real money. We may not see as many outrageous and wacky skins, however, as Activision has said it might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">shifting focus away from those kinds of skins.</a> Black Ops 6's skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">won't carry forward to Black Ops 7, either. </a></p><p>Fans will get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">try Black Ops 7's multiplayer during a beta</a>, which begins on October 2 and continues through October 8. The full game, meanwhile, launches on November 14.</p>
