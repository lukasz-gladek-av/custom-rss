                <p dir="ltr">Today, NetherRealm Studios hosted the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xHLNtlfsw">Kombat Kast</a>--the semi-regular livestream highlighting new characters and features coming to Mortal Kombat 1 in the near future. Though Halloween was last month, the presentation kept the scares going with a full reveal of Ghostface from Scream, along with an interesting twist: The character is actually <em>three</em> Ghostfaces in one, and two of them are from the Mortal Kombat universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast started with the gameplay trailer for the new fighter, which showed off multiple moves and combos, a fourth-wall-breaking Fatality, and a tease at his Animality where he morphs into a buzzard. After the trailer, it was explained that the original Ghostface--the one transported to the Mortal Kombat timeline--is the main fighter, but he can call other Ghostfaces into battle for him.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Ghostface DLC Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Those other Ghostfaces--per NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback--are "not anonymous," but instead are known characters from the Mortal Kombat canon. The only clues given during the stream were that both were recruited from Kano's Black Dragon clan, and that the male Ghostface is called "Black Dragon Enforcer" and the female is "Black Dragon Assassin." Each of the Black Dragon Ghostfaces have "clues" and "Easter eggs" that present while they're on-screen, and it will be up to the players to figure out who is who.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast also revealed new features and adjustments to the roster, including new moves and abilities for Ashrah, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, among others. A replay takeover was also highlighted, where players can rewatch a recent online match and "take over" for a brief period of time, in order to analyze the situation and strategize for future matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ghostface will officially join the roster on November 26, while those with early access through the Premium or Kollector's Edition will be able to play as the Scream killer one week sooner on November 19.</p>

                <p>Last year, quality-assurance workers at Bethesda and ZeniMax studios formed ZeniMax Workers United, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">the largest certified video game union</a> in the United States. Now that union is putting its collective power to the test in a brief strike against Bethesda and ZeniMax's parent company, Microsoft.</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United has been attempting to negotiate a deal with Microsoft over remote-work requirements while also limiting the number of outsourced QA workers who can be brought in on Bethesda's projects. The union didn't say who Microsoft is outsourcing QA work to, but it accused the company of ignoring requests to negotiate.</p><p>"They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it's become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked," QA test lead Rhyanna Eichnersaid told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>.</p><p>This one-day strike was called in an attempt to make Microsoft more receptive to addressing the union's concerns.</p><p>"Striking isn't fun or ideal, but there's a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions," noted senior QA tester Juniper Dowell. "Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table."</p><p>According to Dowell, many of the QA testers were hired during the COVID pandemic when remote work was more prevalent. Microsoft's current requirements call for QA workers to be in the office two days a week, while the union is asking for a more flexible remote policy.</p><p>After the strike began, Microsoft issued a statement affirming the company's willingness to "listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quote from MS rep to me re: today's ZeniMax strike (over remote work, outsourcing): "We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today. We will continue to listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table.” <a href="https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2</a></p>  — Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>If the one-day strike fails to motivate Microsoft to make any concessions or changes, it could lead to a longer strike in the future.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's in-game store gets stocked with all manner of microtransactions tomorrow, November 14, to kick off the game's Season 1. And included among them is the BlackCell bundle, which features Goliath as its headlining hero. Goliath is one of the most unique Call of Duty operators to date.</p><p>Goliath has a "molten, crystalized skull" whose armor emits flames. As you can see in the trailer below, Goliath is a menacing force to be reckoned with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgDL9clbEdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AgDL9clbEdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>BlackCell bundles are Call of Duty's most expensive in-game offerings, coming in at around $30. For that price, purchasers get a new Operator, along with 20 Battle Pass tier skips, an allotment of 1,110 COD Points to spend on other stuff, and exclusive guns. For the Season 1 BlackCell DLC, this includes the "Boiling Point" assault rifle that is actually dripping with fire. It also comes with the "Who's Laughing Now" finishing move in which Goliath's hyena companion comes in and tears your enemy apart. The bundle also includes a special BlackCell clan tag to show off in lobbies and winner's cricles.</p><p>Beyond all of this, BlackCell owners get BlackCell-exclusive skins for Sev, Bayan, Bailey, Carver, Alvarez, and Stone, along with six BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints. People who buy the BlackCell DLC can also unlock any single page of the Battle Pass and bypass the normal requirements.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is, at long last, getting player housing. Blizzard confirmed during its recent Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct that the long-asked-for feature will be part of the MMORPG's future Midnight expansion, saving the biggest crowd-pleasing announcement of the livestream for last.</p><p dir="ltr">In a short teaser video, a Death Knight walks into a nondescript house. Inside, the walls are adorned with the head of the dragon Onyxia, various weapons and shields, a miniature Goblin shredder mech, and more. The weary adventurer puts down their sword, settles into a chair by the fire, and takes a sip from a mug adorned with the words "Home Sweet Home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's about all there is to go on, but GameSpot did get the chance to chat with WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas prior to the anniversary livestream about the big news. He confirmed the feature has been in the works for several years.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've definitely given some cagey and evasive answers about 'housing ever?' while knowing secretly it was going to come to pass," Hazzikostas said. "We've known we've wanted to do it for real for some time. I think figuring out the how and when and making sure we can deliver something that's going to meet our players' expectations and exceed them, that's all the tricky parts to it. What we're announcing this week is a teaser, a hint, the slimmest of previews, just letting people know, 'Hey, it's coming as part of Midnight.'"</p><p dir="ltr">He said much more information will come over the course of the next year, but that the team is excited to have it out in the open so they can start to hear what players want from digital housing in Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just excited to get that news out there and to begin a conversation so we can start hearing from players what they're hoping to see from a World of Warcraft housing system," Hazzikostas said. "Double-check it matches what we are currently cooking but also gives us some time to pivot and make sure we deliver what players are hoping for."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398397"></a><figcaption>More about Midnight will be revealed next summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">next three WoW expansions all at once</a> and said it hoped to start delivering expansions at a faster pace than its normal two-year expansion cycle. According to Blizzard's newly revealed 2025 WoW content roadmap, Midnight is not coming next year, though more details about the expansion will be revealed next summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Hazzikostas noted that even though Midnight isn't coming next year and players will still be playing The War Within in 2025, the team is dedicated to keeping the game's update cadence going at a steady pace while still getting a full-fledged new expansion ready "in a timely manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Players housing in WoW was just one of many Warcraft-related announcements to come out of the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Stream.

                <p>On November 12, Sony published a marketing trailer for the PlayStation 5 that ended with the announcement that the digital PS5 Slim would be marked down for the holidays. That trailer has since been edited and re-uploaded to remove all mention of the temporary discount.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiNPo7KvWCM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The trailer originally stated</a> that the digital PS5 Slim would be on sale until December 24 for $380. The system originally launched for $400 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-slim-playstation-5-models-announced-all-digital-sees-50-price-increase/1100-6518283/" data-ref-id="1100-6518283">Sony raised the price to $450</a>.  Bringing it down to $380 for the holidays is a nice offer, and hopefully it comes back. <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1855671773330579913" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft already slashed the price of the Xbox Series X by $50 for the holidays.</a></p><p>The video has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiNPo7KvWCM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since been re-uploaded</a>, with many commenters poking fun at Sony for editing out mention of the deal.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Sony to try to find out what's going on here.</p><p>Companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo typically offer discounts on their consoles and games for Black Friday and the wider holiday shopping season, and it's expected Sony will eventually roll out a PS5 discount.
