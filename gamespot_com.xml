                <p>Are you curious about New Game Plus in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251"><strong>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</strong></a>? This mode is a staple in soulslike and role-playing games, letting you restart your adventure with the goodies that you've found during your first playthrough. That said, there are some caveats that might surprise you with how Wuchang handles this concept. Oh, and before we continue, please be reminded that this article contains <strong>minor spoilers</strong>.</p><h2>What to expect in New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2><p>New Game Plus mode is unlocked after completing the campaign and obtaining an ending. After the end credits roll, you'll be sent back to the main menu. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show an image just yet, but you should see an option called "Causality Reversal," which is the term that the game uses for New Game Plus mode.</p><h3>Should you start New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>Here's the surprising part: You're actually <em>forced</em> to start Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode after beating the game.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you pick "Causality Reversal," "Continue," or "Load Game." All these options bring you back to the game's intro for a New Game Plus run. <strong>Worse, your original save file will be overwritten, too</strong>.</p><p>This can be a bit problematic, especially if you missed a few items or spells during your initial playthrough. It's also different from how other games handled this feature--i.e. there's an option to try New Game Plus via the main menu, but you can still load your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239"></a><figcaption>Wuchang wakes up in the same cave upon starting New Game Plus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Is there a way to avoid New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>If you're not ready yet for New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, you need to have a backup save before you conclude the campaign. This is how we did our workaround for the PC (Steam) version of the game:</p><ul><li>Prior to obtaining an ending, we exited the game so we could have a backup of the save state.</li><li>The files/folders that you need are in the "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Project_Plague" directory.</li><li>Copy the whole "Saved" folder and place it somewhere else.</li></ul><p>If you need to revert to a previous state, simply place the "Saved" folder in the "Project_Plague" directory and overwrite everything there. Then, launch Wuchang and pick "Load Game" from the main menu.</p><p>The save file might say "Causality Reversal 1"--i.e. New Game +1--but that's fine. This is mostly due to cloud functionality. Upon loading it, you should find yourself at the same spot as your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240"></a><figcaption>Items that can't be duplicated grant you Red Mercury blood resources instead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg"></figure><h3>What carries over and what changes in New Game Plus?</h3><p>Here's what you can expect in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode:</p><ul><li>You carry over all your equipment/gear pieces, Red Mercury, unlocked skills, spells, temperance needles, and the like.</li><li>Enemies will be tougher this time around.</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-jade-pendants-guide/2900-6798/" data-ref-id="2900-6798"><strong>Jade Pendants</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-benedictions-guide/2900-6799/" data-ref-id="2900-6799"><strong>Benedictions</strong></a> that you pick up have a +1 coefficient, which means their effects are more potent.</li><li>Vendors still sell the same items. You can't purchase stuff that can't have duplicates--i.e. spells.</li><li>If you loot items that can't have duplicates--i.e. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-manna-vase-upgrades-forgotten-remembrance-lost-remains-guide/2900-6791/" data-ref-id="2900-6791"><strong>Manna Vase upgrades</strong></a> and spells--you'll receive Red Mercury-related materials instead.</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bamboo-shoots-panda-guide/2900-6794/" data-ref-id="2900-6794"><strong>Panda Bamboozlings/Bamboo Shoots</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-inner-demon-manifestations-spawn-locations-guide/2900-6795/" data-ref-id="2900-6795"><strong>Inner Demons</strong></a> that you killed before will respawn in the same locations.
