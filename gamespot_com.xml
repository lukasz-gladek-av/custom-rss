                <p>In the 21 years since World of Warcraft launched, one feature has been asked about and requested above all others: player housing. Despite being the premier MMORPG for over two decades, housing in WoW has always felt like a pipedream. Now, that dream is finally a reality, as an early-access version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/">player housing is launching December 2</a> for those who preorder WoW's eleventh expansion, Midnight.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a long time coming. Housing as a feature was experimented with in WoW's earliest days but never came to fruition. In 2014, WoW's Warlords of Draenor expansion gave players a taste of what a full-fledged player housing system could be in the form of Garrisons. These large, base-like personal towns met nearly all of a player's needs in one location.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But Garrisons quickly became more of a lesson in what Blizzard shouldn't do when it came to player housing. Barely customizable, Garrisons were also extremely isolating. With access to so many amenities in one, private location, players didn't need to be out in the world or hanging out in one of WoW's capital cities. Garrisons whetted players appetites for housing, but whenever Blizzard was asked about when a proper housing system might arrive, it always replied that it wanted to do the feature justice and was waiting for the right moment to make it happen.</p><p dir="ltr">That time is, at long last, now. Blizzard is hoping to not only avoid the pitfalls of Garrisons but also those of other MMOs with its take on virtual-home ownership. Ahead of housing's early-access launch on December 2 as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch, GameSpot had the chance to sit down with WoW housing principal game designer Jesse Kurlancheek and housing senior UX designer Joanna Gianulis to discuss what it's like to work on the most-anticipated feature in WoW history and the philosophy behind Blizzard's approach. We also dive into aspects of Blizzard's housing plans that players have some concerns about, like why Blizzard opted to tie a progression system to housing and why it thinks a controversial new premium currency used to buy housing items on the game's shop is necessary.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A Home For Everyone</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">WoW hasn't stopped being the top MMO on the block since its release in 2004, but plenty of its rivals beat it to the punch when it came to housing. Games like Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn, The Elder Scrolls Online, New World, and even Old School RuneScape all have their own take on player housing.</p><p dir="ltr">While every game approaches housing differently, WoW's version of the feature immediately differentiates itself in one, huge way--everyone who wants a house can easily get one. In FF14, houses are costly and limited in number, with players having to enter a lottery for the chance to buy one. Snagging a starter home (or rather, a starter room) in ESO is fairly easy, but a larger apartment, house, or mansion will cost players significantly more. The same applies in New World, where owners additionally have to pay taxes on their virtual real estate, lest they lose access to housing bonuses, the ability to decorate, or invite others to their digital homestead. In Old School RuneScape, houses cost money depending on the location, with additional rooms costing even more.</p><p dir="ltr">By comparison, a house in WoW costs a measly 1,000 gold to purchase. That may have been a pretty penny back in the vanilla WoW days, but in 2025, players can easily snag close to 1,000 gold from a single World Quest. Houses are, effectively, free.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, size doesn't matter in Azeroth (at least when it comes to houses). Homes all cost the same, regardless of where they are located in the housing neighborhood or what they look like on the outside. On the inside, players can have a small, single room or a lavish, multistory mansion. It's all up to players, and it's all the same price (though furnishing a massive home is another story entirely). If someone has already built a house in a spot coveted by another player, they can simply travel to another neighborhood where that housing plot is open. There is no scarcity or competition here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614050" data-ratio="0.56236559139785" data-width="1860" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614050"></a><figcaption>Razorwind Shores is the zone where Horde players will get to build their homes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Making a house easily available to every player who wanted one was always the goal from the very earliest design pitches for the modern incarnation of WoW housing, Kurlancheek said, so much so that it was the first bullet point on the first slide of the initial pitch presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea that someone who has been playing WoW for 21 years, who has thought of Azeroth as their home for that amount of time, to not have a home, just felt so wrong," Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Even attaching a 100,000 gold cost, a reasonable price tag for most longtime WoW players, could result in some newer players having to farm gold, something Kurlancheek said wouldn't "feel good." Blizzard didn't want to translate the stress of real home ownership, with taxes and mortgage payments, into Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't want to take chores from the real world and suffuse my online gaming with them," Kurlandcheek said. "That sort of accessibility, availability, of this new major pillar of WoW, it was really important for us to give everyone a shot."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Becoming A Housing Main</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Aside from making it available to every player, Blizzard also knew housing needed to scale to all types of players, from those content with having a one-room home with a table and a few chairs all the way to players who want to spend dozens of hours a week working on their dream mansion.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/">housing system's decorating tools</a> allow for both extremes. On the surface, decorating one's home can be extremely straightforward, with the ability to snap items and decorations to a grid using the basic decorating mode and call it a day. But for those who want to get into the nitty-gritty details, an advanced mode allows for all kinds of precision tools, like the ability to turn off object collision and resize and rotate items as players see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">"We worked really, really hard to get basic mode as comprehensive as we could and work as well as we could…but we ended up really wanting to add in the advanced mode for players who wanted to take that step and go that extra level," Gianulis said. "And we're all glad that we did."</p><p dir="ltr">The results already speak for themselves. Even in the Midnight alpha and beta, players wasted no time putting the housing decorating system through its paces, creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqeOW4Jjwos">feats of home engineering</a> that prove just how powerful Blizzard's tools can be in the right creative hands.</p><p dir="ltr">Striking that balance, of catering both to the players who may become housing "mains" and those who use it more casually, was a challenge, Gianulis said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We know a lot of WoW players, this is the game they play and they maybe haven't played other housing games," Gianulis said. "It should feel good to them, it should feel natural. They shouldn't have to learn how to play this whole new game within a game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614051"></a><figcaption>Concept art for what a Blood Elf-themed room can look like using WoW's housing system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/">Housing will have a progression system</a> to keep players leveling up their house's capabilities, with players over time unlocking new types of rooms, the option to add more rooms, and the ability to place more decor items within their house. The fact that some of these options have to be unlocked, rather than being available from the start, has been a debated topic among WoW's playerbase, but Kurlancheek said there is logic behind the system.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a fine line there," Kurlancheek said. "On day one, if you came in and literally every option was unlocked from the get go, you have all the space that's possible, it's overwhelming in a lot of ways. You get analysis paralysis…I have 10,000 decor I can place and a house that can have 50 rooms. That's kind of a lot to take in."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have played WoW for decades, they'll likely start with their house level at three or four, with more options and freedom from the get-go, Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We respect that past effort," Kurlancheek said. "But progression is ultimately still important. You still want to unlock the skybox room, unlock the night room, unlock these other aspects of housing. We still want you to have goals."</p><p dir="ltr">Housing is intended as an evergreen pillar of the game going forward, and as such, the house level system will continue to expand in future updates and expansions, Gianulis said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want it to feel like it's always been a part of the game and always will [be], so that means we're going to be adding maybe more house levels, maybe other things," Gianulis said.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Hearthsteel Debate</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">If there is one potential pitfall Blizzard may fall into with housing, it's in how it monetizes it. Blizzard was upfront early on with players that it would sell some housing-related items (though the majority of housing items are earnable in-game) on the in-game shop. This was expected. Blizzard has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/">sold various mounts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-cosmetic-bundle-comes-with-a-whopping-100-transmog-items/1100-6534786/">cosmetic items for real money on WoW's in-game shop</a> for over a decade at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">What wasn't known until more recently, however, was that those housing items would only be purchasable with a new premium currency called Hearthsteel. After a datamine revealed the currency, Blizzard attempted to explain its reasoning in an ill-received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/">blog post that attempted to justify the need for a premium currency</a> (something typically associated with mobile or free-to-play games, of which WoW is neither). The blog post stated that the use of Hearthsteel would make purchasing multiple, inexpensive items more "efficient" and that bundles of Hearthsteel available for purchase would align with item costs in a "player-friendly way."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614052"></a><figcaption>Players can preview premium housing items that cost Hearthsteel in the decorating interface.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Feedback to Hearthsteel has been largely negative, threatening to dampen the excitement surrounding the arrival of WoW's most-requested feature. When asked to further explain the need for Hearthsteel, and if Blizzard would be looking to rethink its approach, Kurlancheek echoed many of the blog post's points.</p><p dir="ltr">He said the currency was needed for convenience, as the Battle.net shop doesn't have a shopping cart feature to batch together multiple small purchases into one transaction. He also said there are "regulatory hurdles" Blizzard has to be mindful of when it comes to real-money purchases. Using Hearthsteel allows Blizzard to more easily issue refunds, as an example, instead of making players jump through hoops to return a chair they didn't like.</p><p dir="ltr">He said that Blizzard is attempting to be as "player friendly as possible" by aligning Hearthsteel amounts with item prices so that players won't have awkward amounts of currency left over or feel the need to strategically buy bundles in order to get the correct amount of currency.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's all been in service of making this a good experience for players," Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the need from Hearthsteel stems from the need to make multiple, small transactions more convenient, Kurlancheek said. When asked if players could instead pay a higher price to gain multiple, or even unlimited, uses of an item (as opposed to only being able to buy them one at a time), and thus eliminate the need for a virtual currency, Kurlancheek said he believed it would result in "inflated prices we don't feel good about charging."</p><p dir="ltr">It didn't sound like players should expect changes to Hearthsteel when housing launches, but Kurlancheek didn't close the door entirely on the subject.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think everything in housing is an iterative process," Kurlancheek said. "We listen to the feedback, we see what players are clamoring for, what's not working for them, what's causing friction, and so on, and I don't think the shop is any different."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not Hearthsteel will see changes, it's clear that the arrival of housing signals a new era for WoW, in more ways than one. Only time will tell how housing will evolve over time, but it's clear Blizzard has crafted a solid base for the feature to be built upon in the months and years to come, even if Hearthsteel could potentially become a major crack in housing's foundation.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW players who preorder Midnight can buy their home starting on December 2, and Blizzard has released a step-by-step housing guide for those looking to get started as soon as possible. The patch will also introduce a prologue questline for the next expansion and a revamped new-and-returning-player experience. As for Midnight proper, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion was recently revealed to be launching on March 2, 2026</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> players recently discovered an exploit that allowed them to loot locked rooms without needing a keycard. Naturally, the exploit quickly became popular--and frustrating for players who didn't use it--leading Embark Studios to apply a "hot" fix to this part of the game. If you now decide to cheese your way into one of these treasure rooms, you can now expect a toasty reception inside.</p><p>Using a keycard to access one of these rooms ties into the high-risk, high-reward nature of Arc Raiders, but the exploit essentially bypasses it. Players managed to break into the room, grab valuable gear without worrying about being ambushed, and pick the location clean. This meant that players who unlocked the room properly would find it stripped bare, leading to frustration within the Arc Raiders community.</p><p>To remedy this, Embark Studios made it so that the rooms automatically activate flamethrowers when you glitch into them. Players quickly found out that they would be caught inside this deathtrap, while other players with keycards would discover a room full of loot and a freshly cremated adventurer.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been a big hit since launch, selling millions of copies and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/">hitting a peak player count of 481,966 raiders on Steam</a>. Embark Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-most-op-perk-just-got-nerfed/1100-6536194/">regularly updated Arc Raiders</a>, fine-tuning the gameplay and nerfing overpowered perks.</p><p>"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter unlike any other, a totally unpredictable, immersive, thrilling story generator directed by the community," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">Arc Raiders review</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The test is to gather feedback on "combat improvements" like footstep audio updates that improve distance perception surface definition, and enemy audibility. Network and hit registration changes are also being tested that should result in "more consistent interactions and better responsiveness during close-quarters and higher-intestiy combat. Battlefield Studios also notes that there will be "broader adjustments across key combat systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The test will be PC only, and is accessible either through the EA app or Steam. Like previous Battlefield Labs tests, players will need to <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up</a> for the program beforehand and sign a non-disclosure agreement to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">While this latest test is short and sweet, developer Battlefield Studios added there will be more "quick, short-notice sessions" in the future to gain "rapid insights on focused gameplay changes," as well as bigger playtests that will focus on specific new features or content ahead of their final release.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the months ahead, we'll use Battlefield Labs to look at a broader range of early concepts and experimental scenarios that benefit from real player insight," Battlefield Studios stated. "Beyond that, we are preparing future Lab sessions that explore changes to map layouts, pacing, and alternative team compositions such as smaller player counts or vehicle-focused setups."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 has been a big success for EA, immediately becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's best-selling game in the US</a> by dollar sales and in franchise history.

                <p>It looks like Fortnite will borrow a feature from one of its competing battle royales, should recently surfaced leaks prove to be accurate. According to prominent Fortnite leaker Shiina, the Epic Games title is adding something very similar to the Gulag from Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>This feature is purportedly called "Restarter Island," and it'll have eliminated players compete in a random 1v1 minigames, with winners respawning back into battle royale matches. One of these minigames is a simple duel, similar to the Gulag system in Warzone, with another described as a best-out-of-three Rock, Paper, Scissors showdown.</p><p>Fellow Fortnite leaker Blortzen adds that other Restarter Island minigames include a "Shockwave Deathmatch," in which players have to use shockwave grenades to knock each other off, and sprint races between players, with one variation adding deadly baseball bats for competitors to use against each other.</p><p>Blortzen emphasizes that these leaked maps are in a "really really REALLY early state," <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1995200912252621021" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculating in an X post</a> that Restarter Island is either an upcoming addition to Fortnite or one that has been scrapped entirely. Shiina, conversely, seems confident enough to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1994896784154661265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">say that the mode is "COMING SOON."</a></p><p>This wouldn't be the first time the battle royale game has taken notes from one of its competitors--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-reboot-vans-will-be-very-familiar-to-ape/1100-6466155/" data-ref-id="1100-6466155">Fortnite added a respawn system</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-just-copied-apex-legends-ping-system/1100-6465276/" data-ref-id="1100-6465276">pinging</a> shortly after the release of Apex Legends, which innovated on the genre with those features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-reload-mode-is-live-exclusive-loot-available-for-those-who-like-a-challenge/1100-6524461/" data-ref-id="1100-6524461">Fortnite Reload is also very similar</a> to Warzone's own Resurgence mode.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the Hollywood-themed first season of Chapter 7 is now underway, reportedly attracting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-reportedly-propelled-the-game-to-3-million-concurrent-players/1100-6536598/" data-ref-id="1100-6536598">concurrent player count of around 3 million</a>, but also receiving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-think-theyve-found-ai-use-in-fortnite-chapter-7-but-artist-shows-its-not-cut-and-dried/1100-6536597/" data-ref-id="1100-6536597">accusations of using generative AI art</a>.</p>

                <p>Konami appears to be a little undecided on what to make next now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> is out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Another remake isn't totally out of the realm of possibility, and neither is something wholly brand new, but series producer Noriaki Okamura said that if Konami were to do another remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/" data-ref-id="5000-23469">Metal Gear Solid 4</a> would be a "pretty hard" one to do.</p><p>Speaking to the Japanese website <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Real Sound</a> (and machine translated by both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-series-producer-remakes-metal-gear-solid-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gears-producer-says-hes-undecided-on-future-remakes-mgs4-would-be-real-challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Okamura said that, while he'd love to build on the momentum that the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake gave him and Konami, the team is still at the decision-making stage about what comes next.</p><p>He expressed that another remake is possible, but so too is something entirely new. After all, with Metal Gear Solid alone, Konami has a rich history to pull from.</p><p>Okamura continued, saying that because much of the original Metal Gear Solid staff no longer works at Konami, the team isn't going to just apply the same coat of paint MGSD got to every remake it develops in the possible future. He was then asked about that future and if a Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots remake was something the team would consider pursuing. It's not a no, but Okamura said it wouldn't be an easy task, particularly because of the unusual designs required to get the 3D performance at the time. Modernizing those assets would be difficult, he concluded.</p><p>Snake Eater and Guns of the Patriots were released just four years apart, but they're actually 50 years from each other in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-games-in-order" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise's official chronological order</a>. If Konami were to consider remaking the series in the order its story goes, then the next game would be 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops/" data-ref-id="5000-26743">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a> for the PSP. (Though I'd personally love to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/" data-ref-id="5000-43546">Revengeance</a> remake/remaster.)</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta is out now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. We awarded it 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>, saying it "successfully modernizes visuals, tweaks game design, and updates controls so that the game sits comfortably alongside its action game contemporaries."</p><p>.</p>

A large voting jury made up of game critics and media decides 90% of the results. The remaining 10% comes from fan votes, so while that doesn't decide everything, your votes can still make a difference when the results are announced live on December 11. What's more, the first round of Players' Voice nominees have been revealed. These are picked exclusively by the general public.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, and fans in China can vote on Bilibili. Voting stays open until December 10, at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET. Anyone <a href="https://thegameawards.com/nominees/game-of-the-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who signs up</a> can vote in all 29 award categories, including Game of the Year.</p><p>On the official The Game Awards website, the organization outlines why the primary award categories are not 100% chosen by the general public.</p><p>"Creating a 100% fan vote presents several challenges. First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles," the organization says <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its website</a>. "In addition, it is important that winners cannot be 'socially engineered' in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners."</p><p>This year's event will celebrate many major games. The Game of the Year nominees are Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades II, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Expedition 33 leads with 12 nominations--the most in The Game Awards history--followed by Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei with seven each. Hades II earned six nominations, Hollow Knight has five, and Split Fiction has four.</p>
