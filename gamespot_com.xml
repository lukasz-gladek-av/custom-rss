                <p>After teasing an upcoming collaboration recently, Capcom has now revealed a special collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-6/" data-ref-id="5000-558635">Street Fighter 6</a>. Akuma will be added to the game on May 28, alongside a Blanka-Chan outfit for your Palico.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqhwCwLvffw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qqhwCwLvffw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Akuma and Blanka-Chan will be free for all players, you'll also have the option of adding Chun-Li and Cammy outfits to your MH Wilds experience as paid DLC on the same date. There are also brief teasers of weapon charms and emotes featuring various Street Fighter characters.</p><p>The Akuma full armor set will turn your character into the combat demon. In a trailer revealing the collaboration, Street Fighter-style graphics and narration can be heard, and although we're not certain that this will appear if you fell a monster as Akuma, it would be a great touch for fans of the franchise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207"></a><figcaption>We're hoping the trailer's Street Fighter-style narration comes with the collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png"></figure><p>Akuma can also be seen competing in the game's arm-wrestling tournaments and traversing the environment while yelling in his recognizable aggressive tone.</p><p>Alongside the Street Fighter collaboration on May 28, Monster Hunter Wilds will also see an additional tempered monster with other gameplay adjustments as part of update 1.011.

                <p>Elgato is introducing Stream Deck modules, the MK.2 Stream Deck, and new Virtual Stream Deck software. The Elgato Stream Deck, as the name suggests, was initially aimed at streamers as a way to quickly do things like manipulate on-screen stream elements without having to interrupt your stream by going to a separate app. Instead, a number of programmable buttons on the interface can be bound to certain apps, keybinds, and commands to achieve quick results, such as changing stream scenes or sending your audience to another creator's stream in a raid. It turns out, though, that there are lots of uses for such an idea.</p><p>Elgato's developer-friendly platform has long supported letting anyone do just about anything with a Stream Deck, but now it is looking to blow out that experience in a big way with its newest showings at Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module" data-collection="" title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato Stream Deck Module</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Stream Deck Module is a case of a company listening to its users and responding. Hobbyists have been ripping apart Stream Decks to use the buttons and front panel as parts of bigger projects, and the Module is for exactly those users. Available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and housed in an aluminum casing, these unbranded panels are intended to be integrated into those projects. The Module will be available for $49.99 for the six-key variant, $129.99 for the 15-key model, and $199.99 for 32-keys. </p>                      </div><p>Alongside the Modules, a $79.99 Stream Deck network dock will allow you to plug a Stream Deck in anywhere you have a network port, further opening the possibilities for use in things like smart home setups and other projects.</p><p>The MK.2 Stream Deck, available for $149.99, pushes things forward in a different way. If you've ever owned a Stream Deck--I use my six-key Stream Deck to control Spotify and switch audio devices--you know the keys can be kind of mushy. Since they're not meant to be used for typing, that's not so bad, but it can be hard to tell if you've actuated one of those keys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUcQNxSOGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvUcQNxSOGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The MK.2 swaps out the membrane beneath the current Stream Deck keys with scissor switches, which can be commonly found on laptop and other similarly low-profile keyboards. Elgato says this will provide "enhanced speed and precision," and "lends itself to typing-style interactions" that could pave the way for new Stream Deck use cases. Remember the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/popularis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Optimus Keyboard</a>, that striking keyboard that featured a screen on every key? It's not hard to imagine scissor switches allowing Elgato to move in the direction of making a full keyboard.</p><p>Finally, Elgato is bringing a software-only Stream Deck app to market for desktop systems. It's similar to the existing Stream Deck mobile app, which allows you to turn your phone or tablet into a soft Stream Deck. The software will be available at first to anyone with a physical Stream Deck, and will be bundled with the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse and Corsair Xenon Edge touchscreen--the Stream Deck 7.0 beta requires that you connect one of those devices for the VSD feature to be available. Notably, though, unlike its mobile equivalent, things like custom layouts and virtual faceplates won't be locked behind a paid subscription. Elgato says that the VSD software will be available with a greater range of hardware over time. We're also quite sure that no one is going to figure out a way to simulate owning a Stream Deck to make the software usable by anyone. No way at all.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lies of P Overture Director explains how the DLC will create a complete experience</p>
      </div>
<p>Once the update goes live alongside the Overture expansion, you will get to choose from two new gameplay difficulty options, Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet. The default difficulty level will be renamed to "Legendary Stalker" in the upcoming patch. For those of you looking for a greater challenge, will be able to take part in a boss rush mode that has several tiers of escalating difficulty. Additionally, the new Death March mode is a gauntlet of boss fights where your health and inventory will be more limited.</p><p>Difficulty options in souls-like games have been a polarizing topic for years now. Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer From Software typically refrains from adding such options to its games, while other studios allow a wider selection of options to make the experience more forgiving. Stellar Blade is a good example here, as the Sekiro-influenced game offers several difficulty modes and gameplay assists. On the extreme side, Steel Rising by developer Spiders has options that turns the game into a cakewalk.</p><p>Lies of P: Overture is expected to launch in summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Neowiz says you can expect it to take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-expansion-will-take-up-to-20-hours-isnt-related-to-that-cutscene/1100-6530393/">between 15-20 hours to complete</a>.</p>

                <p>Last year at the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152"> Roblox </a>Developers Conference, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lays-out-grand-plans-to-transform-the-platform/1100-6526340/" data-ref-id="1100-6526340">The Roblox Corporation laid out its grand plans for the platform</a> and unveiled its revamped revenue-sharing plans for developers who make premium experiences using its game creation tools. One of those games, Grow a Garden, has broken from the pack and become such a monster hit that it's drawing bigger numbers than most of the top games on Steam.</p><p><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grow a Garden</a> was released on March 25, and since that time it has had 1.9 billion visits, and over 1 million favorites. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Grow a Garden's concurrent player record is 5 million active users. At the time of writing, Grow a Garden is massively outperforming some of the biggest Roblox games of all time, including Dress to Impress, Blox Fruits, and Adopt Me, according to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1kpfm5v/the_top_50_games_by_peak_concurrent_player_counts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> showing top concurrent players. The identity of Grow a Garden's teenage creator has not been disclosed, but management of the game <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has been taken over by a studio called Splitting Point</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499176-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499176" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499176-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499176"></a><figcaption>Creating monstrous crops in Grow a Garden</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499176-image.png"></figure><p>The gameplay is relatively simple, as players are able to purchase seeds for their farm and let them grow to ridiculous sizes before harvesting and selling them for profit. Even the game's animals, or pets, can take on gigantic proportions, and come with unique abilities to buff the productivity of your garden. It's easy to see why so many are hooked on the gameplay loop.</p><p>Grow a Garden <a href="https://growagarden.fandom.com/wiki/Grow_a_Garden_Wiki" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has already spawned a wiki</a> on Fandom and users have shared numerous videos on YouTube and TikTok since it exploded in popularity. This game may not be a fully refined experience, but it's outlandish touches and easy-to-pick-up gameplay have clearly struck a chord with a large number of players.</p><p>One of Grow a Garden's advantages is that is an all-ages title and suitable for everyone on Roblox. The platform recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">put restrictions on kids in social hangouts</a>.
