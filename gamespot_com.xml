                <p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand has been officially revealed, and this action-RPG will see players take control of a skeletal warrior--who goes by the on-the-nose name of Cursed Sand--on a quest to rescue his beloved princess. Thanks to magical sand powers, the resurrected warrior stands a fighting chance against the monsters standing between him and the princess as he travels along the ancient Silk Road.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX46D-gW1Rk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sX46D-gW1Rk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/27/loulan-the-cursed-sand-is-coming-to-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a PS Blog post</a>, game director Hongwen Huai revealed that the design of Cursed Sand is inspired by the Loulan mummies and the desert sand of China's western regions. This resulted in developer ChillyRoom creating a "dual-form" protagonist, who wraps himself in golden sand to take on a human-like appearance. When he uses his powers, he shifts from Sand Form to Bone Form, which Huai described as a powerful stance built for one-against-many combat.</p><p>"On his journey, he will face powerful factions ranging from the Loulan royal family--who embody the power of the sun--to the frost-bound spiders of the Western Regions," Huai said. "We've reimagined iconic landscapes of the western region through a fantastical lens, from vast deserts to flowing rivers of sand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319"></a><figcaption>Loulan: The Cursed Sand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592320,1300-4592321,1300-4592322,1300-4592323,1300-4592324" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"></figure><p>Loulan: The Cursad Sand is one of several projects supported by Sony's China Hero Project. The team producing the game includes several veterans who have worked at Santa Monica Studio, From Software, and Platinum Games, and Huai added that Loulan uses a retro-inspired top-down camera perspective to blend classic arcade-style combat with modern gameplay ideas. Loulan doesn't have a release date yet, but it is coming to PC and PS5.</p><p>Several more games inspired by Chinese folklore are also currently in development.

                <p>In April 2022, developer and publisher Sharkmob officially launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt/" data-ref-id="5000-533058">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a>, a battle royale set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness. Players took control of vampires in Prague as they joined rival sects and battled each other with their supernatural abilities and conventional weapons. However, new updates for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1-year-later-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-shutting-down-servers-to-remain-online/1100-6514160/" data-ref-id="1100-6514160">ceased in 2023</a>, and now Bloodhunt's servers are going offline in 2026.</p><p>Sharkmob announced <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the news on its site</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt will have its final death on April 28, 2026. Once the game's servers go offline, the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of this title will no longer be playable.</p><p>In a message addressed to the Bloodhunt community, Sharkmob shared its gratitude for the game's four-year run.</p><p>"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did," reads the statement. "From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways. During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt ... However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable. This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline."</p><p>Token purchases have already been disabled, but the in-game store will remain open so players can use the tokens they already have before the game goes offline.</p><p>Earlier this month, the action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-ref-id="5000-494182">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There was a 21-year gap between this game and its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines/" data-ref-id="5000-18278">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</a>.</p>
