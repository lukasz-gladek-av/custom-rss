                <p>When single developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone officially released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> in 2016, the farm-life sim wasn't intended to have any voiceovers. That hasn't stopped a dedicated fan from creating a Stardew Valley mod that adds vocal performances to the game.</p><p>Voice actress and software engineer Shannon Hobby released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22550?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Stardew Valley voice over mod</a> as a proof of concept in 2024. But this week, Hobby has updated the mod with vocal performances for all of the romanceable characters in the game. Hobby's intent is give every character in the game a voice, but it's still a work in progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1f9o67Y5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z1f9o67Y5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm a voice actor and software engineer and I've combine these skills to make something wonderful for a game that I really care about that's super important to me and I know is important to a lot of people," said Hobby in her initial announcement video. "I think this was a perfect opportunity to combine those skill sets and make something that I'm proud of for a game that I really care about and give back to the community a little bit."</p><p>Hobby went on to explain that she is not using generative AI for the game's voices. Instead, all of the voices are provided by real people whom Hobby has paid out of her own pocket. She also shared the cast list below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JanFuzzball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Michelle</a> as Emily</li><li><a href="https://heiditabing.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heidi Tabing</a> as Penny</li><li><a href="https://thatdamvoice.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Meyers</a> as Sebastian</li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/@saiyanserenityv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemi Haydee Stanton</a> as Haley</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aiden_dawn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aiden Dawn</a> as Leah</li><li><a href="http://www.eamonkinsmanvo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eamon Kinsman</a> as Alex</li><li><a href="https://x.com/hopkinsjacob5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jacob Hopkins</a> as Sam</li><li><a href="https://www.gmhakim.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GM Hakim</a> as Harvey</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/TPOTcos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nia Celeste</a> as Maru</li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/animenji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmanuel "Menji" Menjivar</a> as Elliott</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DianaJurand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Jurand</a> as Abigail</li><li>Jonathan David Bullock as Shane</li></ul><p>Audio Editing Assistance was provided by Victoria Cheng. Hobby also notes that the mod still has some bugs to work through, including audio cues that don't always play when they should. </p><p>Last year, Stardew Valley received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-switch-2-edition-includes-mouse-controls-4-player-local-co-op/1100-6534697/">Switch 2 Edition</a>, and Barone announced a 1.7 update that will introduce a new farm type and more features. That update doesn't currently have a release date, but Barone has warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-1-7-update-is-going-to-take-a-while-before-it-releases/1100-6534909/">it's going to take "a while."</a></p>

                <p>How expensive can a game be while still feeling like you're only dropping five bucks on it? According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> co-creator Nick Kaman, $8 is the ideal price point for a $5 game.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Nick Kaman explained that the team had a $5 "joke" that actually ended up informing Peak's standard pricing. "We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?" he said. "In a player's mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that's still five bucks."</p>

<p>"Four bucks is also kind of five bucks. Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free," Kaman continued. "So we've got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks... that's ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn't become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal."</p><p>This "eight bucks is five bucks" joke originated in conversations between developers at Landfall and Aggro Crab, when developers from both studios were working together to create Peak. While Peak originally launched at a reduced price of $5, its standard price is $8, or more specifically $7.99, based on the pricing of Landfall's indie horror hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/content-warning/" data-ref-id="5000-624337">Content Warning</a>.</p><p>Even though Kaman's whole joke is kind of confusing and hard to follow, psychological pricing is a very real science in the business world, and the strategy seems to have paid off for Peak. The offbeat co-operative climbing game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">third best-selling game on Steam</a> over the holiday season, moving almost 800,000 copies in just two weeks.</p><p>Peak is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for $4.95--basically $5--which is the cheapest price the indie hit has sold for since it released in June.</p>

                <p>While you might be looking to reestablish your gym routine now that the festive season is over, at least you can count on your Switch 2 console having an extra layer of stability thanks to a new firmware update. Nintendo has rolled out a new system update for the Switch 2 that brings it up to version 21.2.0, and as you've probably guessed, it doesn't do much.</p><p>"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience," the very succinct <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update notes</a> read.</p><p>Since its launch, the Switch 2 has mostly focused on small updates like this to keep the console running smoothly for users. That's not to say there haven't been any substantial updates so far, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-and-switch-get-new-system-updates-and-they-add-more-than-just-stability/1100-6536122/">November firmware upgrade</a> added better visual clarity on the home menu to indicate whether a game is owned physically or digitally. The update also added GameChat improvements, helping to fine-tune the Switch 2.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">The Switch 2 got off to a strong start</a> last year after its June launch, smashing through several sales records along the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-reportedly-not-amazing-over-the-holidays/1100-6537274/">Sales in the US were reportedly down</a> by around 35% from November to December when compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017, and overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hardware-sales-in-the-us-just-had-worst-month-in-30-years/1100-6537041/">November 2025 was the worst month for hardware sales</a> in the US since 1995.</p><p>Nintendo still predicts to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by the end of March, and its early 2026 offerings include a substantial upgrade for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-waluigi-cries-waaaah-in-mario-tennis-fever/1100-6537275/">Mario Tennis Fever</a>.</p>
