<p dir="ltr">While the number of approved foreign games has increased in recent years due to the approval process now occurring monthly instead of every two months, there was a period from July 2021 to March 2022 when no new games were approved for release. Last month, China approved a record 158 new games for release--a multi-year high according to Chinese news outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/china-approves-158-new-game-licenses-in-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yicai Global</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big win for Blizzard, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-pc-titles-will-return-to-china-under-new-deal-with-netease/1100-6522533/" data-ref-id="1100-6522533">re-partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase in 2024</a> to re-release games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 in China following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-and-netease-breakup-came-after-bobby-kotick-felt-threatened/1100-6512792/" data-ref-id="1100-6512792">licensing disagreements</a> that saw many Blizzard's titles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/" data-ref-id="1100-6510829">including WoW</a>, go offline in the region for most of 2023 and some of 2024. It was during this period when many Blizzard games were unplayable in China that Diablo 4 released globally in June 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard and NetEase have not yet announced an official release date for Diablo 4 in China, but when it does arrive, it will likely include a number of changes from the version the rest of the world plays. Previous Blizzard games in China have operated on their own separate, region-locked clients and servers and often receive region-exclusive events and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chinese versions of Blizzard games often bring various content changes in order to conform to Chinese government regulations. In the case of Diablo 4, that will likely mean less gore, fewer skeletons, and the removal of certain religious references. One thing is for certain, the Diablo 4 Necromancer and their skeletal minions will almost certainly look different in the Chinese version.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Diablo 4 news, Blizzard seems poised to bring big changes to its flagship ARPG, as content creators were recently treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse of the game's future</a>.

                <p>Following Microsoft's latest mass layoffs that affected around 9,000 people--including dramatic cuts at Xbox--CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to staff that was shared on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's blog.</a> In the memo to staff, Nadella addressed what he called the "why, what, and how" of the decision to cut so many jobs.</p><p>Nadella said the decisions that led to the layoffs were "among the most difficult we have to make."</p><p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful," he said.</p><p>Nadella also addressed what he called the "seeming incongruence" of how Microsoft made these dramatic cuts at a time when business is booming. Nadella said Microsoft is "thriving" by "every objective measure," but he chalked the layoffs up to "the enigma of success."</p><p>"Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before," he said.</p><p>Also in the memo, Nadella said when Bill Gates founded Microsoft decades ago, he did so with the belief that Microsoft could become a "software factory" that was "unconstrained by any single product or category." That idea is "no longer enough," Nadella said, adding that Microsoft needs to "reimagine" what its mission is. Microsoft is betting on AI, as it's investing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">$80 billion</a> into building out the technology and planning to bake AI into every product it makes, including Xbox.</p><p>"Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before," Nadella said in his pitch for AI.</p><p>Going forward, Nadella said Microsoft will focus on three main areas: security, quality, and "AI transformation." For AI, Nadella said Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack," including the infrastructure, app platform, apps, and AI "agents."</p><p>"Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star," Nadella said.</p><p>Regarding company culture, Nadella said team structures are changing, and things could get messy. "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere," he said.</p><p>The cuts at Xbox included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, game cancellations, and the closure of at least one studio. </a>It was later reported that developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King said they were <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set to be replaced by the tools they helped build.</a> For its part, Microsoft has said it expects the rise of AI to lead to job losses in the near term, but that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">the opportunities that AI presents outweigh the challenges.</a></p>

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical. Now it's hard not to imagine characters from Anderson's extensive filmography joining the fray-- picture Barry Egan from Punch-Drunk Love or Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights wielding a pickaxe and running alongside a humanoid fish and a banana with limbs.</p><p>In the meantime, Fortnite studio Epic Games is still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-plan-to-get-fortnite-back-on-ios-has-hit-a-snag-in-the-uk/1100-6533394/" data-ref-id="1100-6533394">get the title playable on iOS in the UK</a>. This comes after an extended legal battle that resulted in Fortnite's return to the US iOS App Store and the Epic Games Store in the EU iOS App Store.</p>

A multiplayer reveal is set for next week, where we'll get a sample of the game's new and returning modes, as well as how Battlefield's iconic classes will look in this new modern skirmish.</p><h2>How to watch the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will be livestreamed on Battlefield's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels. Following the showcase, which will feature developers from Battlefield Studios, viewers will be able to watch press and content creators play the game's new multiplayer suite live.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal start times</h2><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will kickoff at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET on July 31.</p><ul><li>11:30 AM PDT</li><li>2:30 PM EDT</li><li>7:30 PM BST</li><li>4:30 AM AET (August 1)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>EA and Battlefield Studios have claimed that Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will showcase various elements of the multiplayer suite. Specific mention is made of new and returning modes, which lends some credibility to reports of a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">battle royale mode</a> coming to Battlefield for the first time in the franchise's history.</p><p>Besides the aforementioned battle royale mode, it is incredibly likely that the team will be showing off both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-leak-shows-off-rush-mode-and-it-looks-fantastic/1100-6532821/" data-ref-id="1100-6532821">Rush</a> and Conquest, which are arguably Battlefield's signature game modes. The former sees teams planting bombs at pairs of objectives on a small section of a much larger map. The completion of these goals unlocks another set of the map and another pair of bomb sites, until eventually the entire map is unlocked or conversely, the attackers are held off within the time limit.</p><p>Conquest is Battlefield's flagship mode, often touting each respective games' biggest player count, and features warring teams fighting over a series of points of interest in a Domination-like competition. Holding the majority of the points begins to deplete the losing team's respawn counter, which also goes down with every kill.</p><p>Given the emphasis on New York City in the game's initial reveal, a safe assumption would be that the team will show off a multiplayer map taking place there. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-teases-all-out-war-ahead-of-full-reveal/1100-6533382/" data-ref-id="1100-6533382">teaser trailer</a> ahead of the reveal also made mention of Georgia (the country) and Gibraltar, which suggests these could also be maps in the latest game. Expect to see a lot of player destruction of the environments, as well as an emphasis on urban warfare in a deliberate callback to some of Battlefield's most iconic multiplayer arenas.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has also been very open about how it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">tweaking Battlefield's classes</a> following criticism of the last major release in the franchise, Battlefield 2042. That game released with specialists, which were reminiscent of heroes in titles like Overwatch 2, and their implementation proved to be controversial to stalwart Battlefield fans, who felt like the change diluted what they loved about the tactical squad-based gameplay of the series' past. Expect to hear a lot about these changes, as well as other alterations made to character and loadout customization.</p>
