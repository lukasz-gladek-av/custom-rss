                <p>The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> episode, Heresy, has arrived and with it plenty of big changes to classes. Tons of tweaks to the Arc subclass along with updates across the board have introduced some brand-new build possibilities. Here are three excellent builds for--one each for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter--that use some of the new features along with some different builds utilizing artifact perks. These include suggestions on which Exotic weapons, Fragments, Aspects, and Supers to combine for an effective and fun class setup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Arc Warlock</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953"></a><figcaption>An Arc Warlock build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The adjustments to the Arc subclass introduce a new mechanic known as <strong>Bolt Charge</strong>, which is a stacking elemental damage perk that unleashes a chain lightning burst when the stacks are full. Multiple sources of damage, including class abilities, will build up stacks of Bolt Charge. This build for Warlocks utilizes tons of Arc damage sources from both weapons and abilities to make the best use of it.</p><p dir="ltr">For armor, one of the best choices of Exotic is the <strong>Geomag Stabilizers</strong>. Extending the duration of your Chaos Reach Super will build up Bolt Charge stacks, and spreading Arc Damage around is crucial for making the most out of the new mechanicâ€“ these boots will help do just that. The patch released alongside the launch of Heresy changed Geomag Stabilizers to leverage Bolt Charge stacks: Sprinting while near maximum stacks will fill up the charges to unleash the attack from Bolt Charge.</p><p dir="ltr">The best weapon to pair with this build is the exotic Fusion Rifle <strong>Delicate Tomb</strong>. With its ability to generate Ionic Traces for Super energy and additionally adding more stacks of Bolt Charge. Delicate Tomb was also buffed for Episode Heresy with better chances to generate Ionic Traces, increased damage in PvE, and now the Tempest Cascade buff will last until the weapon is fired.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass to use for this build is <strong>Stormcaller</strong> with the <strong>Chaos Reach</strong> Super, the Ball Lightning melee attack, and Flashbang Grenade. For the Aspects choose <strong>Electrostatic Mind</strong> for increased creation of Ionic Traces when defeating Blinded or Jolted targets, and <strong>Ionic Sentry</strong> for the new autonomous turret. Defeating targets with Arc abilities or weapons will build up charges for an Ionic Sentry, which is then deployed by using a Grenade attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Class Fragments for this build should be <strong>Spark of Resistance</strong> for increased damage resistance while surrounded, <strong>Spark of Discharge</strong> which spawns extra Ionic Traces on Arc weapon final blows, S<strong>park of Beacons</strong> for blinding explosions on Heavy weapon final blows or special final blows, and <strong>Spark of Shock</strong> which debuffs targets hit by grenade attacks with Jolt.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Glaive Titan</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951"></a><figcaption>A Void Titan build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This setup is for melee-loving Titan players. Utilizing the recent buffs to Destabilizing Rounds, which detonates enemies hit by Void weapons after dealing damage with Void abilities, this build centers around lots of close-quarters fighting.</p><p dir="ltr">The main Exotic armor for Titans using this build should be <strong>Synthoceps</strong>. When a player is surrounded by enemies, they gain buffs to melee and Super damage as well as faster weapon reload speed and weapon handling. While using a Glaive, the melee buff is further applied using the weapon's close-range attack.</p><p dir="ltr">An excellent Exotic weapon to combine with this build is the class-exclusive Glaive <strong>Edge of Action</strong> from The Witch Queen expansion. Glaives combine both ranged and melee attacks and because of the emphasis on being Surrounded, further buffs from Synthoceps will make this weapon even stronger. As the Glaive builds up energy from hits with the ranged component, the special ability, Remote Shield, is triggered on full stacks. The next shot fired will put down a small dome shield wherever it is aimed at the ground. Hop inside the shield for extra defense and any enemy that comes inside the shield bubble is blinded and slowed.</p><p dir="ltr">For the subclass, Titans will need to be using <strong>Sentinel</strong> with the <strong>Twilight Arsenal</strong> Super. The Super can be exchanged for any other, as this build is not fully dependent on it, but Twilight Arsenal is the best all-rounder for the way this build functions. For class Aspects, the main one to choose is <strong>Controlled Demolition</strong>, which debuffs a target with Volatile when they're hit by a Void ability or another Volatile explosion. <strong>Bastion</strong> is an excellent second choice for the Void overshield on use of the Void Super.</p><p dir="ltr">The Class Fragments for this build are <strong>Echo of Exchange</strong>, which grants grenade energy after a melee kill; <strong>Echo of Undermining</strong>, which weakens targets hit by grenade attacks; <strong>Echo of Persistence</strong>, which enhances Void-based buffs such as Overshield; and <strong>Echo of Leeching</strong>, which starts healing players and nearby allies upon a melee kill.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Prismatic Hunter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958"></a><figcaption>A Prismatic Hunter build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This build leverages an underutilized and largely unknown synergy between two Exotic items for large area-of-effect damage combined with the new Bolt Charge mechanics. When used correctly, players can expect to clear rooms in a hurry and deal lots of damage to more hearty targets quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Exotics to use in this build, the two main choices are the <strong>Mothkeeper's Wraps</strong> gauntlets and the weapon <strong>Ex Diris</strong>. Mothkeeper's Wraps transforms the grenade ability into a bomb that releases two moths, one that applies a small Void overshield to you and a second that seeks a nearby target and explodes, causing the enemy to be blinded. Ex Diris is a special grenade launcher that shoots a large Arc projectile that detonates on impact. After a kill or rapid direct hits with it, its special perk spawns an additional moth that will seek nearby targets and explode, causing a blinding effect. Additionally, Ex Diris can shoot faster when dealing damage rapidly or the player takes sustained damage over time and survives.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass Hunters will want to use for this one is <strong>Prismatic</strong>. For the grenade slot, any grenade can apply here, but the best option is <strong>Strand Grapple</strong>. The melee attack for this build works best with <strong>Snare Bomb</strong>, which lets players throw a small smoke bomb at a target that deals damage over time and disorients them. Aspects for this build use <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> and <strong>Threaded Specter</strong>. Stylish Executioner will turn players invisible upon a kill with either a grenade or a melee ability, and the next melee attack while invisible will weaken a target. Threaded Specter spawns a Strand clone of the player when they use the Hunter's dodge ability that attracts enemies to it that detonates after a few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Facet of Protection</strong> will boost damage resistance while surrounded and the effect is even stronger while using the Transcendence special ability. <strong>Facet of Dawn</strong> will grant players Radiance upon a powered melee kill, which increases weapon damage from Solar element sources and causes a heal over time. <strong>Facet of Purpose</strong> will grant an elemental shield based on the chosen Super's element. <strong>Facet of Dominance</strong> causes Arc grenades to Jolt targets, which is applied via Ex Diris and the Mothkeeper's Wraps special bombs.</p>

                <p>Following the reveal of Battlefield Labs, a testing program for the next Battlefield game, EA has revealed a rough release date window for the full game (colloquially referred to as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>). It's due out during EA's 2026 fiscal year, meaning it will release between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026.</p><p>The news was shared as part of EA's latest earnings report, which came not long after the company warned of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">worse-than-expected performance</a> for the most recent quarter. No other news was shared about the new Battlefield game, although the release window comes on the heels of a flurry of Battlefield-related announcements.</p><p>We previously had no official word on when a new game might release, although a report had suggested it could come as soon as October 2025. Whenever it launches, it will be preceded by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/"

thousands of players, presumably in the hopes of leading to a more positive launch than EA saw with Battlefield 2042. Among other things, the game saw a controversial change to its traditional class system and an increase to the max player count.</p><p>The first of these tests will be starting in the "coming weeks" and cover a range of specific areas, like gameplay loops and map layouts. Learnings from the tests will then be shared online at a later time.

"A lot of that transitions easily back on the PC, whereas if you make a pure PC game where you use a mouse and keyboard to control, it's really difficult to port over. So it's been designed with a controller in mind from the get-go."</p><p dir="ltr">Many survival games usually get their start on PC, and once they become popular, may then release on consoles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valheim/" data-ref-id="5000-487741">Valheim</a> is a great example of a survival game making the jump. Having a game designed with a controller in mind from the start also opens up the possibility of the game being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">playable on Steam Deck</a> or other PC handhelds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Obviously, we're releasing on PC first, right?" Ryborg said. "So that's where we'll have a good setup, but the console UX-wise, I'm not super concerned. Obviously it's all the classic tech stuff, you know, where they're [consoles] a little more limited in certain hardware things. So it needs to perform well and other tech stuff. It shouldn't be overly complicated."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being made to work well with a controller from the start, the wait for the console version of Dune: Awakening could be a long one. The PC version doesn't have an exact release date but is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-release-window-and-extensive-gameplay-look/1100-6525990/" data-ref-id="1100-6525990">slated for "early 2025,"</a> according to Funcom. That means the console version will come sometime after, perhaps later in 2025 or even sometime next year.</p>

                <p>Sending collectors' items through the mail is supposed to be safe, but it seems that one former USPS employee commandeered some of these packages for himself. Shelby Dozier pleaded guilty to theft of mail by a postal service employee, a charge that stemmed from at least 10 incidents that allegedly occurred while he was employed as a sorting clerk at a USPS office in New Jersey.</p><p dir="ltr">Between September and December of 2022, Dozier allegedly swiped the contents of at least 10 packages that were mailed to an auction house in Clifton, New Jersey. Per <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/30/former-usps-worker-stole-sports-memorabilia/78051037007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, these packages included premium items like Michael Jordan and Mickey Mantle trading cards, several dozen graded sports cards and Pokemon cards, as well as signed jerseys, signed photos, and other such memorabilia.</p><p dir="ltr">Dozier was suspected by several of his fellow employees when they noticed opened and empty parcels in the men's locker room. Law enforcement used phone records and Dozier's own employment attendance records to substantiate their suspicions, and they eventually searched his iCloud account, where they found records of sellers buying the stolen memorabilia from Dozier. Dozier's plea agreement includes $108,692.92 in restitution to his victims; though he has not been sentenced yet, the charge carries a maximum potential prison sentence of five years.</p><p dir="ltr">Trading-card theft has become increasingly common over the past few years, ostensibly because public figures like Logan Paul have boosted the profile of expensive, rare cards, especially in the Pokemon space. Back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-and-magic-card-heist-thwarted-in-dramatic-and-unexpected-fashion/1100-6527206/">October of last year</a>, two men were arrested under suspicion of stealing Magic the Gathering and Pokemon cards totaling $150,000 in value from a game store, though a portion were later recovered.</p>
