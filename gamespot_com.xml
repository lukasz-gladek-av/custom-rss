Instead, it uses new eye-tracking technology and a lenticular lens to generate high-definition 3D images without the need for any eyewear. Samsung is currently working with partners like Nexon and Neowiz to showcase its abilities. If footage isn't designed for 3D, its AI video conversion tech can transform most 2D scenes into a 3D scene, ensuring you can use the monitor for a wide range of content.</p><p>Beyond 3D, the monitor offers all the other premium features you'd expect from a high-end device. This includes a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and 4K resolution. You'll also get AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync for tear-free gaming. And if you're a fan of ambient lighting, the monitor is equipped with Edge Lighting that illuminates the space around the monitor based on the on-screen action.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Odyssey OLED (G81SF)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Available in 27-inch and 32-inch formats, the Odyssey OLED (G81SF) is all about image quality. Samsung notes that the 27-inch model offers the highest pixel density (166ppi) among any of its 27-inch monitors, making it a brilliant choice for discerning gamers. The 4K resolution supports a blistering 240Hz refresh rate, VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 for vibrant colors, and a glare-free coating to limit refractions from nearby light sources.</p><p>A 0.03ms response time makes it ideal for gaming, as does support for both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync. The screen isn't the only good-looking part of the monitor, as its slim metal frame and various built-in lights should make it a premium companion for your gaming room.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">49-Inch Odyssey G91F</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>There are already many 49-inch gaming monitors on the market, but Samsung is looking to bring "curved ultrawide gaming" to a larger audience. Hopefully, this will be done by offering a more affordable price tag, but right now, it's unclear exactly what this massive monitor will cost.</p><p>It's well equipped, with the monitor offering a 1000R curve, 144Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time, plus support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Two of its most useful features might be Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture, allowing you to display two different devices on screen at once. They can even be resized based on your preferences.</p><p>Expect to learn more about pricing and release date details for all three monitors in the coming weeks.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go SteamOS Handheld Preorders Are Live At Best Buy</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-twilight-princess-11-book-manga-box-set-is-nearly-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6520959/">Zelda: Twilight Princess 11-Book Manga Box Set Is Nearly 50% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-is-finally-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime Is Finally Back In Stock With A Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/middle-earth-6-film-4k-blu-ray-collection-gets-huge-launch-discount/1100-6529053/">Middle-earth 6-Film 4K Blu-Ray Collection Gets Huge Launch Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-trek-lower-decks-complete-steelbook-box-set-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528696/">Star Trek: Lower Decks Steelbook Box Set Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-limited-edition-ps5-controller-preorders-restocked-at-major-retailers/1100-6529950/">The Last Of Us Limited-Edition PS5 Controller Preorders Restocked At Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic Hardcore characters who permanently died during recent DDoS attacks will be restored, Blizzard says, citing the disruption as "a cut above anything we've faced before."</p><p dir="ltr">The attacks happened multiple times over the weekend and affected a large number of players, but in particular seemed targeted at the WoW Classic Hardcore streamer guild <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-onlyfangs-twitch-roleplay-1235222436/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OnlyFangs</a>, a group that has made a name for itself on Twitch playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-hardcore-servers-will-combat-griefing-but-leave-the-rest-up-to-players/1100-6515547/" data-ref-id="1100-6515547">WoW Classic's high-stakes permadeath mode</a>. During a boss fight against Ebonroc in Blackwing Lair, many Onlyfangs players were disconnected as a result of the denial-of-service attack, resulting in a large number of guild members <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpartialAdventurousAsteriskPraiseIt-ENr-xvTV29UraV3Z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dying</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The guild leader, a player by the name Sodapoppin, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ji81ms/sodapoppin_declares_the_end_of_onlyfangs/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/blizzard-revives-hardcore-characters-affected-by-ddos-attacks/&amp;rdt=35392" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> what amounted to the end of the guild shortly after. He cited the targeted attacks as making the continuation of the guild difficult unless Blizzard decided to restore killed characters, something he said he believed was "highly unlikely."</p><p dir="ltr">But that is, in fact, what Blizzard is doing. In a post on the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-response-to-the-ddos-attacks/2082423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WoW Classic forums</a>, associate production director Clay Stone said Blizzard would resurrect characters that died as a result of the attack, which goes against the developer's broader stance on how it treats WoW's Hardcore realms.</p><p dir="ltr">"Unlike the many other ways characters can die in Hardcore, DDoS attacks are an intentionally malicious effort made by third-party bad actors, and we believe the severity and results of the DDoS attacks specifically warrant a different response," Stone said.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's overall stance on character deaths in WoW Classic Hardcore hasn't changed, Stone continued, stating that characters who die due to random lag spikes, bugs, or occasional server disconnects will not be restored. Stone said in the future, Blizzard may elect at its sole discretion to revive characters that die in a mass event it deems "inconsistent with the integrity of the game," including future DDoS attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrend.bsky.social/post/3ll6byzbyvs2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, WoW Classic senior game producer Josh Greenfield said it had been a "gut wrenching few days" and called the scale and scope of the DDoS attacks "a cut above anything we've faced before."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a tough call, but the only alternative is letting the losers behind these DDoS attacks win, and honestly, f*** that," Greenfield said.</p>
