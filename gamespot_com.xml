                <p>Season 17 of Rare's online pirate title Sea of Thieves was announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it'll add a mischievous new faction to the game's sandbox called The Smuggler's League. The upcoming season, titled Smugglers' Tide, begins in August and includes new Voyages and some of the most powerful explosives in the game.</p><p>Judging from the trailer, The Smuggler's League is all about, well, smuggling loot, salvaging treasure and other goodies from sunken ships or stealing them from other players. Some of the new loot showcased in the trailer includes crates filled with golden bottles and black gunpowder barrels, which will most certainly explode if mishandled, but players can weaponize their explosive capabilities.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalWScU3-dU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GalWScU3-dU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer showcases characters using harpoon guns to snag loot and employing stealth tactics to make off with explosive barrels. While the trailer doesn't go into detail about faction-specific rewards, expect to earn several exclusive cosmetics for completing Smuggler's Voyages and commendations.</p><p>The current season of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/" data-ref-id="1100-6531724" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/">one-of-a-kind Sea of Thieves</a>, titled Reapers Rule, began on May 22, adding new content for The Reaper's Bones faction. The season also added a new Voyage, the ability to summon NPC skeletons to assist your crew, and a portable cannon called the Cannon of Rage.</p><p>Rare is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/" data-ref-id="1100-6529543" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/">developing a title called Everwild</a>, but the game was a no-show at this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

                <p>Keeper, the newest game from acclaimed adventure-game developers Double Fine and veteran designer Lee Petty, was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. As the name implies, the game involves a moving lighthouse--though whether you're playing and the lighthouse or a being managing it (a "keeper") isn't quite clear. A green bird appears frequently alongside the lighthouse, seeming to aid and guide the lighthouse as it travels through a variety of colorful environments including gemstone-adorned caves, treacherous cliffsides, ancient ruins, and a desolate plain. The bird also seems to be important for solving puzzles, as the trailer demonstrates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAwVgTsFfk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also get a brief look at some very large beings that could either be mechanical monstrosities or organic giants. How the lighthouse will deal with these obstacles, or if they're even threats at all, remains unclear. Keeper will release on Xbox Series X and PC on October 17, 2025.</p>
