The remaster, coming next week, boasts updated lighting and reflections, upscaled textures, improved water effects and skyboxes, and upscaled cinematics.

One is that a player might go "all the way in" and dedicate lots of time and money. A second category of players might find the perceived time sink to be too enormous and simply play something else instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>FBC aims to be a game that people can pick up and play in short bursts, at a modest price point ($40). The game is also included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">PlayStation Plus</a> from day one, which in theory should help it reach a potentially larger audience.</p><p>"The game is made by middle-aged dads for middle-aged dads," Remedy's Anssi Hyytiäinen told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/with-fbc-firebreak-remedy-says-its-made-a-control-shooter-for-dads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "That was something that we talked about a lot. We wanted to make the game easy to pick up and throw yourself in there and have fun with your friends."</p><p>Kayatta, meanwhile, said FBC's session lengths were deliberately designed to be played in as little as five minutes. Even for a completionist, the game might take 30 or 40 hours to play as opposed to "thousands of hours."</p><p>"So we're not like Monster Hunter for sure. And that's been conscious decision also in that this we don't want it to be like almost predatory design practices of trying to suck all of your time out of your life," he said.</p><p>Kayatta told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-modern-games-says-remedy-director-of-fbc-firebreak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that FOMO design concepts have "infected a lot of modern games," and that Remedy intentionally tried to reduce FOMO with FBC.</p><p>On the subject of FOMO, former Call of Duty veteran developer Mark Rubin recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-cod-dev-laments-the-series-leaning-so-heavily-into-fomo/1100-6531275/" data-ref-id="1100-6531275">Activision is resorting to manipulation tactics</a>, including FOMO, to encourage people to play Call of Duty.</p><p>FBC releases on June 17 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
