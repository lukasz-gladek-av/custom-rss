                <p>Sega and Waze have partnered to bring Sonic the Hedgehog to the GPS app, and as part of it, Sonic's voice will give you driving directions to wherever you're headed.</p><p>Beginning today, October 15, Waze users can activate Sonic as a new voice navigation option, and they can choose from English and French. Users will hear Sonic tell you where to go "with his usual coolness and confidence to guide the way," Sega said in a news release. One thing he probably won't say is that you gotta go fast. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585657" data-ratio="0.55589586523737" data-width="653" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585657"></a><figcaption>Sonic comes to Waze.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Additionally, a variety of Sonic-themed icons are now available in the Waze app. One of them, "Speedster Lightning," shows your car as a vehicle from Sonic Racing: Crossworlds. Users can also choose the "Energetic" mood to transform the Waze app with "extra Sonic personality."</p><p>Sega said it's doing this partnership with Waze to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog. The developer said people can expect "even more exciting announcements" over the year to come before the 35th anniversary in 2026.</p><p>Sonic is not Waze's first gaming crossover, as the Google-owned GPS app <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/master-chief-will-give-you-gps-directions-in-new-halo-infinite-promo-with-waze/1100-6494707/" data-ref-id="1100-6494707">previously partnered with Microsoft to have Master Chief give you directions.</a> There was also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-waze-collab-lets-horde-warchief-thrall-guide-you-on-your-travels/1100-6526798/" data-ref-id="1100-6526798">World of Warcraft crossover, featuring Thrall giving you directions.</a></p>

However, the company later<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374"> backtracked and announced the game would stay at $70</a>. The game's $100 Premium edition did not go down in price. With The Outer Worlds 2 no longer retailing for $80, that makes Nintendo's Mario Kart World the only major new release from a big publisher going for $80 this year.</p>

                <p>Released in 2011, Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was a success at launch and continued to grow in popularity over the years. It's now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as the No. 8 best-selling game in history.</a> Why has the game had such enduring appeal? Lead designer Bruce Nesmith said on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FRVR Podcast</a> that the game's open-world design was done in a way that "nobody had ever done before" and that only "very few" games have tried to do since.</p><p>"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It's like, 'What the hell is going on here?'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><p>Nesmith, who has since left Bethesda, said he remembers when Bethesda boss Todd Howard--who directed Skyrim--would host in meetings in which he would tell staff about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">how wildly popular the game continued to be some 10 years after launch.</a></p><p>Nesmith went on to say that Bethesda accepted that Skyrim would have bugs and quirks, and fans did too. "You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond," he said.</p><p>Before this, Howard said of Skyrim's ongoing appeal and all the subsequent re-releases for new platforms: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">"If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it."</a> It's become something of a joke that Bethesda will release the game on any and all platforms, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-jokes-about-skyrim-on-amazon-alex/1100-6459648/" data-ref-id="1100-6459648">including Alexa devices. </a></p><p>Bethesda is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but it's likely still a long time off. The company is also developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5.</a></p>
