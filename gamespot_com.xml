                <p>Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.</p><p>Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended explanation</a> about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H1SNkcEU9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8H1SNkcEU9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.</p><p>Ubisoft has placed a great deal of importance on scouts in this game, as the recruits can help Naoe and Yasuke find places of importance in the game's world without having to transverse every step on their own. Scouts can also raid enemy strongholds one-at-a-time, and so subtly that their marks may not realize what's happening until it's too late. With the resources from scout raids, Naoe or Yasuke can customize their safe houses. Additionally, scouts can help the players cancel provisional alerts if either character has been caught breaking the law.</p><p>Viewpoints are also making a return in Shadows, with some modifications. Player characters can now spot and discover distant locations by getting on a high building and using the 360-degree observe function, which will mark special locations on your map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zp0v_S61cAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As before, viewpoints will open up fast-travel points as well. However, not every fast travel point is safe to go to. Some of them are in enemy-controlled land, and you'll have a major fight on your hands if the enemies discover that your characters have dropped by unannounced.</p><p>If players need a clearer idea about where they are going, the pathfinder feature can be used on horseback. It's not unlike the tools used in Grand Theft Auto games to keep your characters on the right track to their intended destination.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXycOtXBNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A recent rumor suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-assassins-creed-games-may-come-to-switch-2-report/1100-6528782/" data-ref-id="1100-6528782">Assassin's Creed Shadows will come to Switch 2</a>, but it remains unconfirmed for now. Assassin's Creed Shadows was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">also recently delayed again</a>. The new release date is March 20, and it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
