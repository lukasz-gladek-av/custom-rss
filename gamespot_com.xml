                <p>Last month, it was reported that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-digital-edition-reportedly-gets-surprise-downgrade-in-europe/1100-6534436/">PS5 was getting a surprise downgrade</a> in Europe, as the 1TB SSD was being shrunk to 825GB on the digital edition console. The CFI-2100 model has been confirmed for that region, and in addition to the smaller SSD, it also features several other changes designed to reduce its costs.</p><p>While this has resulted in a slightly lighter PS5 console that will presumably be cheaper to produce and ship, these savings will not be passed on to the consumer, as it will still retail for €500--roughly $586--when stock enters the market and replaces the current PS5 Digital console model.</p><p>YouTuber Austin Evans has unboxed this new model, revealing the changes inside the PS5 console. The smaller SSD now has 667.2GB of storage capacity when compared to the 848.0GB of usable space that was available with the 1TB model--a reduction of 27%. Several components are also lighter, and the black central casing now has a matte finish.</p><p>Crucially, power and performance remain the same when compared to older PS5 console models, but consumers will want to consider expanding their storage capacity by installing a secondary NVMe SSD.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrxVnRxLo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-0UrxVnRxLo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This year has been tough for gamers, as console hardware prices have continued to increase across the industry. In April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/">Sony increased the price for Digital and Standard Edition PS5 consoles</a> across Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and in August, the PS5 consoles increased by $50 in the US for all models. Sony said it was continuing to navigate a "challenging" economic environment, resulting in the console price increases.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has raised the price of its Xbox Series X|S consoles twice this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">The first price increase came in May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">another round of price hikes</a> was announced in late September. The company's entry-level 512GB Xbox Series S console now costs $400--up from its 2020 launch price of $300--and the 1TB Xbox Series X console now retails for $650, which is a substantial jump from its original November 2020 launch price of $500.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced another Xbox Game Pass price hike, with the Ultimate tier going up to $30/month. Microsoft is making this change just ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's release.</p><p>For now, however, you can still get a one-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription for $20 at Amazon.</p><p>Microsoft is making the price changes as part of a wider claim that it's giving people "more" than before to help justify the price hike. "We know not everyone wants the same thing in their Xbox experience, so we’re evolving Game Pass to offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players," Microsoft said.</p><h2><strong>New plan names and pricing</strong></h2><p>Beginning today, October 1, Microsoft is rolling out three "upgraded" Game Pass tiers, including Essential, Premium, and Ultimate. The Xbox Game Pass Core tier is being removed, with people on that plan automatically shifted to Essential. Additionally, the Standard tier is gone as well, with members shifted to the Premium plan. The Ultimate plan is staying the same, at least in terms of its name.</p><ul><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Essential</strong> -- $10/month</li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> -- $15/month</li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong> -- $30/month</li></ul><h2><strong>Game Pass Ultimate gets "biggest upgrade yet" with these perks</strong></h2><p>Game Pass Ultimate is seeing a 50% price increase from $20/month to $30/month, and Microsoft said the tier is getting the "biggest upgrade yet," but what does that actually mean?</p><p>For Game Pass Ultimate, subscribers are now getting "more day-one games than ever before," along with access to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/fortnite-crew-subscription?lang=en-US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Crew</a> and <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/ubisoftplus/classics?lang=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Classics</a>. Members also get "enhanced" Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality up to 1440p. Fortnite Crew, which costs $12/month by itself, comes to Game Pass Ultimate on November 18. Fortnite Crew gives members the latest Fortnite battle pass, along with 1,000 V-Bucks each month, in addition to other benefits. Ubisoft+ Classics, meanwhile, costs $16/month on its own and includes a variety of Ubisoft gams for PC, console, and the cloud.</p><p>Another perk added to Game Pass Ultimate is "best quality streaming and shortest wait times" for Xbox Cloud Gaming. Additionally, Xbox Cloud Gaming has now officially left "beta" and is now at 1.0.</p><p>There are also Rewards program perks for Game Pass Ultimate members who subscribe for the new, more expensive price. "With our upgraded Rewards program, players can get up to 30% value on select Game Pass games, with 4x points on purchases of games and add-ons, 10% back in points on select Game Pass library titles and add-ons, and up to 20% off select Game Pass games," Microsoft said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRcXlQs98n4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bRcXlQs98n4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

                <p>Ubisoft has announced Vantage Studios, which is a "creative house" at the company that will spearhead the development of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises.</p><p>This is the name of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">new subsidiary that Ubisoft and Tencent announced earlier this year</a>. It's being led by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, along with Christophe Derennes. Charlie Guillemot is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">aware of the nepotism concerns and said he just wants to get to work.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161" data-ratio="0.55928646379853" data-width="953" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161"></a><figcaption>The franchises that Vantage Studios is focusing on.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>"Vantage Studios will take on development and expansion of these brands, building on the foundation of Ubisoft's experience and expertise, sharing services and technical resources, all while giving developers more hands-on control over the games they are building," Ubisoft said.</p><p>The company added that Vantage Studios is Ubisoft's "first step" in the company's ongoing transformation efforts. There are also plans currently underway to make "additional creative houses" and a push to "group its brands and franchises under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise."</p><h2><strong>So, what does Vantage Studios do?</strong></h2><p>Vantage Studios, along with any future "creative houses" that may come, have the directive of being the teams to "facilitate stronger and deeper connections between developers and players."</p><p>"This streamlined approach allows for both a higher level of autonomy for developers and a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback, while still offering the benefit of Ubisoft's expertise, services, tools, and tech," the developer added.</p><p>Vantage Studios is comprised of teams working on the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises for its teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p><p>Finally, Ubisoft said people should "keep your eyes peeled for future announcements."</p><h2><strong>How Ubisoft got here</strong></h2><p>Ubisoft was facing financial hardships and undertook cost-cutting efforts that included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a> The company was accused by some of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">"horribly managed,"</a> and reports emerged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA (now itself being acquired)</a> and Microsoft were among those said to be interested in acquiring some or all of Ubisoft prior to Tencent coming in with its offer.</p><p>In March 2025, Ubisoft announced a new "dedicated subsidiary" that is focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, with Tencent providing more than $1 billion to acquire a stake. Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options."</p>
