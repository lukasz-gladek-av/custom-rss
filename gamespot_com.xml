                <p>Bella Ramsey, who stars in HBO's The Last of Us as Ellie, has a message for viewers who are upset about the show and the changes from the source material heading into Season 3: "You don't have to watch it."</p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pdBtYGyS44Tvv0Xy46HXn?si=_bMLHvokTTugDZwPztkSUg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=9ac8872088cd4e28" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Awardist podcast</a> (<a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1960918774498124195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Culture Crave</a>), Ramsey first reacted to the controversial second season, in which Kaitlyn Dever's Abby brutally murders Joel (Pedro Pascal). Ramsey said they tried to "steer clear" as much as possible from the discourse and controversy.</p><p>"There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn't affect the show, it doesn't affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they're very separate things to me. So no, I just don't really engage," Ramsey said.</p><p>In the lead-up to Season 3, Ramsey said people can simply play the game if they want that story.</p><p>"I would say, you don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don't have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it," Ramsey explained.</p><p>The Last of Us TV series takes notable departures from the source material, and that was always the plan. Showrunner Craig Mazin said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/" data-ref-id="1100-6515962">expecting "furor" from fans over Season 2</a>, and that is indeed how some fans reacted. Others enjoyed and embraced Season 2. "We don't operate to either make people happy on social media or avoid making them upset," Mazin said.</p><p>The Last of Us series veteran Neil Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">not involved with Season 3</a>, as he is instead focusing on his efforts at Naughty Dog and directing the upcoming new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-boss-reacts-to-neil-druckmann-leaving-and-reveals-season-3-release-window/1100-6533189/" data-ref-id="1100-6533189">will premiere in 2027</a>. What hasn't been decided yet is if Season 3 will be the show's last, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-boss-reacts-to-neil-druckmann-leaving-and-reveals-season-3-release-window/1100-6533189/" data-ref-id="1100-6533189">if there could be one more season.</a></p><p>As for the game series, Naughty Dog is reportedly working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

                <p>September 4 is quite the scary date for indie devs this year. You probably already know why, but here's the reason anyway: After a long wait, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/">finally arriving on that exact date</a>. It's easily going to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year, and because of that fact, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">number of indie games</a> have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/">opted for a delay</a> to avoid being drowned out by the Silksong-mania. One exception is a co-op racing party game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fling-to-the-finish/" data-ref-id="5000-494249">Fling to the Finish</a>, as the companies responsible have decided to release its console ports on the same day as Silksong.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Daedalic Entertainment and developer Splitside Games confirmed the game will be releasing on console September 4 in a press release, referencing Silksong in a tongue-in-cheek manner: "Arriving same day as THAT metroidvania." To be fair, as you can see in a trailer below, there's no real reason to think that Fling to the Finish is in any direct competition with Silksong.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVmKO10jaT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cVmKO10jaT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish is more in the vein of games like Human: Fall Flat, as it sees you playing as perfectly spherical, cartoonish characters that are tied together two at a time. You then have to maneuver through various obstacle courses as you try not to drag your friend down with you, all while racing other players. Apart from both games featuring platforming, their target audiences couldn't be more different, so there's no reason to think Silksong should affect Fling to the Finish's release on console.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also play Fling to the Finish in solo, online multiplayer, local split-screen, and both local and online co-op, and there's cross-play between platforms too. If you really want to start an argument with your friends, there's even a "share a controller" local co-op mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish launches on September 4, and you'll be able to play it on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. It's already available to play on PC.</p>
