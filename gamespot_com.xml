                <p>It's been nearly 20 years since Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a> came out, and while there's no word of a sequel, the next best thing may have dropped: a mod that introduces online multiplayer to the high school action sim.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>, a group of modders has finally revealed Bully Online. Led by YouTuber, developer, and "massive Bully fan," SWEGTA, the project has been a long time coming, but is inching ever closer to an early-access launch in December 2025 for those who <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support the team on Ko-Fi</a>. At the time of this writing, it appears the developers have received at least 76 Ko-Fis.</p><p>What is Bully Online, though? According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube video's description</a>, the mod "allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more." SWEGTA described it in greater detail in the nearly nine-minute video below, stating that it's a "mix between minigames, free-roaming, and role-playing." There's a "fully fleshed-out inventory system," letting you earn money in-game to spend on Bully goodies from items to housing to vehicles. It sounds like the online modes of other Rockstar games, such as GTA Online and RDR Online.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you do support the project on Ko-Fi for $8 (either as a one-time donation or a monthly subscription), you get additional perks alongside early access in December. This includes behind-the-scenes content (like developer commentary), a blue player nametag to denote your specialness, an in-game camera to save and share up to 10 photos, priority server queue to get in more quickly, and a Discord role and access to an exclusive text channel to yap with the development team behind the mod.</p><p>This is all well and good, and a welcome addition to a franchise beloved by many, but what about Bully 2? Well, you never say never, but you certainly say "wait a while," as, according to Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">a sequel never materialized due to bandwidth</a>.</p><p>"If you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houser told IGN at LA Comic Con in September 2025</a>. "With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p>

                <p>For the second year in a row, it's looking like an official Lego tabletop game is going to be one of the most popular board/card games during the holiday season. Last year it was <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monkey Palace</a></strong>, a fun strategy board game for up to four players. This year it's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brick Like This</a></strong>, a collaborative party game for up to eight players. Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game--not to be confused with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Party-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FCGVMVRD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Party</a>, the video game--is available now for only $20 at Amazon and other major retailers. </p><p>Brick Like This and Monkey Palace were designed by Dotted Games, a studio under the Asmodee umbrella dedicated to Lego board games. Based on the sustained success of Monkey Palace and how well Brick Like This appears to be performing out of gate, it seems likely we'll be talking about Dotted Games' third Lego board game this time next year.</p><div title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4827" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party\/dp\/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Brick Like This!

It's a fast-paced game that's dynamically designed to offer a different experience each time you play.</p><p>Players are split into teams of two in a race to see who can build miniature Lego models the fastest. One player builds the model based on instructions communicated by their partner. There are 92 shape cards and 48 total Lego pieces. Models have a minimum of five bricks and a maximum of eight bricks. You're awarded more points by opting for models with more pieces--though the instructor won't know what the model actually looks like until they flip the card over.</p><p>In addition to the regular shape cards, there are 20 challenge cards that introduce restrictions for builders and instructors, such as building the model with your eyes closed or with one hand and limiting the types of hints you can provide as the instructor.</p><p>When a team completes the model, they flip the hourglass, which starts a 30-second countdown to the end of the round. After six rounds, teams tally their scores and declare a winner. Each game takes around 15 minutes total.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4829" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.25 (was $42)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you haven't played the studio's debut game Monkey Palace, I'd highly recommend for family game nights if you like strategy and puzzle games. </p><p>Two to four players take turns building staircases and decorating the makeshift palace.
