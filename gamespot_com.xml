                <p>One of the biggest unknowns about Valve's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">how much the cute little six-inch cube will cost</a>. Plenty of people have offered their thoughts about where the price may land, and now Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has shared what he says Valve told him during a recent meeting.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAN Show</a>, Linus said he has no idea what the Steam Machine price will be, but in speaking to Valve, he came away thinking the system won't be priced similarly to a new console.</p><p>"When I said, 'I'm disappointed that it isn't going to follow a console pricing model where it's subsidized by the fact that the manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product,' they kind of asked what I meant by, well, 'What do you mean by console price?' And I said, 'Well, $500,'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-steam-machine-price-to-follow-a-console-pricing-model-of-500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN.</a></p><p>"Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn't great."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is far from confirmation of anything, and predictions about how much the Steam Machine may cost are all over the place. One expert believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">$400 is the sweet spot</a> for the entry model, while others believe it could be more than $1,000. Others believe it may be priced similarly to the PS5.</p><p>"Tariffs, surging memory / storage costs, supply chain volatility and an inability to subsidize to the same extent as traditional console manufacturers are all working against Valve at the moment," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1991311485323063443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said</a>. "That being said, the specs suggest Valve wanted this to be in line with PS5 pricing."</p><p>Before this, Linus said Valve told him they could not confirm a price for the Steam Machine due in part to "rapidly evolving market conditions."</p><p>"They did give me one hint, though. They said that while they expect it to be very competitively priced with a PC, that it will be priced like a PC. Rather than like a console with games subsidizing the upfront hardware price," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">he said.</a></p><p>Officially, Valve has only said its goal is for the Steam Machine to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">"affordable" and priced according to the value it offers</a>. This is pretty much what every company says about their products, so these comments don't tell us much of anything.</p><p>The Steam Machine launches in 2026, but preorders are not yet open and the exact launch timing has not been confirmed as of yet. For now, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">everything we know about the Steam Machine.</a></p>

                <p>Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene--the creator of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a>--has been working on his new open-world survival game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/" data-ref-id="5000-505925">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, for the better part of the last four years. Now, Prologue: Go Wayback! is officially entering early access today and giving players a chance to brave the elements from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdm77g5F2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLdm77g5F2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prologue unfolds from a first-person perspective and drops players into a landscape that changes in every playthrough thanks to procedurally-generated maps. Even the weather can dramatically change, which forces you to make choices about how you're going to survive. Thirst, hunger, and body temperature all need to be maintained long enough for you to reach a weather tower. There are always multiple approaches for that goal, and plenty of ways to die if you make the wrong move.</p><p>As part of the launch, PlayerUnknown Productions is introducing a handful of features. Players will be able to customize the weather, the temperature, and the time of day at the beginning of each playthrough, which can make the experience easier or harder.</p><p>The standard mode is called Go Wayback!, but there's an even more difficult option called Objective: Survive. In the latter, you'll have limited resources to fall back on. Users who just want to explore can try the Free Roam mode, which lets up on the survival aspect of the game. But you can still manage to die if you fall from a great height.</p><p>One of the most intriguing new features is the map editor, which will let you import an image into the in-game map and use it to create a customized world. Alternatively, you can design your own maps.</p><p>Future early-access updates are planned that will introduce more dynamic weather patterns, the ability to craft objects with the available materials, climbing gear, and items of clothing that can degrade or tear if players don't repair them.</p><p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is now available for $20 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-0261c6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios has made a key change to Battlefield 6's Conquest mode which the developer <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991482335527657827" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">says</a> should help matches run longer, but in a good way.</p><p>As of today, November 20, Conquest matches now have an increased number of tickets--up from 1,000 to 1,200. The developer said it arrived at this change after watching feedback generally, along with "win rates, balance, the impact of objective play, and more."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">1.1.2.0 update</a> made changes to help push players to play the objective, and this has been working out so far, with more come-from-behind victories, among other positive results. However, these changes also led to matches ending "sooner than intended," and to address this, Battlefield Studios is increasing the number of tickets. The developer said this should help with match length and retain the focus on playing the objective.</p><p>"We believe that focusing on objective play is deep in the DNA of Battlefield and now more than ever, playing the objective and working with your squad and being a cohesive team overall will secure your team the victory," the developer explained.</p><p>The 1.1.2.0 update for Battlefield 6 also made a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">major change to aim-assist</a>, reverting the system to be what it was during the open beta. In other news, Battlefield 6's newest season continues to unfold with the debut of a new map, Eastwood, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-california-resistance-event-pass-all-free-and-paid-rewards-to-unlock/2900-7264/" data-ref-id="2900-7264">many more microtransactions.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website</a> states that the game is the "best-selling shooter game of the year," but the company has not provided any sourcing or data to back this up.</p>
