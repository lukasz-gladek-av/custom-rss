                <p>The first major professional tennis tournament of the year, the Australian Open, is underway now in Melbourne. New for the 2025 event is an alternate broadcast that makes players look like something out of Wii Sports. The Australian Open organizers rolled out what they are calling "AO Animated" versions of tennis matches this year, featuring animated, video game-looking versions of the real players.</p><p>As you can see in the video game, from the Jacob Fearnley vs. Nick Kyrgios match, the animation is far from perfect--at times, the player's racket and the tennis ball vanish out of thin air. The audio doesn't sync up perfectly, either. But it's pretty solid, all things considered. You can watch more of these matches on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open YouTube page under the "Live" tab.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fla1j5t4-Ws" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fla1j5t4-Ws" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Broadcasts of this nature are becoming more and more popular these days. Before this, the NFL and Disney+ partnered to air a very <a href="https://www.nfl.com/schedules/simpsons-funday-football" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre-looking Simpsons-themed broadcast</a> of the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Dallas Cowboys game on December 9. This broadcast had the likes of Homer, Bart, Moe, Carl, Barney, and Lenny suiting up and making plays on the field.</p><p>Before that, the NHL and Disney teamed up for a video game-style broadcast of a professional hockey game, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-nhl-broadcast-will-look-like-a-video-game-tonight-and-a-chicken-will-drop-the-puck/1100-6512314/" data-ref-id="1100-6512314">characters from the show Big City Greens lacing up their skates.</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-playoff-game-is-on-nickelodeon-this-sunday-with-spongebob-graphics-and-slime/1100-6499505/" data-ref-id="1100-6499505">who could forget the NFL's slime game featuring SpongeBob</a>?</p>

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly announcing a new entry in a "legendary Japanese IP" during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Along with this new game, Microsoft will also show off Doom: The Dark Ages, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and South of Midnight.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, this IP has decades of history and "should make a lot of fans happy."

Ninja Gaiden is one of the first franchises to come to mind. While it's not exclusive to Xbox platforms, entries like Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden 2 were.</p><p>However, The Game Kitchen and Koei Tecmo recently revealed the 2D side-scrolling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ninja-gaiden-game-on-the-way-from-blasphemous-devs/1100-6528432/" data-ref-id="1100-6528432">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, so a new fully-fledged 3D entry may not be likely.</p><p>Another possibility could be Resident Evil 9, as Capcom already confirmed that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-confirms-new-resident-evil-game-is-in-development-with-resident-evil-7-director/1100-6524638/" data-ref-id="1100-6524638">new entry is in the works with Resident Evil 7's director.</a> A new Tales games could be announced, as the franchise enters its 30th anniversary this year.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-6s-main-color-might-have-leaked/1100-6522502/" data-ref-id="1100-6522502">Persona 6 announcement</a> could be possible too, as Atlus has been relative quietly about its 2025 plans after having an impressive 2024 release slate with Persona 3 Reload, Unicorn Overlord, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/" data-ref-id="1100-6528323">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><p>In other Japanese Xbox news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> is reportedly set to release on Xbox sometime this year.</p>

                <p>Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 launches later this week and developer Grinding Gear has now previewed what to expect from it.. According to game director Jonathan Rogers, this patch primarily addresses issues developer Grinding Gear can address "relatively quickly," such as endgame maps and enemy balance.</p><p>You can see some of the details in a new video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile YouTube</a> channel. Endgame mapping (i.e. the autogeneration of levels) have received a balance overhaul, altering the number of chests, number of monsters, and lots of other variables. Four new "Tower" maps have been added, and the first Tower map, Lost Towers, has been redesigned to be "less boring." More endgame maps will include bosses, correcting a glitch that causes fewer bosses to spawn than intended.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNJSDxwC9bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pinnacle content has gotten some tweaks too. You'll be able to see citadels from further away in the fog of war making them easier to find. You'll also get up to six respawns for the pinnacle boss The Arbiter of Ash. The respawns can only be activated by the player who put in the keys at the Burning Monolith and they affect every player in your party at once. Respawns will be added to other Pinnacle content soon.</p><p>In other changes, lower-level unique items have gotten buffs to make them more fun to use. The patch makes effects more visible, both by removing clutter from some maps and by redesigning existing effects. Many monsters and bosses have gotten significant balance changes, such as some attacks not being triggerable when the enemy is off-screen.</p><p>Rogers noted that if a specific issue isn't discussed in this patch that does not mean that Grinding Gear is not aware of it or that it will not get addressed. You can look for the full patch notes when the patch launches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 will eventually be free-to-play,</a> but if you want to get early access, you'll have to shell out some cash.

                <p>We've known since the beginning of Chapter 6 Season 1 that we'd be getting a Godzilla skin with the battle pass in January. But it looks like this collaboration is going to be a lot bigger than you might have expected. Like, a <em>lot</em> bigger--judging by the short teaser Epic Games just dropped, there will be a skyscraper-sized Godzilla roaming the battle royale island starting this week.</p><p>It's not the most shocking news, since a Godzilla-sized Godzilla is a fairly logical thing to expect from a game that's had <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuY_X5ALrak?si=a7C69amDs0FzmKA3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">kaiju-sized monsters and mechs on the island in the past</a>, but it's cool to see the confirmation even so.</p><p>It's pretty clear, however, that there's still plenty more to this collab than we know about right now. For one thing, this collab is with Legendary Pictures for its Monsterverse franchise and last year's Godzilla x Kong--it would be pretty reasonable to expect both a King Kong skin in the item shop and a large King Kong boss on the battle royale island to battle Godzilla. And there are plenty of other potential kaiju from that franchise that could get skins, like Mechagodzilla and the Scar King.</p><p>The Godzilla skin is included with the Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass starting Jan. 17, though it will require a little bit of grinding to unlock. But, unlike in past seasons, you won't need to do any specific quests. Instead, Godzilla will be unlocked by earning XP in any experience--no need to play battle royale at all if you don't want to.</p><p>The timing of Godzilla's arrival is amusing, since this week is also bringing us the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku-themed Fortnite Festival Season 7</a>. Miku famously fought Godzilla in <a href="https://youtu.be/wPayU7s-G5Q?si=XZk4D637ia5xbAgH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a video from one of the Project DIVA rhythm games</a>, and so this is a bit of a serendipitous pairing.</p>

Earlier this month, Genki inadvertently became a part of that story when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">the company showed off a Switch 2 mockup</a> at CES.

He also related that someone at Genki told him that the company brushed off the lawyers because there was no non-disclosure agreement signed with Nintendo.</p><p>"I talked to the guy from Genki just behind me, he told me that Nintendo had stopped by with lawyers--they had nothing to be reprimanded for because they had never signed a paper with Nintendo--no confidentiality agreement, no NDA," said Tellouck.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">subsequently issued its own statement</a> which said, "The gaming hardware that Genki claims to be Nintendo hardware at CES is not official and was not provided to the company by Nintendo." While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a Genki representative expressed surprise at the story and shared the company's belief that what was shown had already been leaked beforehand.</p><p>The stakes for Nintendo are extremely high, as one analyst believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">that Switch 2 can sell 4.3 million consoles</a> in the US alone this year. Another report suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">Nintendo may unveil Switch 2 as soon as this week</a> for a possible summer launch. But until it actually happens, the rumors will continue to fly.</p>

new battle pass to level up. Activision hasn't revealed the details of the pass, but that information will likely be released closer to launch.</p><p dir="ltr">If Season 2 follows past Call of Duty seasons, the update will likely include new maps, modes, seasonal challenges, and more DLC weapons to unlock. Season 1 Reloaded is wrapping up with the ongoing Squid Game event, and it's possible that Season 2 will also have limited-time events and IP crossovers.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Anti_cheat_updates">Anti-cheat updates</h2><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ranked Play modes for multiplayer and Warzone are infested with cheaters, and Activision has acknowledged that there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-devs-say-ricochet-anti-cheating-measures-did-not-hit-the-mark/1100-6528554/">some problems with Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat system</a>. The publisher also revealed that there are major upgrades to Ricochet that will be launching with Season 2 and 3, so hopefully those updates will finally oust the hackers in both games.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><p dir="ltr">While we don't have any specific announcements for multiplayer, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes-revert-some-of-last-weeks-changes/1100-6528739/">January 9 patch notes</a> for Black Ops 6 revealed a few anticipated fixes scheduled for Season 2 of Zombies. This includes an update to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic on the Terminus map again, which will revert the change made that patched this method in the January 3 update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 2 update should also provide a proper fix for the frustrating Vermin double-attack bug, which was previously listed as being fixed in recent patch notes, but the problem persisted for players. The developer commented on the issue by saying, "Sometimes bugs appear fixed in testing but turn out to still be an issue in the live game after the patch goes out. This sucks for everyone involved, and it can lead to inaccurate patch notes, which we never want."</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies received the Citadelle des Morts map in Season 1, and while it's uncertain if another new map will arrive for Season 2, we do have story teasers that point to the next map being an excavation site in France. The setting and location sound very similar to the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2, which took place at Excavation Site 64 in Northern France.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Details for this next season of battle royale haven't been revealed yet, but in addition to anti-cheat improvements, Season 2 will likely include new modes, events, and game improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Verdansk map is set to return in the springtime, which an insider has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/verdansk-could-return-to-call-of-duty-warzone-in-season-3/1100-6528765/">leaked to potentially be the Season 3 update</a> for Warzone.</p>

                <p>Developer FuturLab has announced that it is ending support for PowerWash Simulator VR due to its dwindling financial viability. However, the studio has seemingly avoided layoffs since the VR team has been moved to other projects.</p><p>"We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects," CEO Kristy Rigden explained in a statement.</p><p>She said that she prioritized job security for her team, so she filled those other roles and projects with members from the VR team.</p><p>Rigden also explained that while general VR support is currently winding down, that doesn't mean that the FuturLab won't support the platform in the future. The studio clarified that the VR game and currently released DLC are still purchasable and playable, but it will not receive any future updates.</p><p>The VR space has seen some challenges over the past few years.

                <p dir="ltr">Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 is in the books, with this year's version of the annual speedrunning event raising over $2.5 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Among the most memorable runs of the weekend--and perhaps one of the most memorable runs in GDQ history--came right before the end, when a player ran through Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast while a live band played the soundtrack behind him.</p><p dir="ltr">Runner "chuckles825" completed the Crazy Box mode--a series of individual skill-based trials--while his accompanying band Limiter Cut played the music that the game would normally be playing. This includes the drum-centric menu track, which drummer "The Sound Defense" recreated with every trip back to the Crazy Box menu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G4AomNJHzHk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Crazy Taxi features licensed music from The Offspring, which created a legal snafu for the Games Done Quick foundations thanks to copyright laws in the US--namely the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1999. The use of a live band to play the music instead is allowed by the DMCA, and thus the run came to fruition.</p><p dir="ltr">The four-piece band Limiter Cut featured "Metallama" on lead vocals, "2dos" on guitar and backup vocals, "SquidDilla" on bass, and the aforementioned "The Sound Defense" on drums. The run was completed in just under 20 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">This live band run was not the only musical run during Awesome Games Done Quick 2025. The week-long event also saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaCvZd7iOkM">Elden Ring played with a saxophone</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaWJ-40hFY">New Super Mario Bros. Wii run</a> where the player used his feet and head to control Mario--while also playing the soundtrack on a piano.</p><p dir="ltr">Replays for every speedrun shown during Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 can be found on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamesdonequick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Games Done Quick YouTube</a> page.</p>
