                <p>In a shocking <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Amazon MGM Studios has announced that it is taking over creative control of the James Bond series as part of a deal with series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. What does this mean for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-talks-about-new-james-bond-007-game-and-its-completely-original-story/1100-6489783/" data-ref-id="1100-6489783">Hitman developer IO's new James Bond game</a>, or any other future Bond projects? We don't know as of yet, but given just how long Broccoli and Wilson have led the franchise, changes could be afoot.</p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy.Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>In a statement, Amazon said Broccoli and Wilson have created a new joint venture where the James Bond IP rights will live, and they will continue to co-own the James Bond series. However, Amazon MGM Studios will "gain creative control of the James Bond franchise" once it closes the deal. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world," Amazon MGM Studios boss Mike Hopkins said.</p><p><span>IO's new James Bond game tells an origin story for the character, and that's never been done before. When the game was </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-007-game-in-the-works-at-io-interactive/1100-6484609/" data-ref-id="1100-6484609">announced in 2020</a><span>, IO said it was working collaboratively with the James Bond rights-holders on the project, and it subsequently came to light that IO intended for the game to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a><span> What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</span></p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," said Abrak. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slAhuh21ii8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/slAhuh21ii8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447114" data-ratio="0.55920484010372" data-width="1157" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447114"></a><figcaption>Amazon MGM Studios will have creative control of the 007 series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447114-screenshot2025-02-20at9.57.21am.png"></figure><p>Wilson said he plans to "focus on art and charitable projects," while Broccoli said she will focus on "my other projects."</p><p>Amazon bought MGM in 2002, and since then, it has owned the distibrution rights to the James Bond movies. There hasn't been a new James Bond movie since then, however, with 2021's No Time To Die being the most recent entry in the series.</p><p>Given this big shakeup, no one should expect the next James Bond movie anytime soon. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/amazon-mgm-studios-joint-venture-michael-g-wilson-barbara-broccoli-james-bond-1236295821/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported</a> that "no decisions have been made on the future Bond films including who will star, direct or write the next film."</p><p>Amazon MGM Studios taking over full creative control of the series could pave the way for a decision about the franchise's future to be made more easily. With Broccoli and Wilson no longer getting to decide the future of the series, many are wondering (and worrying) how this could all shake out.</p>

<section><p>Comfort, function, and convenience come together to produce a phenomenal option for Xbox and PC players if you don't mind the wire</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In order to be successful, a controller needs three things: comfort, function, and convenience. There's a reason why the Duke--the notoriously large controller that accompanied the original Xbox in 2001--was eventually replaced with a smaller design, durable as it was. The Duke was heavy and huge, with buttons spread out a little too far across the interface.</p><p dir="ltr">Scuf's newest controller, the Valor Pro Wired Controller for Xbox and PC, nails all three of these elements. Its light weight and smooth front faceplate makes it easy to carry and hold without irritation. The design of the bumpers and triggers on the top of the controller make it very simple to alternate between, while the four rear paddles offer extra control in tight situations. A few other additional features--like built-in audio controls--add additional convenience. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the Valor Pro is a great choice for Xbox and PC players alike, provided you can live with a wire attached to whatever you're playing on.</p><p dir="ltr">Right out of the box, the Valor Pro felt great in my hands, which are larger than most. The placement of the buttons and sticks seem to slot right into the positions my hands want them to be. It's surprisingly light in the hands too, to the point where it feels like a toy rather than a pro controller. That's not to say it feels cheap, though, as the sticks, buttons, and d-pad feel strong to the touch. The smooth faceplate creates a tight grip, and the nonslip grips work as advertised, no matter how sweaty the palms get--and I, a person with pretty sweaty hands, would know.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks on the Valor Pro are especially comfortable thanks to a ridged fabric-like border on the outside rim. There's no hard edge to irritate the thumb; instead, that fabric serves as a nice cushion when I'm blasting people in Fortnite or Call of Duty. The sticks should last a while too, as the Valor Pro contains Hall Effect anti-drift measures to keep them precise longer. There was no drift to speak of during this review--which, if there were, would be a huge issue for a brand-new controller--and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. Meanwhile, the d-pad's contoured shape fits the thumb nicely, and where other controller d-pads sometimes feel flimsy, this one has some weight to it with every touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The four back paddles on the controller are the most impressive thing on it, as each one avoids a common pitfall I've experienced with back buttons for some time: They resist accidental button presses. I've routinely pressed a button on the back of a controller at inopportune times, usually in quiet moments where stealth is key, and it immediately turns my strategy into mush. These paddles feel more like front face buttons than any I've used before, and that feeling has resulted in zero accidental activations during this review period.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valor Pro also offers controller profiles, where you can alternate between three different button designations for the back buttons. One is specific for shooters, and puts the change-weapon and reload buttons in the back; another is for sports games and assigns the A and B buttons back there, which helps with, for example, easy shooting and passing in NBA 2K. The third profile is for racing games, turning each back button into a different direction, and while I wasn't quite as enamored with that profile, the experience wasn't so bad that it killed the convenience of the other two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If none of those profiles fit for you, the Valor Pro’s custom remapping feature lets you set each profile to the buttons you use the most in the games you play the most. Remapping is simple; each profile is set to a different color, and if you hold in the profile button on the back until the colored LED blinks, you can then assign paddles to buttons however you like. Controller customization is increasingly becoming the standard, and the Valor Pro's version gets the job done.</p><p dir="ltr">If you plug a headset into your Valor Pro, you’ll have extra control over the audio thanks to the controller’s built-in volume knobs. The left knob on the bottom of the controller handles in-game audio, while the knob to its right focuses on chat volume, and both can be pressed down to mute the corresponding audio. Having these controls onboard the controller is super convenient, not to mention the knobs are, like the rest of the buttons on the Valor Pro, placed in a comfortable spot for your fingers to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its execution, the Valor Pro doesn't provide much in the way of <em>new</em> features. At $99, it sits in the "budget pro" controller tier with options like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> and Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot--or, at about two-thirds the price, the 8BitDo Ultimate. Those offer similar features to what the Valor Pro is doing here. Still, Scuf has done a great job designing this controller to feel like the top of the line rather than the less expensive option.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the matter of that pesky wire. Wired controllers are fine if your gaming setup allows for it, but wireless controllers are also popular for a reason--and something like the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Razer Wolverine V3 Pro or Xbox Elite 2 offers those options on a wireless controller for a similar price. It's true that latency is reduced with a wired controller, and Scuf's focus on precision calls for a low-latency solution, which something like a wire provides.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, people with close-quarters gaming setups won't be worried about this, but if your Xbox is across the room from your couch, the Valor Pro being shackled to the system likely won't work for you--even with the 10-foot USB-C cord included with the controller; a wireless controller works better than a potential tripping hazard.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I am very pleased with the Scuf Valor Pro. It's one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever used, with buttons placed so naturally that it's as if the controller was made for my hands specifically. The back paddles are fully customizable and resistant to frantic accidental pushes, the smooth grip keeps the controller in my hand no matter how wild a gameplay session gets, and the built-in audio controls give me easy access to both game sound and chat audio. A wireless version would have been great, but even with the wire, the Scuf Valor Pro is a fantastic option for your next Xbox or PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Valor Pro Wired Controller is available now for $99 at select retailers and at scufgaming.com.</p>

                <p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">WWE 2K25</a> features a Showcase mode that will let fans relive the past by taking part in several legendary matches. Essentially an interactive documentary--and hosted by "The Wise Man" Paul Heyman this year--2K Showcase: The Bloodline Dynasty will also allow players to alter the outcomes of these matches.</p><p>The trip down wrestling memory lane features a selection of classic bouts, including Yokozuna's infamous battle against Hulk Hogan at the 1993 King of the Ring, the brutal No Holds Barred match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rikishi, and the Royal Rumble 2022 showdown between Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.</p><p>Each match fits into one of three categories--Relive History, Change History, and Create History--and in total, 15 of them have been revealed so far. Here's the full list:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz8zsUmIBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tnz8zsUmIBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>Relive History</h3><ul><li>Yokozuna (with Mr. Fuji) vs. Hulk Hogan -- King of the Ring 1993</li><li>Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley -- RAW February 13, 1997</li><li>Nia Jax vs. Lyra Valkyria -- Queen of the Ring 2024</li><li>The Usos vs. The New Day (with Big E) -- Hell in a Cell 2017</li><li>Solo Sikoa vs. Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) -- NXT September 13, 2022</li></ul><h3>Change History</h3><ul><li>The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) vs. The Steiner Brothers -- WrestleMania IX</li><li>Rikishi vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin -- No Mercy 2000</li><li>Umaga (with Armando Estrada) vs. John Cena -- New Year's Revolution 2007</li><li>Tamina vs. Natalya vs. Carmella vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch -- Money in the Bank 2017</li><li>Naomi vs. Bayley -- Super ShowDown 2020</li><li>Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins -- Royal Rumble 2022</li></ul><h3>Create History</h3><ul><li>High Chief Peter Miavia vs. George "The Animal" Steele</li><li>The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) vs. The Dudley Boyz</li><li>The OG Bloodline vs. New Bloodline in WarGames</li><li>The Islanders (Haku and Tama) vs. The Street Profits</li></ul><p>Showcase Mode is typically one of the biggest highlights of a WWE 2K game, but this year's version of the mode is a big departure from previous instances, as it focuses on the Anoa'i family instead of a single superstar. The last couple of years in WWE programming have seen Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and several other members of that extended wrestling dynasty rise to prominence, while other WWE legends like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the late Umaga, and the Wild Samoans have all been praised for their contributions to the sports entertainment industry.</p><p>Beyond the Showcase mode, you can also hop on a boat and head to The Island--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-shows-off-its-new-open-world-island-mode-for-the-first-time/1100-6529460/">a new social space</a> that looks like it was heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City--take part in custom exhibition matches, and chart your own rise to the top as part of the MyRise mode. WWE 2K25 will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4 on March 14, but if you purchase the Deadman Edition or The Bloodline Edition, you'll get into the game a week early on March 7.</p><p>"With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-like-cody-rhodes-explores-what-comes-after-you-finish-the-story/1100-6529209/">WWE 2K25 preview</a>. "There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year."</p>

                <p>Near the end of last year, CD Projekt Red shifted its focus away from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> updates and bug fixes and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">put The Witcher 4 into full production</a>. But that doesn't mean the developer isn't starting work on the next game in the Cyberpunk 2077 franchise. In a new job listing, CD Projekt Red put out the word that it's looking to create even more impressive background NPCs in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-aiming-for-the-most-realistic-crowds-in-any-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/744000043324048-lead-encounter-designer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is looking for a lead encounter designer</a> for Project Orion, which is the codename for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. The listing notably states that selected candidates will be collaborating with the design team "to create the most realistic and reactive crowd system in any game to date." The position will also be responsible for designing "memorable combat encounters" and crafting "divergent experiences that cater to all available play styles."</p><p>Despite getting off to a rocky start after Cyberpunk 2077's launch in 2020, CD Projekt Red addressed most of the major issues within the game. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116">Phantom Liberty DLC expansion</a> was also highly praised for adding more life to Night City's inhabitants and surroundings. If the development team is going even further with NPC interaction in the sequel, it should be interesting to see if crowd encounters will affect the shape and flow of the story. A "realistic and reactive crowd" wouldn't just ignore or simply run away from players when things get violent. It also stands to reason that crowds could potentially interact with player-characters in more immersive ways.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't disclosed a timetable for Cyberpunk 2077's sequel yet, and the game could be several years away while The Witcher 4 is in development. However, The Witcher 4 director Sebastian Kalemba recently shared his belief that the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/" data-ref-id="1100-6528468">has learned from its mistakes with Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and won't be repeating them in the future. The developer's commitment to fixing Cyberpunk 2077's issues resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-after-its-disastrous-launch-cyberpunk-2077-has-a-great-steam-user-score/1100-6529009/" data-ref-id="1100-6529009">the game peaking at a 95% rating on Steam</a> four years after its release.</p>
