                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA authorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">a voice actors strike</a> against the major video game publishers, largely over the issue of AI protections. Nearly 300 days later, that's still the final point of contention between both sides. Now, the publishers have released what they characterize as the "best and last" offer for actors. And the actors have fired back with their counteroffer, all in the court of public opinion.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-actors-strike-saga-aftra-final-offer-1236387081/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the latest contract proposals between the studios and the actors have found common ground on most of the terms for a new deal. That includes 24% wage increases over the life of the contract. But the two sides' lack of agreement over generative AI continues to prolong the strike.</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game publishers, told Variety that, "We are hopeful the union will not choose to walk away when we are so close to a deal."</p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA noted that the video game publishers presented their latest offer on April 30, and the actors responded with a counter-proposal on May 2. According to the actors, the publishers didn't respond to that before making the negotiation terms public. SAG-AFTRA subsequently released its proposal online as well.</p><p>"SAG-AFTRA condemns the video game companies' attempt to sow confusion in the community by releasing misleading rhetoric about our ongoing negotiations," said the union through a spokesperson. "The statement suggesting that the union would 'walk away' from negotiations on this contract is absurd and the opposite of the truth. It is the employers who have threatened--through backchannel representatives--to move work to foreign countries and recast performers, in an unsuccessful effort to intimidate our negotiating committee and membership to capitulate to their demands."</p><p>Voice actors from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">Spider-Man, Resident Evil</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">Mass Effect</a> have previously spoken out about why the performers need protections from AI that could potentially recreate their voices without compensating the performers. Until that issue is resolved, it appears the strike will continue.</p>

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> trailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">finally here</a>, but what song is playing in it? Whereas the first trailer from December 2023 used Tom Petty's "Love Is A Long Road," this one features the song "Hot Together" by The Pointer Sisters. The song was written by Sharon Robinson and originally released in 1986.</p><p>Similarly to how the lyrics to "Love Is A Long Road" seemingly bore a connection to the story of GTA 6, that may also be the case for "Hot Together." The song is about a couple and their intense, passionate physical and emotional love. The tune tells the story of lovers who could be "hot together."</p><p>"We both know that it could feel good, so good / You led me through the crowded room / And out into the night / You kissed me like you did before / In the quiet of the moonlight," is one of the verses from the song.</p><p>The GTA 6 trailer, meanwhile, shows main characters Jason and Lucia reconnecting after Lucia's stint in prison. There are some steamy scenes in the trailer, too, and it's clear the two are lovers with a complicated connection given their penchant for crime.</p><p>Many have already remarked that GTA 6's story appears to be similar in nature to the story of Bonnie and Clyde, two American outlaws and lovers known for robbing banks and killing people together.</p><p>"Love Is A Long Road" saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-helps-tom-petty-song-surge-37000-on-spotify/1100-6519729/" data-ref-id="1100-6519729">huge boost to its streaming numbers</a> after it was included in GTA 6's first trailer, and it's expected that something similar could happen with "Hot Together."</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That's a while to wait, so in the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">more than 150 new GTA 6 images </a>in the gallery below. Beyond Jason and Lucia, GTA 6's story features a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">big cast of supporting characters</a>. And in terms of places you'll visit, GTA 6 takes players to Vice City itself, along with the surrounding areas, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/" data-ref-id="2900-6538">a park filled with wildlife.</a></p>

Think of it in a similar way to Diablo's world tiers.

This new location will be introduced with The Edge of Fate and, unlike its real-world counterpart, will exist within the solar system, right on the edge of it. Bungie didn't note whether the location difficulty customization will extend to its existing locations, or just be rolled out across new expansions.</p><p>We don't have long to wait to find out, since Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, as well as the names of the next three expansions in the Destiny 2 roadmap.</p>

It's similar to the spell that Delve NPC companion Brann Bronzebeard occasionally busts out when players are injured. The spell's healing properties, Wowhead notes, are actually stronger than the best cooking profession foods available, and it can also be used inside dungeons and raids.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's a nice little addition that in many ways feels overdue. Having to buy food from a vendor or eating just to regain lost health is definitely a core part of early WoW but hasn't been especially relevant as a mechanic for many, many years at this point. That's particularly true for characters with mana who have healing spells. Since running out of mana is almost unheard of in modern WoW unless you are in a lengthy PvP battle or extended raid encounter, classes with access to a heal can easily use that to restore their health fast instead of taking the time to eat.</p><p dir="ltr">Just because Blizzard is giving every player an easy way to heal up after encounters doesn't mean cooking or buying consumables from vendors will be obsolete. Recuperate, notably, does not restore mana. It also doesn't provide any stat-boosting buffs--the primary reason players sit down and eat a snack before a fight. That makes the game's cooking profession still relevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Recuperate is just one of many interesting additions coming as part of the game's next patch, titled Legacy of Arathor. It's also introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-11-1-7-will-add-a-new-story-focused-way-to-level-characters/1100-6531276/" data-ref-id="1100-6531276">new story-focused way to level characters</a> called Lorewalking and adding a rotation assist tool that can even go so far to turn a class' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">damage rotation spells into a single button</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 doesn't yet have a release date, but Blizzard in the meantime continues to share more details about how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">MMORPG's upcoming housing system will work</a>.
