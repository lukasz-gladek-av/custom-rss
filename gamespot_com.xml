                <p>The Fortnite collabs look like they could be off to a strong start next year, with leaks suggesting that a Bleach crossover is coming. According to the leaks, it's set to launch in early 2026 during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-all-weapons-and-loot/2900-7294/" data-ref-id="2900-7294">Chapter 7 Season 1</a>. Since the season is set to end on March 4, the most likely release window is January or February.</p><p>First spotted by noted dataminer SamLeakss, the collab could feature not just a character skin but also Ichigo's theme, "Number One." So the skin seems likely to be Ichigo himself.</p><p>Fortnite has been packed with collaborations lately, incorporating characters and icons from various worlds. In the past year alone, players have seen crossovers with horror legend Ghost Face, the viral Skibidi Toilet meme, Metal Gear Solid's Snake, and even recent pop-culture giants like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-x-fortnite-adds-skins-gameplay-items-and-their-own-demon-hunting-mode/1100-6535150/" data-ref-id="1100-6535150">KPop Demon Hunters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/fortnite-x-squid-game-official-island-escape-trailer/2300-6466244/" data-ref-id="2300-6466244">Squid Game</a>.</p><p>Anime crossovers have been especially popular with players. Fortnite has already teamed up with major series such as Naruto, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dragon-ball-super-crossover-all-skins-weapons-and-more/1100-6506500/" data-ref-id="1100-6506500">Dragon Ball</a>, Attack on Titan, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-jujutsu-kaisen-crossover-adds-new-skins-and-tons-of-free-cosmetics/1100-6516642/" data-ref-id="1100-6516642">Jujutsu Kaisen</a>, each bringing fan-favorite skins, themed items, and special gameplay features. With these collaborations being so successful, it makes sense that Epic Games would pursue another major anime name, such as Bleach. However, nothing is confirmed yet, so we'll have to wait until Epic Games officially announces the crossover.</p>

                <p>Developer Expression Games has released the first gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-let-loose-vietnam/">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, a hardcore 50v50 first-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bwfPLwLwQk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match.</p><p>Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements.</p><p>History buffs will also appreciate the attention to detail in this shooter, as everything from the military uniforms to the firearms players use are designed to be as historically authentic as possible. Even better, there's not a single note of Creedence Clearwater Revival music to be heard in the trailer.</p><p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will launch in 2026 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>
