                <p>Path of Exile 2 is playable now in early access, but the game's 1.0 release isn't ready yet--and it won't be here soon, it seems. Grinding Gear game director Jonathan Rogers said in an interview that the Tencent-owned studio will likely not hit the previously hinted March 2026 window.</p><p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "But as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p><p>There is no "specific timeline" for when Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release will arrive, but Rogers said he "certainly" hopes it won't be any later than the end of 2026.</p><p>"Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nH1hHyzUSk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7nH1hHyzUSk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other news, Grinding Gear has announced a new update for Path of Exile 2, The Last of the Druids, which is coming on December 12. This update allows players to become a wolf, bear, or wyvern, while the update also includes a balance overhaul, in-game performance optimization, and an expanded passive tree with more than 250 skills.</p><p>Finally, Grinding Gear announced a free weekend for Path of Exile 2, coming up December 12-15.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 was released in early access back in December 2024. You can buy the game now for $30, while it will transition to free-to-play for its 1.0 launch, whenever that comes.
