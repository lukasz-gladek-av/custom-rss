                <p>The biggest gaming announcement this week came from Valve when it revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">six-inch Steam Machine</a>, a new device coming in 2026 that will allow people to play PC games on their TV. Some have seen this as Valve attempting to enter the living room marketplace currently dominated by the mainstay platform-holders like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. But Valve apparently doesn't pay too much attention to existing consoles and instead came up with the idea for the Steam Machine by looking at the latest trends in PC gaming.</p><p>Software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that when Valve was setting out to create the Steam Machine, the company was "not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At the same time, he admitted that there ended up being "quite a bit of overlap" because the Steam Machine aims to make PC gaming "work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been."</p><p>"But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed," Griffais said. "But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general."</p><p>Rumors have suggested that Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console could take the form of a more PC-like system. In any event, Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said the company considers the Steam Machine to be a PC and not a traditional gaming console.</p><p>"The Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that," he said. "We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically."</p><p>The Steam Machine, along with Valve's new Steam Frame VR device and the next Steam controller, will launch in 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">Steam Machine pricing</a> has not been disclosed as of yet for any of the new devices, however. On the subject of pricing for the Steam Machine, Valve said it wants the system to be "affordable," but that doesn't tell us much. One analyst, Rhys Elliott, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">the "sweet spot" would be $400.</a></p><p>The Steam Machine runs the Linux-based SteamOS, similar to the Steam Deck, making the Steam Machine similar to the Steam Deck in a console form factor.</p>

This perk is the only way you can open the game's Security Lockers, extra loot boxes containing additional equipment that spawns within high-loot areas. The rewards in these Security Lockers were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/681859758979980967/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so good</a> that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/669474225528159999/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">folks across the game's community </a>were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otj4vj/security_breach_lockers_should_be_nerfed_for_sure/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">asking for Embark Studios to nerf the perk</a>. The developer has listened, confirming in the game's official Discord server that it has "adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Made Me Feel Like The Main Character | Final Preview</p>
      </div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ow0fd2/security_lockers_have_been_nerfed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a popular post on r/ArcRaiders</a>, the response appears to be positive. Most who've already unlocked the perk said that even though the Security Breach has been nerfed, they still find value in its rewards. Those who've waited to get it are happy to see a reduction in loot hoarding, while vowing to unlock it ASAP to reap the benefits.</p><p>Update 1.2.0 also fixes a handful of bugs. This includes animation glitches, audio discrepancies, map issues, and quest hang-ups. Elsewhere, the XP for looting Bastion and Bombardier ARC parts has been reduced, while the value for Launcher Ammo and Wolfpack Grenade has been increased, and various achievements should work now.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders Update 1.2.0 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li>Reduced character movement latency on the server to improve the "desync" problem where it looks like you get damaged even after being behind cover.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing quests involving multiple objectives or item collections within a single round.</li><li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly.
