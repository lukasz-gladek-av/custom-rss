                <p>As part of Take-Two's earnings report today, the company confirmed that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed and is now coming November 19, 2026. That is a delay of 5 months and 24 days from its previously scheduled May 26, 2026 release date.</p><p>"We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar said.</p><p>Take-Two's stock price took a beating after the news was announced, falling by nearly $30 per share in after-hours trading. "Rockstar Games will now release Grand Theft Auto VI on November 19, 2026, and we remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," Take-Two said.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> of the delay, "We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Zelnick said, "When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened."</p><p>He added: "We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>  — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>GTA 6 has already been delayed publicly once, as the game was originally expected to launch right around now in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed it to May 2026. At the time, Rockstar said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">needed more time to make a game that exceeded fan expectations.</a> In fact, the game's second trailer was released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">exactly six months ago today on May 6, 2025.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5, and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

Now, one player has taken his love for the game to the next level by breaking a new world record for the longest video game marathon. It only took 144 hours over the course of six days, and years of training before making the attempt.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hEKmxYvdZw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5hEKmxYvdZw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As documented on the official site for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/11/gamer-breaks-iconic-videogame-record-by-playing-dance-dance-revolution-for-six-days" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records</a>, Hungarian gamer Szabolcs Csépe--who also goes by GrassHopper--pulled off his feat between October 23-29, 2024. It's estimated that he danced to over 3,000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in that span. The previous record was set in 2015 by American gamer Carrie Swidecki, who set her mark at 138 hours 34 seconds on Just Dance.</p><p>Csépe told the site that his attempt "was the most physically demanding experience" in part because he spent hours moving without stretching. He also noted that he needed the help of a small staff of people to keep him him fed and drinking enough water to see the attempt through to the end. </p><p>"What also added to the challenge was managing and documenting all witness activities and their time allocation by myself; essentially before, during and after the record attempt," said Csépe. "Motivation is always a given with rhythm and music games! Those who love this genre can always tell that there is nothing more encouraging than dancing or doing body workout while listening to your favorite tunes."</p><p>Csépe already secured a handful of world records before this attempt, including the longest video game marathon playing a puzzle game while playing Tetris Effect for 32 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds; and the longest video game marathon playing a racing game for a 90-hour session on Gran Turismo 7. For now, Csépe hasn't decided which record to chase next.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders has been out for a week now, but how is the game performing commercially? Quite well, it appears. According to Alinea Analytics, the PvPvE game from Embark Studios has sold 2.5 million copies already, bringing in gross revenue of $100 million+ in its first seven days.</p><p>The $40 game is having the most success sales-wise on Steam, where the research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimated</a> it's sold about 1.7 million copies, or 69.2% of total sales. PlayStation followed with 400,000 units and Xbox brought up the rear with 300,000 copies sold thus far.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As an extraction shooter, Arc Raiders does not have mass-market appeal, Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said. "Extraction shooters have always attracted a core group of players who thrive on tension, consequence, and emergent storytelling. But the steep learning curve has limited wider appeal," he said.</p><p>Arc Raiders was originally going to be a free-to-play game before Embark announced it would take a paid approach instead. Elliott said free-to-play isn't the right fit for every game, and Embark may have learned some lessons from its previous game, The Finals, which is free. That game had a strong launch but tapered off over time.</p><p>Arc Raiders being a paid game may also may encourage people to stick with it, Elliott said. The game could be "stickier psychologically" because people may feel that if they paid money for something, they should keep playing. Free-to-play games, meanwhile, have a low barrier to entry and a low barrier to exit, the expert said.</p><p>Arc Raiders is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam right now</a>, and, with more than 300,000 concurrent players today, November 6, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top five for most-played games on Steam.</a></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/" data-ref-id="1900-6418435">Arc Raiders review</a> scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney said, "Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter unlike any other, a totally unpredictable, immersive, thrilling story generator directed by the community."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> has largely been well-received by players, but it's not as if it can't be improved. In particular, Battlefield 6 fans have been requesting bigger maps in Conquest, and they didn't wait around for Battlefield Studios to do it. Instead, a handful of fans have created their own big maps with Battlefield Portal and REDSEC.</p><p>Reddit users andy_6170 and kurtinthegrind have joined forces to create Club House, a Conquest play area that has plenty of space for large scale battles to break out. There are options for bots or botless versions of Club House, as well as servers that can support 64 real players. The Conquest and Tech Center options open up most of the map, while Operation Tech Center offers a smaller-scale experience in and around a single building. As described by the creators, Conquest mode features "vehicles, semi-urban areas ideal for infantry fights, and hills perfect for snipers. It's also a great map for helicopter combat!"</p><p>Separately, Battlefield lead producer David Sirland wrote on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1985980359436083539" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> that the game needs "more of the large sandbox types for sure though!" Sirland indicated that maps and weapons will be added continuously over time. He also noted that the dev team will be "looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too, of course."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1985980837293408370" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Maps and weapons is of course the biggest area we'll just keep adding to over time, so this will move in that direction for sure.<br>We are also looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too of course.</p>  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1985980837293408370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios made adjustments to Battlefield 6 to make some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-challenges-have-become-signiciantly-easier-to-complete/1100-6535960/" data-ref-id="1100-6535960">the achievements easier to complete</a>. Sirland also explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/without-battlefield-6-bots-youd-be-waiting-a-lot-longer-producer-says/1100-6535956/" data-ref-id="1100-6535956">why the bots are necessary</a> to fill up the servers in order to get matches started more quickly.</p><p>So far, Battlefield 6 has sold over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">10 million copies</a>. However, its momentum may suffer when Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s collaboration with KPop Demon Hunters is not done yet, if new leaks are to be believed. The first wave of the collab saw a bundle of skins based on the HUNTR/X trio hit the item shop, while the seasonal Horde Rush mode got a KPop Demon Hunters-themed makeover. Now, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1986484452563034475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">word is</a> that KPop Demon Hunters will return to Fortnite with a jam track for the song "Golden."</p><p>The KPop Demon Hunters collab was noticeably missing any jam tracks or dance emotes with music from the Netflix film. That absence was likely the result of how quickly the collab was put together. Since the movie wasn't expected to be such a massive hit, the deal might have gone from conception to fruition in just a couple months--that's lightning speed for something like this.</p><p>Right now, the only leak about further KPop Demon Hunters content in Fortnite is about the jam track for "Golden." It's possible that other HUNTR/X jam tracks could be added, or that a new wave of skins could come with the tracks, but there's no info about that just yet. The members of HUNTR/X are also prime candidates for the next music pass in December, but there haven't been any leaks about future Festival-season headliners.</p><p>Fortnite has followed up the packed Halloween event that introduced the KPop Demon Hunters to Epic's metaverse with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Simpsons takeover over of the main Battle Royale mode</a>, which has boosted Battle Royale and Zero Build to their highest player counts of the year so far.</p>

                <p>Square Enix is enacting a round of mass layoffs, according to multiple reports. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reported that Square Enix informed affected staff today that cuts are being made as part of a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization," referring to the company's Western business.</p><p>Cuts are beng made in Europe and America to help Square Enix become more "lean" and "agile," president Takashi Kiryu told staff. The extent of the cuts was not confirmed, but VGC reported that at almost 140 people at the London office alone were "at risk" of being laid off. </p><p>The cuts are affecting various departments, including IT, marketing, publishing, sales, QA, and business planning, the report said.</p><p>In 2024, Square Enix also made cuts to its Western teams. Square Enix also sold assets as part of its reorganization effort, selling developers like Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer. </p><p>Square Enix's latest earnings briefing included <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a slide</a> detailing how the company would conduct a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" with the aim of "further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency."</p><p>Square Enix is projecting an annual cost savings of more than 3 billion yen ($19.6 million) as part of the restructuring. Another effort Square Enix is undertaking is further adoption of AI, with the company recently announcing it wants to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">use genAI to automate 70% of game QA by 2027.</a></p>
