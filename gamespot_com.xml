                <p dir="ltr">AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. </p><p dir="ltr">AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Power and pricing</h2><p dir="ltr">AMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190"></a><figcaption>Asus is launching three RX 9060 XT models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for performance, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is positioned as the replacement for AMD's RX 7600 XT as its flagship entry-level GPU, making it the primary competitor to Nvidia's $300 GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (which costs either $380 for the 8GB version or $429 for the 16GB version). According to AMD's Computex 2025 presentation, the company's internal testing found the RX 9060 XT is roughly six percent faster than the RTX 5060 Ti on 40 games running at 1440p--and at roughly $80 MSRP cheaper. However, those tests compare the RX 9060 XT 16GB to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, rather than the RTX 5060 16GB. The RX 9060 8GB model's performance is a bigger question, as the smaller amount of VRAM could lead to significant performance dips.</p><p dir="ltr">On X (formerly Twitter), AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, Frank Azor, explained that most players use a 1080p display, for which 8GB of VRAM is more than enough. While technically true, it doesn't alleviate the concerns over confusing consumers who may see the above comparisons of the RX 9060 XT 16GB's 6% performance boost over the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and assume that applies to <em>all </em>RX 9060 XT models. And again, the actual performance will likely differ between the various SKUs launching June 5, which could further compound the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory. Most played games WW are mostly esports games. We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory…</p>  — Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find the AMD RX 9060 XT</h2><p dir="ltr">Those potential concerns and unanswered questions aside, the RX 9060 XT nevertheless looks like a solid entry-level choice for those already invested in AMD's hardware. As mentioned above, multiple manufacturers are releasing RX 9060 XT GPUs starting June 5, and while none are currently listed for preorder, you can learn more about the models announced from <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9060xt-o16g/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>, <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/components/graphics-cards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/All-Series?fid=3124" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte</a>, at each company's online store. Other brands like PowerColor also showed off upcoming RX 9060 XT GPUs on the Computex 2025 show floor. We'll be sure to update this post once the GPUs are available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a lot of different jobs to choose from in The Sims 4, including a pretty robust group of careers included with the base game and plenty more that have been added via DLC over the decade-plus that The Sims 4 has been out. What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</a><ul><li><a href="#Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</a></li><li><a href="#Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</a></li><li><a href="#Get_career_related_reward_perks">Get career-related reward perks</a></li><li><a href="#Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</a></li><li><a href="#Work_overtime">Work overtime</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Astronaut">Astronaut</a></li><li><a href="#Athlete">Athlete</a></li><li><a href="#Business">Business</a></li><li><a href="#Criminal">Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#Culinary">Culinary</a></li><li><a href="#Entertainer">Entertainer</a></li><li><a href="#Painter">Painter</a></li><li><a href="#Secret_Agent">Secret Agent</a></li><li><a href="#Tech_Guru">Tech Guru</a></li><li><a href="#Writer">Writer</a></li><li><a href="#Critic">Critic</a></li><li><a href="#Politician">Politician</a></li><li><a href="#Social_Media">Social Media</a></li><li><a href="#Conservationist">Conservationist</a></li><li><a href="#Gardener">Gardener</a></li><li><a href="#Freelancer">Freelancer</a></li><li><a href="#Military">Military</a></li><li><a href="#Education">Education</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer">Engineer</a></li><li><a href="#Law">Law</a></li><li><a href="#Style_Influencer">Style Influencer</a></li><li><a href="#Salaryperson">Salaryperson</a></li><li><a href="#Civil_Designer">Civil Designer</a></li><li><a href="#Romance_Consultant">Romance Consultant</a></li><li><a href="#Undertaker">Undertaker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_active_careers">All Sims 4 active careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Doctor">Doctor</a></li><li><a href="#Detective">Detective</a></li><li><a href="#Scientist">Scientist</a></li><li><a href="#Retail">Retail</a></li><li><a href="#Interior_Decorator">Interior Decorator</a></li><li><a href="#Reaper">Reaper</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</h3><p dir="ltr">There are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also "active" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</h3><p dir="ltr">Teens who get good grades in high school will automatically earn a career level or two in any job they take--a B GPA starts you at level 2 of every career your sim joins for the rest of their lives, and an A will let them start at the third tier. Likewise, there are specific college degrees that will help both your starting level and your performance--we'll note those below.</p><p dir="ltr">In your lifetime aspiration rewards, there are some perks you can purchase that will help a lot with any career you take on. Professional Slacker (4000 reward points) will make it so you'll never lose your job or get demoted for bad performance, and the Connections trait will make it so you start any career three levels higher than you normally would--this stacks with any bonuses you earned in high school or college as well. The Savant perk (4000 points), which increases all skill gains by 25%, will also help, as most jobs have specific skill requirements for promotions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</h3><p dir="ltr">For the most part, the job will tell you exactly what it is your sim needs to do to get ahead. Most jobs will require you to complete certain tasks while you're off the clock (homework, basically) or increase certain skills in order to earn a promotion--whatever those requirements are will be listed in the career tab in the bottom right corner of the screen. Likewise, active careers will have random tasks for your sims while they're at the office, and if you don't do at least some of them each day, you'll end up making very little money.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Work_overtime">Work overtime</h3><p dir="ltr">Some jobs allow your sim to stay two hours past the normal end of their shift, which improves their job performance and earns them overtime pay. Using that option whenever it's available can advance your career much more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, you'll also want to level up each career's relevant skills and make sure your sim is in the best mood for the job whenever possible. To help you with that, below you'll find a list of each of the normal and active careers in The Sims 4, along with a rundown on the relevant skills, ideal moods, and which college degrees are most relevant. Follow this guide, and no matter which career you put your sim in, they'll be raking in the cash and vacation days in no time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal

                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>
