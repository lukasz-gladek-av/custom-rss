                <p>In early 2023, Wizards of the Coast canceled at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">five video games that were in development</a>, including an unfinished Dungeons &amp; Dragons open-world action RPG by Hidden Path Entertainment. Now, nearly eight minutes of footage from that game have been leaked online, and while the title was far from finished, it shows real promise.</p><p>The footage originated from one of the music supervisors of the game (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>), which was known internally as Project Dante. Given the source of the video, it shouldn't be surprising that it puts a spotlight on some of the game's music. The video notes that the score was composed to seamlessly flow from the open-world theme to more specific tracks, including an ethereal theme for a temple and more forbidding notes as the heroes approached a Troll cave. A band of bards even performs an entire song while the main characters listen.</p><p>Project Dante's world looks enticing even in this early state, but the combat was clearly a work-in-progress at the time that this footage was made. There's enough here to see that this game had real potential, but it's never going to officially see the light of day. Some Project Dante's concept art has also been shared on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Imgur</a> as another glimpse of what could have been.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/" data-ref-id="1100-6531973">a new single-player D&amp;D game</a> in development by Giant Skull, a studio founded by Respawn veteran Stig Asmussen. The classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons game Neverwinter Nights 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-coming-this-summer/1100-6532271/" data-ref-id="1100-6532271">is getting an Enhanced Edition</a> later this summer. Wizards of the Coast has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games</a> are in development.</p>

                <p>Following a recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> previews, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that one fan-requested feature will be in the game when it launches in September. While a mini-map won't be in the looter-shooter, a radar will, making situational awareness of a battlefield much easier.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935803698976022970" rel="nofollow ">In a lengthy thread</a>, Pitchford spoke about how fans had been asking Gearbox to add this feature to the game--many people from the European, US, and Asian preview tours were advocating for it, Pitchford said--and the studio managed to make this happen.</p><p>"As me and head of dev, Steve Jones--and some of the other guys--were poking around with producers trying to figure out what it would take to add these features and if we could make it in time to ship or not, something awesome happened," Pitchford explained. "In classic Gearbox style, where we have an ethos of 'they who builds it, wins,' some developers got together and found some time in the margins of their schedules. Some Gearbox heroes did what Gearbox heroes do!"</p><p>Several Gearbox employees "splintered off" to work on the radar, and Pitchford says they managed to squeeze it into the game before it undergoes some QA testing ahead of its launch. The radar will be off by default when the game launches, and it won't be in the current build of Borderlands 4 on the Borderlands Fan Fest showfloor this weekend. Here's what it looks like in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 will also have a few other fan-requested features when it launches</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game has an MSRP of $70</a>. "This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ram√©e said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving at a later date.</p>

                <p>NetEase Game has announced a new game called Blood Message, which it describes as its first "AAA" single-player experience that is under development at Naraka: Bladepoint studio 24 Entertainment. Set during the final years of the Tang Dynasty, the game follows a nameless messenger and his young son as they embark on a 1,000 mile journey to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang Empire.</p><p>Fraught with peril, the trek sees the hero encounter difficult terrain and brutal sieges unfolding in the land. A trailer for the game featuring a mix of gameplay and cinematics has also been released, and you can watch it below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6IwsMWTVGI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n6IwsMWTVGI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>NetEase says players can expect "cinematic storytelling" and realistic combat that blends stealth and survival mechanics, as well as expansive landscapes inspired by East and Central Asia. At its core, the company says Blood Message is about how ordinary people leave their mark on history as unsung heroes. The story focuses on a father and his son as they navigate a collapsing world and find themselves torn between duty and family.</p><p>"We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," NetEase executive VP Zhipeng Hu said in a press statement. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p><h2>Blood Message screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"
