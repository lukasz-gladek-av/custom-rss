                <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, has discussed the "sometimes sick pleasure" of working on the post-apocalyptic series and how "storytelling is cathartic" when the real world is undergoing change and upheaval as it is today.</p><p>"There's a very healthy and sometimes sick pleasure in that kind of catharsis and a safe space to see human relationships under crisis and in pain and intelligently draw a political allegory, societal allegory, and base it off of the world that we're living in," he said, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-1236346870/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also during the call with reporters, Pascal discussed why he's excited to see The Last of Us come back for its second season, after the first was such a hit.</p><p>"I think there's something really exciting about giving everyone another season of a show that everyone loved and that everyone has worked so hard on and has put so much into," he said.</p><p>Pascal, who previously starred in HBO's Game of Thrones, returns for Season 2 in his starring role as Joel. He's joined by Bella Ramsey as Ellie, while Kaitlyn Dever joins the Season 2 cast as Abby.
