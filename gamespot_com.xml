                <p>Sea of Thieves players should be wary when Season 15 launches on February 20, as two new megalodons will be creeping in the waters. But should pirates be able to take down these fearsome sea creatures, they'll have new spots in the game's world to sell their megalodon meat.</p><p>Season 15, titled "Wild Things," expands the Hunter's Call trading company, which offers rewards and gold in exchange for fish, cooked meat, and other items. The company's vendors are scattered around the sea in tiny, lonely Seaposts, but Season 15 will incorporate them into the game's seven Outposts, according to a <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/this-month-february2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves blog post</a>.</p><p>The new megalodon variants are the Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread, with an X post from the Sea of Thieves account sharing a look at a megalodon covered in what appear to be yellow and purple crystals. The blog post states that these megalodons have "devastating new abilities" that will challenge even the most experienced buccaneers.</p><p>Players can also expect new voyages, a hunting spear item, "untamed wildlife," and other features. Eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbah25t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves fans noticed</a> a spotted variant of pig in the teaser image, which also led to speculation that players can have pigs as pets, and a treasure chest with the Hunter's Call emblem, which may indicate new types of loot.</p><p>Unlike the other trading companies in Sea of Thieves, Hunter's Call has no emissary flag or unique voyages, so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbalhwy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">players are hoping</a> Season 15 will add more to the Hunter's Call progress experience and endgame.</p><p>Until the launch of the season, pirates can participate in limited-time <a href="https://x.com/SeaOfThieves/status/1887803559414047123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Fortress Raids</a> beginning February 14 and earn tons of loot from fighting Phantoms at Sea Forts. Hopefully, Sea of Thieves Season 15 will have a smoother launch than the previous season, where developer Rare had to temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-removing-its-new-stealth-features-following-season-14-launch-issues/1100-6527342/" data-ref-id="1100-6527342">roll back some new features</a> due to technical issues.</p>

                <p>With Super Bowl LIX on Sunday with the defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, taking on the Philadelphia Eagles, all eyes are on New Orleans, with every sportsbook ready and waiting. There have already been some Madden 25 simulations from excited fans, but Mutant Football League wanted to take a stab at trying to predict the outcome.</p><p>While sadly the Superdome won't have death traps and allow powerbombs, Mutant Football League 2 has players covered. The simulation pitted the Karcass City Creeps against the Killadelphia Evils, with the Creeps taking the win. You can check the highlights below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeXvb1TchqU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NeXvb1TchqU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"In one of the bloodiest, most bone-crunching Mayhem Bowls to ever take place over, the Karcass City Creeps, led by future Hall of Maim quarterback, Hatrick Myhomies, beat the Wailen Hurtz lead Killadelphia Evils in a game that bled into overtime," the company said via press release.</p><p>"The game gave millions of viewers around the world a hefty dose of deja vu as the Creeps came from behind to [take the win] just as they did two years ago (In fact, we're not sure they actually played a new game, because we were seeing babies pitching eTrade and we're pretty sure that already happened). And just like in the first match-up of these two great franchises, late questionable calls by the refs helped pave the way to a Karcass City victory."</p><p>You can watch the full Mayhem Bowl LIX simulation <a href="https://youtu.be/a3TomoocHko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, if you want to kill time in your lunch break.</p><p>Looking at Madden's official simulations over the past 12 years, the game has predicted the correct outcome <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-super-bowl-predictions-over-the-years-how-often-does-ea-get-it-right/1100-6487137/" data-ref-id="1100-6487137">about half the time</a>. EA got off to a solid start by accurately predicting the Super Bowl winners four straight years, from Super Bowl 38 to Super Bowl 41. However since then, the simulation never got it right for more than two years in a row, though it also never got it wrong for more than two straight years.</p><p>Mutant Football League 2 is available now on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mutant-football-league-2-game-preview/9p72ljj5srx0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Preview</a> as well as on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657320/Mutant_Football_League_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>Krafton has revealed a new name and more details for its first-ever PUBG spin-off. PUBG: Blindspot, which was previously known as Project Arc when it was revealed in 2024, is a top-down shooter launching in beta on Steam later this month.</p><p>Blindspot is a 5v5 tactical shooter that aims to offer a blend of strategy and shooting from a top-down perspective. The mission in the game is to break into a crypt inside a building to install an item called a Decrypter. Players use things like grenade launchers and explosive hammers to crush the building's walls to get into the crypt. Those on the defending team can set up barricades and other preventative measures to try to stop attackers from getting in.</p><p>"PUBG: Blindspot presents real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, which creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against actual players," Krafton said.</p><p>The game features weapons like the Mk14, AWM, and P90, as well as gadgets like proximity explosives, flashbangs, and smoke grenades, among other things. Take a look at the trailer below to get a closer look at Blindspot.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jP7p9DAKKI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A free demo for Blindspot launches February 20 at 8 PM PT / 11 PM ET on Steam--the game has only been confirmed for PC. The developer said it will gather feedback from fans to help "refine and enhance" the game. A release date has not been announced.</p><p>Blindspot is the first PUBG spin-off from the popular battle royale game. It wasn't always going to be the first spin-off, though, as the horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-is-no-longer-a-pubg-spin-off/1100-6503927/" data-ref-id="1100-6503927">The Callisto Protocol was going to be until plans changed.</a></p>

                <p>Just in time for Valentine's Day, Nintendo is dropping Wario Land 4 on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on February 14. The weird Game Boy Advance platformer sees the gassy antihero turning into Zombie Wario and Bouncy Wario--just a couple of the transformations--as he explores a golden pyramid for the riches inside.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wario-land-4-review/1900-2831796/">Wario Land 4</a> originally debuted in 2001 as an early title for Game Boy Advance. It's actually the fifth mainline Wario platformer in the series when taking into account Virtual Boy Wario Land. Additionally, Wario Land 4 arrived before the WarioWare franchise even existed.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games and beyond, and now the top boss at GTA parent company Take-Two has chimed in with his thoughts. Strauss Zelnick said in an interview that artificial intelligence will be embraced as a digital tool to assist humans and that employment numbers will go up long-term as a result.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron; there's no such thing. Machine learning... machines don't learn," he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>He added: "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that history has shown time and again that the arrival of new digital technologies ultimately leads to further job creation, increased productivity, and increased GPD overall. "I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI," he said.</p><p>Others in the video game space, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a>, have admitted that advancements to AI will lead to job losses in the short term while increasing employment rates on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said Take-Two's efforts in the AI space will not infringe on other people's intellectual properties, as some have been accused of already. OpenAI, for example, is being <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sued by The New York Times</a> over claims that the AI company used its data to train its large language model. "So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own," he said.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>.</p><p>Video game voice actors remain on strike over concerns around AI, among other things. One of the more prominent voice actors, Jennifer Hale, has discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why she believes AI is an "existential" threat.</a></p>
