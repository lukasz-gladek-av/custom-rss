                <p>Buy now pay later (BNPL) services are becoming more and more popular, and now one BNPL provider has announced a deal with a gaming company to allow people to finance in-game purchases.</p><p>Affirm has partnered with gaming commerce company Xsolla to allow people to use Affirm to pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more on payment plans. Affirm offers interest-free biweekly payment plans, or longer-term monthly installments that incur interest.</p><p>This will work similarly to how it does already where Affirm is supported. For supported in-game content, players can choose Affirm at checkout, then Affirm will run a credit check, and then players can choose a payment plan that works for them. This is live now in the US and is coming to Canada and the UK soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4525052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4525052"></a><figcaption>Pay off that in-game character skin in four installments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg"></figure><p> Xsolla said it's already in business with "thousands" of game developers for its services, but a complete list of games and in-game content was not published for this Affirm partnership.

                <p>The tough times at Xbox are continuing, as Microsoft is cutting more Xbox staff. This comes at a time when Microsoft's stock price is soaring and profits are up.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> confirmed that Microsoft is cutting less than 4% of its global workforce in this latest move, including staff at Xbox. Microsoft had around 228,000 people by the latest count, so the cuts would be around 9,000 people. "We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson said.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=reddit_wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's Barcelona-based mobile game developer King is cutting 10% of its staff, which works out to around 200 people at the Candy Crush studio. Cuts at ZeniMax's European offices are coming, too.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer sent a memo to staff today addressing the cuts, saying the job losses were necessary to allow for the "enduring success" of Xbox.</p><p>"We will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness," he said.</p><p>Spencer also addressed the fact that the cutbacks are coming at a time when business is booming for Xbox. "I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," he said.</p><p>The success of Xbox today is the result of "tough decisions" Microsoft made previously, Spencer said.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>.
