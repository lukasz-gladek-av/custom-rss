                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">wide-ranging Xbox layoffs this week</a> also affected Halo Studios, the development team formerly known as 343 Industries that is working on multiple upcoming Halo titles.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Engadget </a>reported that at least five people were let go from the team, with between 200 and 300 people remaining at the company going forward. One anonymous developer told the site that they were upset with how Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">spoke about the health and prosperity of the Xbox business</a> in the same memo announcing the dramatic cuts.</p><p>"I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about," this person said.</p><p>Halo Studios has multiple upcoming Halo games in the works, and not all of them are progressing entirely smoothly, it seems. A developer told the site, "I don't think anybody is really happy about the quality of the product right now. There's been a lot of tension and pep talks trying to rally folks to ship."</p><p>Microsoft just recently announced that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-rumors-of-halo-on-ps5-and-switch-2-microsoft-confirms-halo-news-is-coming/1100-6532848/" data-ref-id="1100-6532848">share more details on the future of Halo in October</a>, and all eyes will be on the studio following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">disappointment of Halo Infinite</a>. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">made multiple major changes to its Halo team in recent times</a>, including rebranding the company to Halo Studios, installing new senior leadership, and switching development to Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>The Xbox cuts this week hit many studios, including Turn 10, Rare, ZeniMax Online Studios, Raven Software, High Moon, Sledgehammer Games, The Initiative, Blizzard, and others. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">cancelled its new Perfect Dark game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">new MMO. </a></p><p>The cuts to Xbox came as part of a wider restructuring at Microsoft, which said it was laying off fewer than 4% of its total global workforce, amounting to around 9,000 people. Despite what you might have read, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-isnt-retiring-despite-rumors-otherwise/1100-6532928/" data-ref-id="1100-6532928">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is not leaving the company. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> will be deploying its brand of managed democracy to Xbox Series X|S consoles in August. Officially announced during a livestream, the game is a co-op third-person action game in which players take on the role of a Helldiver, a soldier determined to protect Super Earth and all of its interests by any--mostly violent--means necessary.</p><p>The PlayStation-published game originally launched for PS5 and PC in early 2024, and it was one of the breakout hits of the year. <em>"</em>We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," game director Mikael Eriksson said in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years--and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmoO17UZE48" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QmoO17UZE48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Helldivers 2 on Xbox is an unusual move by Sony, because while we've seen several games from Microsoft's game studios appear on PlayStation consoles recently, the same can't be said for Sony with its titles. The company has brought several of its first-party projects--like Insomniac's Spider-Man games and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us series--to PC, but they've technically remained exclusive to PS5 and PS4 consoles. While we don't expect that to change, it is still encouraging to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-really-want-helldivers-2-on-xbox-including-some-playstation-fans/1100-6521227/" data-ref-id="1100-6521227">PlayStation-published title on Xbox</a>.</p><p>Best described as Warhammer 40K meets Starship Troopers, Helldivers 2 revolves around players achieving specific objectives on various alien planets as part of the ongoing Galactic War. While there's stiff resistance on the ground in the form of the Terminid, Automaton, and Illuminate factions, players can call in for some extra firepower from their loadout, and since launch, the game has added new weapons and tactical options to player arsenals.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-sees-players-returning-in-droves/1100-6531700/">Recent content updates have been received quite well</a> amongst the fanbase, with the recent release of the Heart of Democracy update proving to be a reinvigorating shot in the arm for the game.</p>

                <p>Romero Games, the studio headed up by John and Brenda Romero, has announced that an unspecified publisher has canceled funding for its new game, and it's believed to be Microsoft.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Brenda Romero said "our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios." She added, "This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control."</p><p>The wording and the timing suggests that Microsoft was the publisher for this new game, given Microsoft just confirmed it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceled multiple unannounced games</a>. Romero Games said years ago when its new FPS was announced that it was working with a <a href="https://www.romerogames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"major"</a> publisher, and Microsoft would fit that bill. An affected staffer at Romero Games <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said outright on social media</a> that, "Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I've lost my position at Romero Games."</p><p>Romero went on to say, "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome." She added that Romero Games "hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praises, and easily passed all our internal gates."</p><p>"We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it," she said.</p><p>Romero said the studio is now "evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team." According to an affected staffer, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/john-romeros-next-fps-has-lost-funding-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-cuts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "whole studio" is being let go.</a></p><p>In 2022, John Romero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-romero-releases-a-new-doom-2-level-donating-proceeds-to-help-people-of-ukraine/1100-6501222/" data-ref-id="1100-6501222">released a new Doom II level with all proceeds going to help the people of Ukraine.</a></p><p>If the new FPS from Romero Games was indeed canceled by Microsoft, it would join the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark in being cancelled</a> as a result of Microsoft latest changes. It was also reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">Microsoft canceled a new MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios. </a> Beyond cancelling games, Microsoft closed Perfect Dark developer The Initiative and laid off numerous people across its business.</p>
