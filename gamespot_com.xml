The studio has previously announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-borderlands-4-will-keep-you-looting-and-shooting-after-launch/1100-6534397/" data-ref-id="1100-6534397">the game's first DLC</a> is coming next year. Now, it's introducing a new vault hunter named C4sh.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XYW_fOS3k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b1XYW_fOS3k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Gearbox, C4sh is an ex-casino dealer bot turned drifter who "chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts." He--or it--will debut as part of the first story pack DLC, which includes a new tale called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. C4ash is one of two new vault hunters teased by Gearbox, but the identity of the second one has yet to be revealed.</p><p>Claptrap voice actor Jim Foronda reacted to the announcement by sharing his own "head canon' about the relationship between his character and C4sh.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">SUDDEN AND *VERY UNOFFICIAL* HEADCANON:<br>Claptrap mistakenly believes he pioneered pronouncing the 4 in one's own model number as the letter A… and now he thinks C4SH is his biggest fan on Kairos. <a href="https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn</a></p>  — Jim Foronda (@JimForonda) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>C4sh and the rest of the first story pack DLC will be released in Q1 2026. Gearbox also has plans lined up for free updates, including seasonal mini-events, invincible bosses, and other bonus content.</p><p>In the meantime, Gearbox has released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">new Borderlands 4 patch</a> to tackle some of the game's stability and performance issues. The studio has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-stuttering-on-pc-gearbox-has-an-unusual-step-to-fix-stability-issues/1100-6535046/" data-ref-id="1100-6535046">suggested an unusual step</a> to handle recurring problems on the game's PC port. Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford has made headlines by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenging players' negative reviews</a> about its optimization issues, while also offering tips for better performance on PC and consoles. Pitchford has also stated that a PS5 Pro patch is in the works as well.</p><p>Borderlands 4's upcoming Switch 2 port was previously scheduled for October 3, but it has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

                <p>Fortnite continues to lean into artificial intelligence, as developer Epic Games has <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972665777556955476" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> an AI-powered chatbot to help with Player Support inquiries.</p><p>The goal is for the Fortnite AI chatbot to help players find answers faster for their support questions. The chatbot is first rolling out in a test that will make it available only to 1% of players on Fortnite's English-language support site. Wider availability for the chatbot will come later, Epic said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-launches-beta-for-ai-chatbot-that-reads-your-xbox-profile/1100-6531875/" data-ref-id="1100-6531875">Microsoft rolled out its own AI chatbot to help Xbox users with a variety of things.</a></p><p>Before this, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">used AI to replicate the late James Earl Jones' voice to bring a Darth Vader to Fortnite</a> as a character people could converse with. After this, Epic Games announced an AI-powered NPC Persona device that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-be-just-the-beginning-of-fortnites-ai-implementation/1100-6532094/" data-ref-id="1100-6532094">allows users to create their own AI-powered characters.</a></p><p>Game developers have used artificial intelligence technologies for a long time already, but things have progressed quickly of late due to new advancements for things like generative AI. The use of AI technologies in game development has proven controversial as well, as people fear things like job losses and plagiarism issues.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, with Halloween right around the corner, a leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-are-you-next-rumored-guests-for-fortnites-halloween-party/1100-6535058/" data-ref-id="1100-6535058">characters from the popular Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters</a> will come to Fortnite for the Fortnitemares 2025 event. This is expected to start in early October, but we don't know for sure when it will be just yet. Even so, there have been plenty of leaks about what we can expect to see from this year's spooky festivities, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">you can read all about them here</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Epic Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fornite-disables-john-cena-emote-after-major-peacemaker-s2-twist/1100-6535083/" data-ref-id="1100-6535083">removed a John Cena emote following a major Peacemaker Season 2 twist.</a></p>

                <p>In 2020, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/" data-ref-id="1100-6473383">left the company</a> after over two decades as one of the driving forces behind the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. While Houser has since launched a new company, Absurd Ventures, he recently shared his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and explained why Bully 2 never materialized.</p><p>During a panel appearance at Los Angeles Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>), Houser was asked about how he feels regarding GTA 6, the first Grand Theft Auto game in decades that he had no involvement with.</p><p>"I think it's a great privilege to have worked on something that big--you know, I wrote the last 10 or 11 of them, so I think the world's probably had enough GTA from me ... There's always a new story, so it's not going to be a story that I wrote or a character set that I developed. I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure."</p><p>Houser has previously voiced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-on-bully-sequel-i-know-i-want-to/1100-6414948/" data-ref-id="1100-6414948">his desire to see a sequel</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, the 2006 game set at a boarding school. When he was asked about the reasons why Bully 2 didn't come to pass, Houser cited "bandwidth issues," before adding, "If you've got a small lead creative team and a a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want ... With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p><p>Picking a favorite game from his time at Rockstar proved to be difficult for Houser. He noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> was "the best thing that I worked on [and the] best single kind of realization of open-world storytelling thematic consistency and understanding how the games are assembled to take you on an an emotional journey." He also cited GTA 4, GTA 5, Bully, and Red Dead Redemption as some of his best experiences at Rockstar.</p><p>Houser's next project is a comic book miniseries called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-boss-american-caper-comic-book-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6535074/" data-ref-id="1100-6535074">American Caper</a>, which will be released by Dark Horse Comics on November 12. He also said that Absurd Ventures' first video games will be a currently untitled "open-world third-person comedy," and A Better Paradise, which he described as "a third-person dystopian tragedy." Both games are still early in development.</p>

                <p>A new Lord of the Rings game is in development and is a third-person action game designed to "compete with Hogwarts Legacy," according to a new report.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> said it heard from sources close to the project that the unannounced and untitled game is funded, in part, by the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), to the tune of around $100 million USD. A deal could be made public as soon as next week, the report said.</p><p>In addition to ADIO, the rumored new Lord of the Rings game is said to involve Embracer, which is the company that owns the rights to Lord of the Rings games (and other extensions of the fantasy series). The developer Revenge is said to be involved as well.</p><p>A spokesperson for Embracer said, "We do not comment on rumors or speculation." The developer Revenge declined to comment as well when approached by Insider Gaming.</p><p>The report had no specific details on the supposed new Lord of the Rings game, so it's unclear at this stage what it means that the game could be designed to compete with Hogwarts Legacy. That game, released in 2023, was an enormous success, becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">No. 1 best-selling game of the year in the US.</a> A sequel is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">now a top priority at Warner Bros.</a></p><p>As for The Lord of the Rings, games based on the franchise have not fared all that well of late. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum had such a troubled launch in 2023 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gollum-studios-next-lotr-game-canceled-dev-no-longer-making-games-at-all/1100-6515620/" data-ref-id="1100-6515620">its developer canceled its next game and stopped making games altogether.</a> This year's Tales of the Shire got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-the-shire-review-concerning-and-also-there-are-hobbits/1900-6418389/" data-ref-id="1900-6418389">mixed reviews.</a></p><p>The existence of a new Lord of the Rings game from Embracer is no surprise at all, as the company said more than a year ago that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lord-of-the-rings-games-being-prototyped-right-now/1100-6525818/" data-ref-id="1100-6525818">prototyping multiple new games.</a> Before this, Embracer's Lord of the Rings boss, Lee Guinchard, spoke about how <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he wants there to be a renaissance for Lord of the Rings games.</a></p><p>In addition to this new mysterious project, Embracer is working with Amazon Games currently on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-lord-of-the-rings-games-on-the-way/1100-6514561/" data-ref-id="1100-6514561">new MMO in the Middle-earth universe</a>.</p><p>There have been many iconic Lord of the Rings games over the years. In particular, some of the early movie tie-ins were well-received, while the more recent Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War were enjoyable as well--but developer Monolith has since shut down. On the less-serious side, there are also Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego The Hobbit titles that are fondly remembered. Check out the gallery below to see some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-games-ranked/1100-6503738/" data-ref-id="1100-6503738">best Lord of the Rings games ever.</a></p><p>Beyond video games, Embracer is working with Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on multiple upcoming films, including The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in Peter Jackson's original The Lord of the Rings series, is coming back to direct this film.</p>
