                <p>You'll soon be able to try out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disco-elysium/" data-ref-id="5000-465081">Disco Elysium</a>'s mobile version, which developer ZA/UM describes as a "total reimagination." The studio announced recently that the game launches on August 5 for Android devices, with the first two chapters offered for free as a demo.</p><p>Rather than a direct port, ZA/UM has rebuilt the game in an attempt to make it better complement smaller devices. While the original Disco Elysium is an isometric story-based RPG with full movement controls, the mobile version repackages the art style, characters, and narrative into something more akin to a visual novel. It is now played from a first-person point of view, but you're not moving the character. Rather, you survey rooms and look for items or points of interest to investigate, and all of the interactivity is designed around touch screens.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ‘Disco Elysium For The TikTok User’ Gave Me An Existential Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p>ZA/UM has talked about how this approach is an effort to "completely cater to the habits of today's mobile users." In addition, the developer is emphasizing that the mobile version is more compatible with quick, pick-up-and-play gaming, stating, "This story-rich adventure has been optimized for short play sessions, allowing players to dive in anytime, anyplace on their mobile devices."</p><p>While this type of description might dissuade some players from checking this version out, GameSpot recently had a chance to preview the game on an Android tablet and came away quite impressed. Check out early impressions from our own Lucy James in the embed above.</p><p>If you try out the free chapters and want to grab the full game, Disco Elysium for Android will cost $10 when it launches on August 5. ZA/UM has not yet announced details about an iOS release, but chances are good that it'll come to more devices in the future.</p><p>This might be the only new Disco Elysium-related product in the works, though. Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-expansion-and-sequel-canceled-report/1100-6521118/" data-ref-id="1100-6521118">significant upheaval and controversy</a>, ZA/UM canceled a sequel and expansion and shifted its focus to a new title, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/" data-ref-id="1100-6530033">Project C4</a>. Highlighting espionage, intelligence, and betrayal, the game will be an RPG inspired by novels like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.</p>

Regardless, producer and showrunner Adi Shankar already has some thoughts on where Devil May Cry is going in the upcoming season.</p><p>Shankar wrote on <a href="https://x.com/adishankarbrand/status/1937038302496092250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> that Season 2 will be a very different show, adding "Dante levels up. His skills improve and you'll see him embrace more of the iconic badassery fans of the game expect. That said, I'm still telling a story, and great characters don't just win--they grow. What makes Dante compelling isn't that he's unstoppable--it's that he learns and keeps getting stronger."</p><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/adishankarbrand/status/1937191683340530120" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Shankar confirmed the inclusion of gunsmith Nell Goldstein from the first Devil May Cry novel and indicated that she will have a mother/son dynamic with Dante.</p><p><strong>There are spoilers ahead for Devil May Cry Season 1.</strong></p><p>Devil May Cry wrapped up its first season with Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) captured and placed in stasis by DARKCOM, while his long-missing brother, Vergil (Robbie Daymond), made his presence known in the final moments by freeing DARKCOM's captured demons so they can serve the master of Hell, Mundus.</p><p>Shankar recently disclosed that he has purchased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/castlevania-and-devil-may-cry-anime-producer-buys-duke-nukem-rights/1100-6532601/" data-ref-id="1100-6532601">the rights to adapt the Duke Nukem video game franchise</a>, but didn't elaborate whether it will also be an animated series.

<p dir="ltr">Addressing the complaints of PvE-focused players who felt locked out of the endgame, Byblos laid out Funcom's goals.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame," Bylos wrote. "Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in."</p><p dir="ltr">While PvE players will now be able to venture in the Deep Desert, Bylos said those who are playing solo will find the experience grindy. The endgame will remain balanced around guilds and groups, and the most lucrative resources and spice fields in the Deep Desert will still be high-risk, high-reward PvP zones, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Bylos additionally addressed the Scout Ornithopter meta that is currently dominating warfare in the Deep Desert, in which the flying vehicles have become essential to competitive play. Having recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">removed the ability to deal damage</a> to other players by ramming them with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a>, Funcom will soon introduce even more changes to bring the all-mighty Ornithopter down a few notches. Those changes will range from bigger penalties for those who equip Scout Ornithopters with rockets, to an additional way for players to deal with the thopters in the form of a new rocket launcher. Bylos said that Ornithopters, while important, shouldn't be dominant force in PvP battles</p><p dir="ltr">"We have infantry and ground vehicles and air vehicles, and they're all supposed to have clear roles, clear strengths, and clear counters," Bylos said. "'Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn't be the dominant force in actual battles. We're planning to make more changes to the Deep Desert to accommodate ground battles and reinforce the use of player builds."</p><p dir="ltr">The Landsraad, another endgame system, is set to receive changes as well. Bylos acknowledged that the system "isn't exactly in the right place," and will be updated to provide more "micro rewards" for solo players and small groups. As many of the Landsraad tasks currently revolve around turning in large numbers of resources or crafted items, the current system rewards stockpiling materials ahead of time to turn in as soon as a task is revealed. Bylos said that isn't the intention behind the system and that Funcom will be looking to make changes "best we can."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite endgame complaints from PvE players since its June 5 "advanced access" launch, Dune: Awakening continues to be a big success on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The sci-fi survival game recently reached a new concurrent-player record of 189,000 players, according to SteamDB. Alongside endgame changes, Funcom also announced Dune: Awakening has sold one million copies, making it the fastest-selling game in the studio's history.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> was visually arresting when it launched on PS4, taking Guerrilla's Decima Engine and applying it in ways not explored by the studio's Horizon series. With the sequel, Kojima Productions has yet again delivered a game that pushes boundaries visually, with some key enhancements on some of the engine's improvements we've already seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2</a> crams a lot of detail into its gorgeously sparse open world, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-death-stranding-2-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noting how high the image quality is and how far details stretch out before having to taper off to keep performance in check. It makes static images of Death Stranding 2 look pristine and almost life-like, with that illusion maintained in motion. Digital Foundry notes how impressive the various weather effects in the game are, with specific mention of how water physics have been improved on over Horizon's implementation to account for more dynamic behavior for gameplay purposes. You can watch the full technical breakdown below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApWCtAuKcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ApWCtAuKcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In testing, Death Stranding 2 sticks to its two performance targets, staying locked to either 30 or 60 frames per second depending on the mode you chose on PS5 or PS5 Pro. Better yet, choosing performance mode on either console runs the game inside a 120Hz container on supported displays, offering more responsive inputs in tandem with the dependable performance.</p><p>Differences between Sony's two consoles aren't as stark as you might expect, with both aiming for 1440p outputs and using the Decima Engine's own approach to upscaling to 4K. Digital Foundry notes that this causes some image instability on the original PS5 where the image looks cleaner on the PS5 Pro, perhaps thanks to the more powerful console sticking closer to a native 1440p most of the time.</p><p>The bigger differences are between the Quality and Performance modes on PS5, which Digital Foundry notes have enough of a gulf between them that players might prefer the lower framerate albeit shaper quality mode. On PS5 Pro, the difference between the two is so imperceptible that the publication suggests just sticking with the Performance mode.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is out soon for players who have ordered the game's Deluxe Edition, granting 48 hours early access before the game launches for everyone on 26 June. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a>, writer Diego Nicolás Argüello notes that the sequel sticks too closely to its predecessor at times, writing, "This second iteration doesn't feel as arresting as it mired in familiar story beats, a disappointing lack of friction, and an obsession with doubling down on the weaker aspects of Death Stranding."</p>

<section><p>Call me, Rhem.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Prior to attending <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/day-of-the-devs-summer-game-fest-edition-2025-everything-revealed/2900-6641/" data-ref-id="2900-6641">Summer Game Fest</a>, I had heard exceedingly little about Heart Machine's upcoming title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>. Admittedly, this might be because I was a bit tapped out; for as big of a fan I was of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, the studio's newer releases--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/solar-ash-review-ash-wins-day/1900-6417797/" data-ref-id="1900-6417797">Solar Ash</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-update-brings-a-more-traditional-roguelike-experience/1100-6531151/" data-ref-id="1100-6531151">Hyper Light Breaker</a>--didn't capture me the same way Drifter's lush-yet-somber world did. It seemed to me that Heart Machine was building upon the parts of their legacy that I found less compelling, emphasizing fast, fluid traversal and breadth in exploration rather than depth. Don't get me wrong--I <em>liked </em>both Solar Ash and Hyper Light Breaker, but they didn't captivate me--and their trajectory made me unsure if a new Heart Machine title ever would. Fortunately, a brush with Possessor(s) has proven me <em>very </em>wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">Billed as a search-action game--a more game-neutral term to describe the metroidvania genre--Possessor(s) marks a shift to the second dimension for Heart Machine and combines fast-paced, side-scrolling action (a la Metroid) with Dark Souls-inspired mechanics to create a tense, brutal, and gorgeous adventure game that emphasizes continuous discovery. Whereas the studio has previously shipped titles with more abstract stories and characters that aren't particularly humanoid in appearance, Possessor(s) also seems to mark a pivot towards a more traditional version of storytelling, with hand-drawn, swoon-worthy characters that dish out plot beats and dialogue with accompanying character art, similarly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275"></a><figcaption>Rhem speaks to Luca.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So far, this description contains <em>a lot</em> of comparisons to some incredibly beloved games, so I want to emphasize that despite this, in the section I played, I didn't find Possessor(s) to be overly derivative. Although it pulls inspiration from some of my favorite titles and I'd argue I didn't see anything that reinvents or refines its genres, its urban-horror setting, lustrous art direction, overall tone, and budding narrative feel both distinctly Heart Machine and like a new direction for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a world being overtaken by dimension-hoping demons, Possessor(s) kicks off with main character Luca watching one of her loved ones get ripped apart by a demon while pinned under a pile of debris. Eventually, she is able to move out from underneath it, only to find both her legs have been severed from her body. After a few moments spent crawling and crying out for help, she finds it in the shape of a tall, dark, and handsome individual named Rhem--who also just so happens to be one of the demons terrorizing humanity. Rhem tells Luca he can graft her new legs and save her life, so long as she enters a pact with him that will help save his life, too. She reluctantly agrees, and the two form a unique bond that ties both their souls to Luca's body.</p><p dir="ltr">As the two proceed, Rhem alludes to Luca not understanding the demons' motives or the true purpose of a global corporation associated with household appliances and creating better living for its customers. This ultimately sets up a mystery for Luca to unravel, causes all the game's evil, inanimate object enemies to make a whole lot more sense, and creates a path forward for her and Rhem's coexistence. Although not entirely novel--science-fiction and corrupt corporations tend to go hand-in-hand--it's still an interesting premise made more compelling by its macabre leanings, fantastic character art, and the overall atmosphere of the decaying urban sprawl I explored.</p><p dir="ltr">Most importantly, however, Possessor(s)' gameplay feels great. It's fluid, fun, delightfully difficult, and, based on the portion of the map I saw, seems like it will offer up a large, dense world ripe for exploration. Though some metroidvanias (or search-action games) leave room for hack-and-slash style gameplay, Possessor(s) requires a level of dexterity and intention that reflects the team's desire to incorporate souls-like elements into it. It also includes "bonfires" and a world that resets once you rest, further emphasizing that influence.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) has already impressed me, and with its promises of a complex narrative that allows you to play through multiple paths and meet a variety of characters with their own "heartbreaking" stories, it has quickly become one of my most anticipated releases of 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">More Battlefield footage continues to emerge online ahead of the new game's official reveal. This alleged leak suggests a first look at the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">single-player campaign</a>, as it shows off in-development footage of a campaign mission.</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent game, Battlefield 2042, didn't feature a campaign. If this leak is legitimate, it shows off DICE's progress on the campaign for this next release. As shown below, the <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared footage</a> seemingly comes from DICE's playtest known as Battlefield Labs, and the video features "work-in-progress" footage from a campaign-mission ending centered around destroying a dam in Tajikistan.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Here's a short clip from the Battlefield 6 singleplayer campaign in the latest BF Labs update.<br>This work-in-progress footage shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan. <a href="https://t.co/n9ikBpUrmQ" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/n9ikBpUrmQ</a></p>  — temporyal (@temporyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Previously, a video surfaced that showed some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-leak-shows-off-tank-vs-tank-mayhem/1100-6532084/">tank-vs-tank mayhem</a>, which gave classic Battlefield vibes with tank warfare and engineers stopping to repair one player's tank. The leaked footage has since been removed.</p><p dir="ltr">It's uncertain if this game will be called Battlefield 6 or given another title. EA has said it will officially reveal the new Battlefield game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">at some point this summer</a> and then release the title by the end of March 2026. The recent GTA 6 delay could potentially offer an earlier release time, as EA has now said the game's launch window is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">clearer than before</a>."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 2042 is still getting new DLC. Most recently, the game included add-on content as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-adds-mass-effect-dlc/1100-6532493/">crossover with Mass Effect</a>.</p>
