                <p>The partnership between Xbox and IHOP kicked off in November with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">special-edition custom pancake Xbox</a> and a menu inspired by Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Now it's come to light that the partnership also includes the opportunity to get Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for "free" if you spend enough money at IHOP.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1866167680635691190" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, one of the perks of joining IHOP's loyalty program is the opportunity to earn PanCoins, which can be exchanged for a free copy of the game. It doesn't come cheap, though. Members earn one PanCoin for every $5 spent, and to unlock The Great Circle, you need 40 PanCoins ($200).</p><p>The Great Circle isn't the only game available, though, as 40 PanCoins also gets you a copy of Sea of Thieves, which is a completely different type of game. Meanwhile, 15 PanCoins gets you a one-month trial for Game Pass Ultimate. You can <a href="https://www.ihop.com/en/rewards/xbox-stack-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see all the available rewards on IHOP's website.</a></p><p>Of course, eating a lot of breakfast food is not the most direct or logical way to go about getting your hands on The Great Circle. After all, the game is included with Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) and PC Game Pass ($12/month), and is also available for direct purchase starting at $70 USD. As it happens, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-steeply-discounted-just-in-time-for-indiana-jones/1100-6526404/" data-ref-id="1100-6526404">Game Pass is steeply discounted right now</a>, just in time for the launch of The Great Circle.</p><p>The Great Circle is out now on Xbox and PC, and will come to PlayStation 5 in Spring 2025.

                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> will be shown off at The Game Awards this week. On Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford teased</a> that the next look at the upcoming game will contain a mix of gameplay and a "never-before-seen original cinematic sequence" set halfway between the end of Borderlands 3 and the beginning of Borderlands 4.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer!

While there has been a trickle of information--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">like one of the new planets</a> being shown off in concept art--details on the playable Vault Hunters, the next big villain, or if Claptrap will ever get people to attend his pizza party have been kept locked up tighter than an Eridian vault.</p><p>One snippet of information that Pitchford did confirm was that the antagonist for the game won't be Handsome Jack, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">as something "far more dangerous"</a> than the legendary Hyperion CEO will be threatening players. While this will be a first look at the game for many fans this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminally-ill-fan-was-able-to-play-borderlands-4-early-and-he-says-its-amazing/1100-6528091/" data-ref-id="1100-6528091">a terminally ill Borderlands fan</a> named Caleb McAlpine managed to get a sneak peek at the game after Gearbox heard of his request to see it.</p><p>Borderlands 4 was officially revealed during the opening night of Gamescom in August, and the game is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025. Publisher Take-Two Interactive plans to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">comfortable gap between Borderlands 4 and Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, as it wants to avoid cannibalizing potential sales.</p>

                <p>Considering that it's taken over a decade for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to reach players, expectations are sky high for Rockstar Games' next GTA installment. That anticipation and the hype behind it are being parodied on PlayStation Store with a page for Grand Taking Ages 6, a game that may or may not actually exist.</p><p>The listing for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages 6</a> appears to have gone online around December 7, and it features what appears to be AI-generated art in the vein of GTA 6 along with a synopsis that suggests it will put players in charge of their own game studio simulation. According to the description, it allows fans to "run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses." It also claims the game will be released in May 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg"></figure><p>The page includes fake review quotes from GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer "from [a] parallel universe where the game is already out." It also features a dedication to the players who didn't live long enough to see Grand Taking Ages 6's release, before adding that "PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will."</p><p>While a game developer tycoon game like this could be an intriguing indie title, this parody doesn't seem to have a real game behind it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-vi-pops-up-on-the-playstation-store-once-again-reminding-us-that-curation-basically-doesnt-exist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> notes that the developer listed, Violarte sp. z o. O., only recently launched an official site with "fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI." In other words, this appears to be a joke, but it does call into question how it was able to pass review before it was listed on PSN. </p><p>The first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">recently had its one-year anniversary</a> without a follow-up trailer. A developer from Rockstar also promised "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-teases-mind-blowing-things/1100-6527967/" data-ref-id="1100-6527967">absolutely mind-blowing things</a>" in the sequel while accepting GTA 6's Most Anticipated Game award at the Golden Joysticks. Nearly a month ago, Rockstar confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">remains on track for a Fall 2025 release</a> onPlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
