                <p>Marvel Snap was made unavailable in the US shortly after the TikTok ban went into effect on January 19. This was presumably because the game's publisher, Nuverse, was owned at the time of its release by TikTok parent company Bytedance. However, TikTok has now come back online, but Marvel Snap hasn't yet.</p><p>"Unfortunately, Marvel Snap is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the US.

Marvel Snap, at this time, however, is still unavailable for US players.
