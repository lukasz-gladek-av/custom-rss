                <p>Bandai Namco Entertainment and From Software have just released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and are already teasing its first post-launch update. Patch 1.02 is scheduled to release sometime next week and will improve the solo experience of playing this co-op game.</p><p>"Next week, Patch 1.02 will be released, and will include several bug fixes as well as improvements for solo expeditions," the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring account on X</a> explained. While the full patch notes won't be released until next week, the account did tease some important updates coming to solo expeditions in Nightreign. After Patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once per night-boss battle and gain more runes (a form of in-game currency) while playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>  â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nightreign remixes the critically acclaimed 2022 game from Dark Souls creator From Software into a more multiplayer-focused experience where players take on tough bosses together. That said, players also have the option of going on these expeditions alone if they really want to, although even GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> admits that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." After Patch 1.2, Nightreign should feel more welcoming to those solo players.</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-warned-of-pc-performance-issues-in-day-one-patch-notes/1100-6531903/" data-ref-id="1100-6531903">received a day-one patch</a> that implemented some last-minute balance adjustments and warned of PC performance problems. It's currently unknown if Patch 1.02 will fix any of those performance issues. None of these balance, PC performance, or solo play issues have prevented Nightreign from becoming an instant success, though. It has already been confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million people</a> have played Elden Ring Nightreign on its first day.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

This will be hosted by Geoff Keighley (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Summer Game Fest</a>, The Game Awards), and the event will be held inside the Orpheum Theatre. In case you can't make it, this showcase will also be livestreamed.</p><p>In addition to Keighley, Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima will also be present, and there'll be a panel discussion with special guests. An "exclusive" live demonstration of Death Stranding 2 will be held and <a href="https://cvent.me/B14PXm" rel="nofollow ">you can sign up through this link if you're interested in attending</a>. Ahead of the game's release, Sony and Kojima Productions are also going international with Death Stranding 2 events taking place in Sydney, Paris, Seoul, and several other cities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOV2Rx-ncxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOV2Rx-ncxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>New details on the game were also revealed this week through the game's official site. Death Stranding 2 takes place 11 months after the first game, and the gameplay has been expanded with a day-and-night cycle, natural disasters, and new mechanized enemies that will menace protagonist Sam Porter Bridges. One of the big features from the first game being upgraded for the sequel is the Social Strand System, as you'll be able to grow your reputation and access new gear and resources on your journey.</p><p>In case you missed it, a new marketing campaign in Japan <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/">revealed a brief look at the game</a>, albeit through a Prepper ASMR lens that isn't nearly as exciting as the previous trailer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/">and its tease of Pacific Rim-like fights</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">Fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a> right now.</p>
