                <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> seem to get that skating is a style thing as much it is a lifestyle. The board itself doesn't make the skater cool, but the bevy of customization options that'll be present at Skate's early access launch certainly will.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> from its developers, customization will be a crucial part of the experience, and it's the first thing players will do upon booting up the game. At that point, players will be able to fine tune many aspects of their avatar, such as their body shape, height, as well as tons of aspects of their face, and more.</p><p>The way that your characters moves when they're off the board--a setting that the developers are calling Locomotion--is also customizable, and you can even select gestures, which can be done both on-and-off-board.</p><p>Naturally, players will also get to trick out their clothes and boards as well, and completing challenges and missions throughout the game will net them a currency called Rip Chips. This currency is used to buy Skate's equivalent of loot boxes and increase what the team is calling a Rip Score, which sounds like an in-game leveling system. Raising your Rip Score will be a surefire way to keep unlocking more customization options, such as helmets, skirts, and shoes for the player, as well as trucks, stickers, and grip tape for your deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295" data-ratio="0.56309523809524" data-width="840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295"></a><figcaption>A skater's gotta grind. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550297,1300-4550298,1300-4550299,1300-4550300,1300-4550301" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"></figure><p>Speaking of, considering Skate will be free-to-play, it will also offer players the chance to score cosmetics via microtransactions. The Skate Shop will accept the game's premium currency, called San Van Bucks, and will be used for direct purchases, not loot boxes that leave things to chance. Alongside the shop, seasons, which are expected to run around three months at a time, and the Skate Pass should also be considered avenues by which the player can get even more cosmetics.</p><p>At the end of the update, the developers behind Skate acknowledge the possibility of sharing custom gear created by other players considering the new game's emphasis on user-generated content. Despite this, it doesn't outright confirm that it will be in the game, at least at launch, saying that when it has "something concrete to share, like a timeline, we'll make sure to let you know."</p><p>Suffice to say, there will be lots of ways to trick yourself and your board out when Skate launches and beyond. In the meantime, its most recent playtest has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-reboot-has-over-1-million-sign-ups-for-latest-playtest/1100-6533473/" data-ref-id="1100-6533473">surpassed a million signups</a>, representing an early and promising milestone for the game ahead of its release into early access later this summer. Skate will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, with mobile versions planned to come to iOS and Android at a later time.</p>

Additionally, respawn timers have been adjusted on both Rush and Breakthrough so that defender respawns are now fixed at 12 seconds, having previously been between 6-12 seconds. One other change on Breakthrough makes it so fewer players are needed on an objective in order to speed up the capture time.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush<br>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture.

Combined with the smaller sizes of the maps featured in the Battlefield 6 beta, and this iteration of Rush doesn't seem to have won over many fans, with one longtime <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield content creator</a> stating he would rather see the mode removed until it's "been properly worked on," citing poor map balance.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may alleviate some of the issues fans have had with Rush in Battlefield 6, something that one of the game's producers said the full game will have. Battlefield 6 will launch with a total of nine maps, four of which are currently playable in the second open beta weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the Rush complaints and some issues revolving around its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enabling-secure-boot-for-battlefield-6-is-turning-into-a-nightmare-for-some/1100-6533811/" data-ref-id="1100-6533811">Secure Boot requirement on PC</a>, Battlefield 6's beta has already been a big success, surpassing both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a> and that of previous Battlefield games on Steam.

As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-fans-paint-savehytale-art-over-riot-games-office-on-wplace-protesting-its-cancellation" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, the location of Riot Games' headquarters in Santa Monica has been targeted with a large art piece accompanied with the message "#SaveHytale" and the Hytale logo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOXtd-WzRxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xOXtd-WzRxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Riot Games is the owner of the studio Hypixel, which announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/">cancellation of the Minecraft-inspired sandbox game</a> in June after a decade of development. The developer had also announced the winding down of operations.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Dragon Age fans have also taken to Wplace to protest EA (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-remastered-trilogy-cancelled-by-ea-fans-angry-messages-on-wplace/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>) following reports that that proposals for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/">remaster of the Dragon Age Trilogy had been rejected</a> by the publisher.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 10 will introduce a new, more powerful type of Unique item called Chaos Armor that will take an existing Unique and convert it into a different armor slot, opening up even more build possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed the new item type in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> ahead of Diablo 4 Season 10's upcoming PTR playtest, where it also dove into details on how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-diablo-4-season-10-ptr-is-shaking-up-infernal-hordes/1100-6533978/" data-ref-id="1100-6533978">shaking up its Infernal Hordes</a> endgame activity.</p><p dir="ltr">A Chaos Armor Unique item will always appear at maximum power and have at least one greater affix, often making them stronger than the normal version of that Unique. But the fact that they are stronger isn't the biggest change. Normally, Uniques are just that: unique. Each Unique has only ever been available for one armor slot. If you found a Fists of Fate, that item is specifically for the glove slot. If you found a Razorplate, that is specifically a piece of chest armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267"></a><figcaption>An example of a Chaos Armor version of the Banished Lord's Talisman Unique.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not the case with Chaos Armor, which takes an existing Unique item and makes it so it has a chance to appear as an item for another gear slot. Instead of a chestpiece, a Chaos Armor Razorplate could be a helm, for example, or Fists of Fate could be a pair of boots instead. The change opens up new builds for Diablo 4's classes in a huge way, allowing players to create new combinations of Unique items that weren't previously possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There are really only two downsides to Chaos Armor. One is that you can't equip a Chaos Armor version of a Unique and the original Unique at the same time (which you probably wouldn't want to do anyways), and the second is that there won't be Chaos Armor versions for an item's originally intended gear slot. Once again using Razorplate as an example, that means if your thorn build currently uses Razorplate in the chest slot, you won't be able to snag a Chaos Armor Razorplate for that same slot to serve as a slightly better version of what you were already using. Instead, you'll have to get creative and come up with some new item options for whatever slot that Unique previously occupied.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, finding new Uniques will be even easier in Season 10 as well, as Blizzard also outlined how it's improving loot drops. Unique items will have a higher chance to drop across all difficulties, and Magic and Rare items will no longer appear as rewards from Whispers or quests when playing on Torment difficulty.
