                <p dir="ltr">Popular indie FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortunes-run/">Fortune's Run</a> won't be seeing any updates for a while--about three years, to be precise, as that's how long its sole developer, known only as Dizzie, will be spending behind bars.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development," Dizzie <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">shared in a post</a> on the game's Steam page. "I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years. It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGagabyqUc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7WGagabyqUc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this," he added. "I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions."</p><p dir="ltr">Described by Dizzie as a "fast-paced melee boom-shoot fighting game platformer action immersive sim role-playing fever dream adventure story," Fortune's Run's only other developer recently left the project. According to Dizzie, his former co-developer left for a number of reasons, one of which was a series of struggles she faced after what the post describes as a "botched surgery."</p><p dir="ltr">"The other developer has left the project," Dizzie wrote. "Once she recovered [from surgery], she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of QA and a few level segments, all of which have been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone, but I actually managed--by basically not sleeping--to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away."</p><p dir="ltr">"Since we decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," He continued. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p dir="ltr">The dev added that he is "no longer in financial dire straits" since Fortune's Run "actually sold OK," and noted that he "should be able to afford rent" once he's released from prison.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a chance that if you wait a few years, I'll be able to cap off the release," he wrote. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that "the game isn't <em>totally</em> dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen [to it]."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie's identity--and the crime for which he is being incarcerated--are not known to the public, though he admits in the blog post that his sentence is the result of violence on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a very violent person [in the past] and I hurt a lot of people in my life," he wrote. "Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that another Fortune's Run update is in the works and will be released before he begins serving his sentence.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah. What about the update, huh? I'm going to put that in the next news post, because it feels weird to uh, put patch notes at the bottom of this blog post."</p>
