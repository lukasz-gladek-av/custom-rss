                <p>Today, Netflix is doubling down on gaming by introducing a mixture of new and established games that you can play on your TV, as long as you've got your phone and your password.</p><p>Five Netflix's party games--Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers--were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-new-batch-of-games-can-be-played-straight-on-your-tv-no-controller-required/1100-6535331/" data-ref-id="1100-6535331">revealed by Lego and Netflix</a> last month.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0vMhc-V4qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o0vMhc-V4qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the the newly revealed titles is Dead Man's Party: A Knives Out Game, which is based on the Knives Out detective movies starring Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. Players can either help Blanc solve a murder, or attempt to cover their tracks if they turn out to be the killer.</p><p>Younger gamers can play Barbie Color Creations, Toca Boca Hair Salon 4, and Paw Patrol Academy. Some of the upcoming Netflix games include ports of WWE 2K25 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-rated-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536175/" data-ref-id="1100-6536175">Red Dead Redemption</a>.</p><p>"Starting today, you can play games on your TV, using your phone as a controller," said Netflix's president of games, Alain Tascan. "No setup needed, it's as easy as streaming your favorite shows. You can now go from watching KPop Demon Hunters to playing Pictionary: Game Night without ever leaving Netflix. And for those who love to play anywhere and everywhere, we're bringing even more games to your phone with our own special Netflix touch."</p><p>Additionally, Netflix is introducing the Puzzled app, which offers players eight daily puzzle games centered around the streamer's shows and movies including Stranger Things and KPop Demon Hunters.</p>

                <p>Valve has a new Steam Machine on the way next year, but if you have a long memory, you'll remember that this isn't the first time that the company has attempted to bring PC gaming to the living room. The original line of Steam Machine mini-PCs launched back in 2015, but poor sales eventually saw these devices fade quietly into the background. So what's to stop history from repeating itself? According to Valve, a better video game catalogue and an effort to give developers an easier time when porting games over to the new Steam Machine are some of the key factors that the company has focused on.</p><p>"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux that are originally meant for Windows," engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," fellow engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games, and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games--all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library."</p><p>Griffais explained that developers also wanted to be assured that there would be an audience for their games to justify the effort spent on porting them, and that Valve worked on creating a machine that could reliably run games on it and offer an impressive layer of performance. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/">In another interview</a>, Griffais mentioned how Valve was aiming to make PC gaming "work better" in the living room, a space traditionally dominated by video game consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is currently scheduled to launch in 2026--alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">new Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR headset</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">but pricing for it has not yet been revealed</a>. Valve has said that it wants the Steam Machine to be "affordable," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-is-the-steam-machine-even-for-industry-expert-weighs-in/1100-6536186/">and one industry expert</a> believes that price "sweet spot" could be $400.</p>

Aim-assist is nothing new in Call of Duty (and many other games), but people are saying developer Treyarch went too far with the changes to aim-assist following the beta. Other people say it's great.</p><h2><strong>What Treyarch said about aim-assist changes</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Treyarch said its goal was to "create a more balanced and competitive experience for all players, regardless of input choice." Another important element for Treyarch was to "preserve the core feel of Call of Duty controller gameplay."</p><p>Based on feedback from the beta test, Treyarch said it learned that people playing on controllers have a slight advantage to win shootouts at close range. Keyboard and mouse setups, meanwhile, displayed a statistical advantage at long ranges.</p><p>Treyarch went on to say it also monitored player feedback on rotational aim-assist and made changes for launch based on that. "Based on the data and feedback, our launch adjustments focus on the strength of rotational aim-assist at short and long range, as well as the requirements to fully activate rotational aim-assist," Treyarch said.</p><h2><strong>What players are saying</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 players just getting started with the game have shared their opinions on the aim-assist changes online. Professional player <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/1988971829537697825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shotzzy</a> said, "I feel like I have no aim-assist. I'm not even trolling." Others have said it's the <a href="https://x.com/Follow_Henrique/status/1988953891422236768" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"dumbest decision"</a> to change aim-assist in this way. Other people have said <a href="https://x.com/xcellerations/status/1989101650523636131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dialing back aim-assist in this way shows how good you really are at Call of Duty</a>, and that can be humbling. A lot of people are <a href="https://x.com/PhantXmBLXZE/status/1989261492454293781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enjoying and embracing the aim-assist changes</a>. As usual with any given topic on the internet, opinions are all over the place.</p><h2><strong>Could Treyarch change aim-assist?</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 is a live multiplayer game and Treyarch has the ability to make ongoing changes, and that could happen based on feedback. "We look forward to hearing your feedback on these changes, and we will be gathering more data to continue our push for a level and competitive playing field in Black Ops 7," Treyarch said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>
