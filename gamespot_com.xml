But one unique feature is how you calm down after supernatural encounters--by petting your feline companion in the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/steelkrill/status/2008940598359937438" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Steelkrill Studio shared a video of the inspiration for the in-game kitty. The short clip shows players encountering the cat in The 18th Attic, with a picture-in-picture video of the developer's own cat getting some friendly rubs in real life. Steelkrill added that the in-game feline can be customized.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/steelkrill/status/2008940598359937438" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">After almost 1 year of solo development, my horror game launches next month 👻<br>You hunt ghosts with a Polaroid camera and Instead of sanity pills… you pet your cat to heal 🐈<br>Bonus cat actor behind the scenes inside 👇 <a href="https://t.co/iuBjmooAKV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/iuBjmooAKV</a></p>  — Steelkrill 🔪🦐 | Horror Game Dev (@steelkrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/steelkrill/status/2008940598359937438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Along with keeping you sane in The 18th Attic, the cat companion will alert you of dangers, too.
