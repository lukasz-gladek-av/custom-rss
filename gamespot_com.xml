                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather.</p><p>The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new "Freeze" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters.</p><p>According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has "a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6." Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 1.1.3.0 Update Notes</h2><h3>Audio</h3><p>With this update, we’ve made a wide range of audio improvements, including a dedicated tuning pass on footsteps to make movement clearer, easier to locate, and more readable at different distances.</p><p>We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches. To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p>These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.</p><h2>Changelog</h2><h3>Players</h3><ul><li>Fixed a clipping issue when dragging a soldier on an inclined surface when being prone.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with character shoulders when jumping.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where fall damage wouldn’t be applied immediately after being revived.</li><li>Fixed snapping and aggressive camera movements when performing takedowns on prone enemies from specific angles.</li><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to use vaulting to avoid being roadkilled by an enemy vehicle coming at high speed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing controller haptic feedback to continue indefinitely when a reload was interrupted by swapping to another weapon or gadget.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing hit registration to fail when firing while making extremely rapid aim adjustments.

                <p>Cash is still the ultimate commodity in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/" data-ref-id="5000-532553">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>, and Rockstar Games has been known to go out of its way to entice players with in-game currency rewards... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-players-get-1-million-cash-just-for-logging-in-right-now/1100-6534169/" data-ref-id="1100-6534169">sometimes for just logging in</a>. Now, Rockstar is offering $500,000 in game currency to anyone who follows a simple request.</p><p>To earn the prize, all you have to do is link your Discord account to your Rockstar Games account. Just <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clicking on this link</a> will take you where you need to be.</p><p>If you need something to invest all of that cash in, GTA Online's next update--A Safehouse in the Hills--allows players to buy their own missions. A new trailer for that update dropped today, and it revealed the return of Michael De Santa, one of the leading characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. If the footage is any indication, Michael's retirement didn't fully take. Or perhaps he's just very passionate about keeping certain criminal affairs out of his upscale neighborhood.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJ-lT0sBhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/APJ-lT0sBhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get one of these mega mansions for yourself, players will have to strike a deal with the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises "sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology."</p><p>A Safehouse in the Hills will launch on December 10, and players who opt into a Prix Luxury Black Tier VIP from now through December 7 can grab an Ubermacht Revolter sports car at the Luxury Autos showroom. Players can also advance to the Gold Tier membership by finishing all three New Listings missions, which will reward users with a $1 million bonus of in-game cash, as well as a $2 million discount on one of the luxury estates being offered by Prix Luxury.</p><p>Earlier this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">Rockstar added GTA Online</a> to its GTA+ membership service. It's still unclear what will happen to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is released in November 2026, but at least one video game analyst has argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise.</p>
