                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games. There will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p>For years, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">has fought with Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">Google</a> in court for the right to expand the Epic Games Store on mobile. The company says that it grew Epic cross-platform accounts to 898 million users during 2024--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-store-sales-on-pc-reached-1-billion-in-2024/1100-6529505/" data-ref-id="1100-6529505">an increase of 94 million people</a>--and this stat includes accounts created through partner platforms and the Epic Games Store. Epic is following in the footsteps of its PC store by trying to attract users with free games.</p><p>Recently, two members of Epic's board of directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-justice-department-investigation-leads-to-board-members-leaving-epic-games/1100-6528567/" data-ref-id="1100-6528567">were forced to step down</a> by the US Justice Department because they were already members of Tencent's board, which the government considers a rival gaming company. Epic is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">suing an alleged cheater</a> whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has released a <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Switch OLED bundle</a> featuring one of the console's best exclusive games: Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The bundle costs $350--the same price as the Switch OLED on its own--so you're essentially getting a digital copy of Nintendo's superb side-scrolling platformer for free. Mario Wonder still regularly sells for its full $60 MSRP. As an added bonus, the bundle also comes with a 3-month Switch Online individual membership ($8 value).</p><p>The <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch OLED bundle</a> is available now at Best Buy. We expect other major retailers, with the exception of Amazon, to stock the bundle soon.</p><p>Nintendo typically only releases new Switch console variants or bundles during the holidays and alongside big game launches--such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Hyrule-Edition-with-Bonus-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Expansion-Pack%2F9822067437%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder%2F1100-6529632%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom-themed Switch Lite</a> that launched last year.

Wonder is as good of a first game as any. The 2023 platformer offers an imaginative spin on the classic Super Mario side-scroller formula. It introduces multiple new gameplay features, including Mario's Elephant power-up and Wonder Flowers, which dynamically alter your surroundings in fun and creative ways. It earned a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-a-badge-of-honor/1900-6418136/" data-ref-id="1900-6418136">Super Mario Bros.

                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms. The note also states that the developers want the game "to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318" data-ratio="1" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318"></a><figcaption>The complete message from Tales of the Shire developers Private Division and Wētā Workshop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg"></figure><p>There will be no epic quests or ring-tossing into Mount Doom in this game. Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures. Truthfully, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins--as well Sam, Pippin, and Merry--were always outliers among their people. Most of the Hobbits prefer to stay at home in the Shire.</p><p>This game will allow players to create their own Hobbit character, and put together a beautiful home for them. Players can also enjoy simple Hobbit tasks like farming, gardening, decorating, and trading for rare items with fellow residents of the Shire.</p><p>Tales of the Shire will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC . GameSpot had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-has-a-long-ways-to-go-if-it-wants-to-be-precious/1100-6526616/" data-ref-id="1100-6526616">a hands-on preview for Tales of the Shire</a> last year, which called it "charming" and praised its "good fundamentals," while also stressing the need for several quality-of-life improvements and more compelling gameplay. Hopefully the final version of the game will deliver those adjustments.</p>

Although there are a handful of crash fixes, there aren't many major issues at all in this patch, which Warhorse is calling Hotfix 1.1.2. Instead, the most exciting revision comes in The King's Gambit, where players can now keep the wine flowing for the king.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1imfa12/kcd2_cant_pick_up_white_wine_during_the_kings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, some players ran into an issue in The King's Gambit where the option to pour wine for the king disappears. When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-had-a-huge-weekend-on-steam-and-it-may-get-even-bigger/1100-6529355/" data-ref-id="1100-6529355">peaked at 250,000 concurrent users</a> on Steam. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-mods-are-coming-get-a-first-peek-with-henry-holding-a-fish/1100-6529434/" data-ref-id="1100-6529434">official mod support is coming</a> to the PC version of the game as well.</p><p>Players have also found entertaining details in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-a-secret-ending-you-only-see-if-youre-the-worst-person-ever/1100-6529439/" data-ref-id="1100-6529439">a hidden ending</a> that can only be achieved by letting the main character embrace all of his worst instincts.

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other. However, It Takes Two had cross-gen play, meaning that PS4 and PS5 players and Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players could play with each other as long as they were on the same platform family.</p><p>Split Fiction is only on current-gen consoles, so cross-gen play doesn't exist. However, Split Fiction now offers cross-play, meaning that PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S players can all play together. Cross-play requires both players to sign up for separate EA accounts each, which you can <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">make for free</a>.</p><p>Hazelight also has a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hazelight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a> with a channel called "Looking for Player" for those who want to play Split Fiction with but don't have anyone available to arrange game sessions.</p><p>Split Fiction launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.
