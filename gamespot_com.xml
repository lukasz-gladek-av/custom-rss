                <p dir="ltr">Great news if you're looking to complete your collection of physical Final Fantasy releases on Switch--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGBTNHF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX</a> Switch physical editions are finally launching in North America. These originally launched in Japan and Europe a few years ago, but US fans were stuck with digital versions on the eShop. While you could import and play the physical versions from other regions thanks to the Switch's region-free hardware, these new US releases will (hopefully) be easier to find when they launch on December 9. Preorders for both games are now live at Amazon for $40 each. While there are no preorder bonuses announced at this time, it's still worth securing early copies, since physical Final Fantasy Switch releases tend to be very popular.</p><p dir="ltr">All three games offer the same core experience as the original PS1 RPGs, but with HD graphics and higher resolution presentation. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered in particular features new character models that are more detailed than the PS1's--though they still resemble the PS1's 3D models' art direction, and use the original animations, so it's not a <em>huge</em> change. All three games also feature optional toggles to turn off random encounters, make your characters invincible, and more. While these are Switch games, you can of course play them on Switch 2 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">With these new Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack and Final Fantasy IX physical releases, it's now possible to grab physical editions of almost every mainline Final Fantasy game--plus some of its best spinoffs--on Switch. The first six entries in the series are all included in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a>, and the Switch version is on sale for $69 (was $75). Though if you're looking for the best deal, it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available on PS4</a> for just $53. The pixel remaster versions of these games maintain the classic 2D gameplay of the NES and SNES RPGs, but feature new pixel art (and not the ugly redrawn sprites of the mobile re-releases from a few years ago), as well as other tweaks like the ability to play with the original chiptune soundtracks or new orchestrated versions, optional battle speed and difficulty settings, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For the later entries in the series, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster</a>, which includes Final Fantasy X and its sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. These versions feature upscaled graphics, orchestrated soundtracks, and the extra content from the International Editions of both games, including the roguelike mystery dungeon-style bonus game FFX-2: Last Mission. The CG short Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm--which bridges X and X-2--and the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will are also included in the collection. The Switch edition is on sale for just $25 (was $50).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is available on Nintendo's handhelds via the Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age edition. This re-release of the PS2 RPG includes similar features as many of the other Final Fantasy remasters, including upscaled graphics, a re-recorded soundtrack, and battlespeed modifiers, plus all the bonus content and gameplay changes from the PS2's International Edition that was left out of the US release--including the excellent new Job System that adds welcome variety to how you build your party. You can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age on Switch</a> for $25 (was $50). Both Final Fantasy X/X2 HD and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age are being sold and shipped by Amazon, which we assume means Square Enix recently reprinted both games, since previously it was only available from third-party sellers. It's also surprising that both games are just $25, given that the eShop versions are $50 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, the fictional world created by the beloved spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics, which recently saw its own high-quality remaster in the form of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. This version includes the option to play with the original PS1 graphics, or the newly remastered version with higher resolution graphics, voice-acted dialog, an overhauled UI, and other changes. The Switch version is available in a $50 Amazon-exclusive physical edition that includes the game and a bonus fold-out poster, as well as a free Switch 2 Upgrade.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Physical Final Fantasy Switch and Switch 2 Games</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Switch)</a> -- $69 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX HD (Switch)</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Amazon Exclusive Edition (Switch)</a> -- $50 | Switch 2 upgrade included</li></ul><p dir="ltr">That leaves Final Fantasy XI Online, Final Fantasy XIV Online, the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, Final Fantasy XV, and Final Fantasy XVI as the last numbered entries in the series not playable on Nintendo's handhelds. We wouldn't be surprised to see most of those show up on Switch 2 eventually (except for FFXI Online since it's a 20-year-old MMORPG that is only playable on PC these days)--though if you're looking to play a version of XV on Nintendo's handhelds, the Final Fantasy XV Mobile version--which is an episodic reimagining that heavily chops down the original PS4 open-world RPG and features a cartoonish art style--is available on the eShop. You'll also find other Final Fantasy spin-offs like World of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles HD, and Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon on the eShop as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the Switch 2 still has some big Final Fantasy releases headed its way. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</a> launches on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and preorders are available for $50 at Amazon.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Ever since Ghostface appeared in Call of Duty years ago, I've been impatiently waiting for my favorite horror icon to arrive in my favorite multiplayer game. I knew it was just a matter of time, and thankfully that time is now. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnitemares-2025-all-skins-weapons-and-new-map/2900-7125/" data-ref-id="2900-7125">Fortnitemares 2025</a> adds Ghostface among so many other crossovers, like Scooby-Doo, Terrifier's Art the Clown, indie horror hits REPO and Poppy Playtime, and more, to Fortnite. But not all of these collabs got the same treatment, and even cooler than the upcoming Ghostface skin is the new Scream-inspired weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">In Fortnite's latest Halloween event, you can find the new Last Call weapon inspired by Scream's legendary slasher. The weapon is more like a set of features; it's a knife with attached movement abilities, voice lines, and, when equipped, a full Ghostface costume. Unlike the Scooby Snacks or Doja Cat's Thorn Ripper, which are both fun but also reskins of pre-existing items, the Last Call isn't quite like anything the game has included before, and as a huge fan of Scream, I think Epic absolutely nailed the design.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582880"></a><figcaption>The slasher GOAT arrives in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First, there's how you acquire it. You can't pick up the Last Call knife in chests or find it as floor loot. Instead, you have to visit a phone booth. Stepping into the phone booth briefly, you emerge dressed as Ghostface, and you'll switch out of the all-black costume and iconic white mask whenever you unequip the knife, which taps into Scream's long list of killers claiming the role of Ghostface over the years.</p><p dir="ltr">It was pretty funny, I admit, when I was already playing as Michael Myers and switched between Carpenter and Craven with the press of a button, but I love how this subtle aesthetic choice captures an important facet of the Scream series--not to mention it gives some folks the chance to run around as Ghostface even if they haven't bought the skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, there are the Last Call's special features. While wielding it, you'll run faster. Speed has always been something that separates Ghostface from most other slashers. Where the likes of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slowly walk toward their prey--and that can be scary in its own right, no doubt--Ghostface sprints. Epic was wise to pair the knife with the movement speed buff to really capture the killer's vibe.</p><p dir="ltr">The finishing touch that I adore is the phone call element tied to the item. The knife includes an ability to "call" others on the map, which in gameplay terms plays out as pinging anyone within the item's radius whenever you use the ability between cooldowns. A phone ringing is the first thing we ever hear in the Scream series, and the voice of Roger L. Jackson taunting victims about their favorite scary movies and stalking them while in hiding is as integral to the series as the mask itself.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:f7h45eshrvbthfo3l445uej7/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2rxomnvss2u" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiabv53ovjynfsyhimakdgwgqvwndvju6j3jvyzyiu5lodn36zialq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>Fortnite’s Ghostface weapon, the Last Call knife, includes a costume switch, a phone that calls and pings nearby enemies, faster movement, and voice lines (a bit buried here beneath pumpkin launcher noises).

  </div><p dir="ltr">In Fortnite, each time you pick up the knife from a phone booth, you'll hear Ghostface--and it does seem to be Jackson reprising his role--bark out a voice line. When you successfully ping someone nearby with the calling ability, he'll speak again. I've heard several different phrases in just a few rounds with the Last Call. These features give the knife a role-playing element thanks to how each aspect taps into the character's almost 30-year history.</p><p dir="ltr">Being such a big Scream fan, I'm already making a point to not just grab a Last Call every round, but I've even been playing with just this knife (and some movement items and heals, of course). Sure, Ghostface briefly uses a shotgun in Scream 6, but I'm having a blast role-playing as my favorite horror movie's starring villain in my knife-only matches. There's even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnitemares-quests-2025-how-to-get-a-free-fortnite-skin-and-all-rewards/1100-6535338/" data-ref-id="1100-6535338">Fortnitemares quest</a> to use it on seven different players.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic consistently adds cool, inventive new items to Fortnite every season, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised how awesome the Ghostface crossover has become, but <em>this </em>level of thoughtfulness in the design of a weapon has often been reserved for the many major Star Wars and Marvel collabs. As someone who doesn't feel anything for those series, but who loves Scream so much that I have a Ghostface tattoo, it's so exciting to be on the receiving end of Fortnite's latest extra-mile effort.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Up until now, every character confirmed to appear in Invincible Vs--the 3v3 tag fighter starring characters from Skybound's Invincible series--has been a souped-up superhero. Today, at New York Comic Con, Skybound and developer Quarter Up changed that, as Global Defense Agency head Cecil Stedman has officially been added to the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Designing a human character to fight against superhuman opponents on the level of Omni-Man and Invincible requires a change of approach. GameSpot sat down with Robert Kirkman, creator of Invincible, and multiple members of the dev team at Quarter Up to speak about the process of bringing Cecil and his unique abilities to the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS. - Cecil Stedman Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">"Only" human</h2><p dir="ltr">As a "normal" human among superheroes, Cecil relies less on superior strength and speed, and more on the vast resources of his government agency to provide extra firepower. This idea was key to Cecil's appearance in Invincible Vs, as it's those resources that make him a very formidable foe.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not saying he has endless funds, but he's using a lot of taxpayer money to get around," executive producer Mike Willette said. "He can jump around and teleport because, while he's just a regular guy and doesn't have the mobility of double jumps and flight like other characters, with government funds, he can get around just fine."</p><p dir="ltr">That movement allows Cecil to manipulate the arena to his advantage, which Willette says plays into the character's role as a master manipulator. "He has projectiles with ranged arcs, he has a sonic mine that will hover before it detonates, he has a lot of ranged utility," Willette said. "He can fill the screen, almost like a bullet hell, and as soon as he confirms a hit, he flows right back into our combo system."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just the moveset that proves challenging when adding a human like Cecil to a roster of superhumans; he has to <em>look</em> like he can hold his own against the rest of the roster. Skybound art director Dan Eder explained how the team found different ways to truly bring out Cecil's power.</p><p dir="ltr">"We asked ourselves, how do we still make him someone imposing without all the muscle mass of a huge bulky dude like Omni-Man?" Eder said. "We do lean more towards the show, but we go through so many iterations with every new character that I think the artistic process here is very challenging but also extremely satisfying. Ultimately, I think it feels very authentic to the character, and he's going to feel cohesive within the rest of the roster, even though they are visually pretty different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740"></a><figcaption>Cecil Stedman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582741,1300-4582742,1300-4582743,1300-4582744,1300-4582746,1300-4582747,1300-4582748,1300-4582749" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Fitting into the canon</h2><p dir="ltr">The addition of Cecil also came with the news of an original story arc that will be told within Invincible VS. Though the team didn't give specifics on where exactly the game fits into the overall timeline, Robert Kirkman said that the teams at Skybound and Quarter Up closely collaborated to make sure this story felt natural to the series as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Narrative director] Mike [Rogers] has been working really closely with Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the Invincible series, and co-wrote the Atom Eve game with me," Kirkman confirmed. "There's logic to where the story mode for this game would fit in the narrative of the Invincible show, and while we're not talking specifics here today, fans of The Invincible television show are going to get a very cool experience that's tailored to fit within that narrative."</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers himself likens the Invincible Vs story as a "standalone special" to the overarching Invincible storyline. "It's been a real treat going to work with Helen and Robert," Rogers said, "and really make this feel authentic to the Invincible universe."</p><p dir="ltr">Where Atom Eve was a narrative adventure game focused on Atom Eve, the Invincible Vs story gave the narrative team a lot more to play with in terms of available characters. For Kirkman, the ability to use these characters in new ways is a big part of what makes a project like this so enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it's cool because it's a bigger playground for them to play in," Kirkman said. "The interaction of these characters is, at times, somewhat unique to the universe. There are characters in this game's story, who interact with one another, that haven't really interacted very much before in other forms of Invincible."</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Cecil joins a cast of playable characters that also includes Omni-Man, Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode, Bulletproof, Thula, and Battle Beast.</p>

                <p>A 17-year veteran on the Halo development team has left the company, posting an ominous-sounding message on the way out.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glenn Israel said on LinkedIn</a> that he is "no longer contributing to the Halo universe" after working on the sci-fi series since 2008. Israel got his start on the Halo franchise at Bungie before joining 343 Industries--now known as Halo Studios--as art director.</p><p>Israel said in his post that there is "little more I can say for the moment" about the nature of his exit from the Halo development team. He added, "I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year."</p><p>He also shared a message for others in the games industry, a business that's facing "dire" times of late. "No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics, or values--and no one can force you to," he said. "Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on this situation and Israel's exit from Halo Studios.

Many are expecting Microsoft's announcement this month to be something related to the next Halo game(s).</p><p>2021's Halo Infinite is the latest entry in the main series. Microsoft has made major changes to the franchise and its studios since then, including installing a new executive leadership team and switching game engines for future projects, while acknowledging that Halo Infinite missed the mark in some respects.

The game comes packed with a full campaign, collectibles to hunt down, and plenty of achievements to earn. Below, we'll break down the mission list and all of the side objectives you might want to tackle during your playthrough of Battlefield 6's story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Battlefield 6 - Campaign length and missions</h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 has a total of nine campaign missions. On average, it should take you around 4-5 hours to complete the campaign on the normal difficulty level. Of course, you can take your time to explore the map, hunt down collectibles, and attempt the game's specific achievement/trophy requirements. A harder difficulty could lead to slower mission progression, naturally.</p>
