                <p>Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has discussed the possibility of Johnny Silverhand actor Keanu Reeves returning to the character, asking The Matrix star to get on the phone and call him.</p><p>Appearing in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDstreams broadcast</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/contact-me-cyberpunk-creator-mike-pondsmith-tells-keanu-reeves-he-has-ways-to-bring-johnny-silverhand-back-from-the-dead-for-cyberpunk-2?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>, Pondsmith said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-would-come-back-for-cyberpunk-2/1100-6534536/" data-ref-id="1100-6534536">saw the headlines</a> where Reeves himself said he would be keen to come back to play Silverhand again in a future Cyberpunk project, whether that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> or something else.</p><p>"I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me," Pondsmith said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIcTM8WXFjk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qIcTM8WXFjk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Silverhand is a former rockstar who appears in the game in the form of a digital engram long after his physical body dies. The character's fate at the end of Cyberpunk 2077 can depend on the ending that players receive. Given that, it appears possible that he could return in Cyberpunk 2, but that's far from a guarantee that it would happen, as that would depend on a countless combination of factors.</p><p>Pondsmith also discussed how maybe it could be possible for yet another celebrity to appear in a Cyberpunk project, following on from Reeves and Idris Elba, who played Solomon Reed in the popular Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty.</p><p>"What's next? Scarlett Johansson?" Pondsmith said. "Scarlett, you know, I have roles for you. You can do anything."</p><p>There is no release date set as of yet for Cyberpunk 2, but no one should expect it soon. As for CD Projekt's other upcoming games, the company is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> and is co-producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher game</a> with developer Fool's Theory.</p>

                <p>Without the Witcher novels by Andrezj Sapkowski, there wold be no hit series on Netlflix or even the video games that revitalized the property a decade ago. According to Sapkowski, he's happy with his arrangements with CD Projekt Red, even though the devs don't ask him many questions anymore.</p><p>While promoting his latest novel (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Sapkowski noted that CD Projekt Red used to approach him about additional info about the characters and the world he created. Now, he says it's "so rare" for CD Projekt Red to ask him any advice.</p><p>When Sapkowski originally signed withe CD Projekt Red to let them adapt his novels, he took an upfront payment instead of royalties. Sapkowski subsequently sued the developer to get a better deal after the blockbuster success of The Witcher 3. Terms weren't disclosed, but the case was settled. Now, Sapokowski describes his relationship with the devs in more glowing terms.</p><p>"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now," said Sapokowski. "Let's hope it stays that way."</p><p>Netflix recently debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt-in-new-witcher-season-4-trailer/1100-6535277/" data-ref-id="1100-6535277">The Witcher Season 4</a>, which will have a fifth and final season to wrap up the show. Meanwhile CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into active development last year. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a>, and it looked impressive. However, the developers subsequently described the demo as a technical demonstration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">rather than a preview of the game itself</a>, which doesn't currently have a release date. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also expected to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">one final patch in 2026</a> that will enable mod access on consoles.</p>

                <p>Video game remakes and remasters have attracted impressive player numbers and generated substantial consumer spending, research shows, although full-on remakes may have a slight edge.</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis tracked data from January 2024 to September 2025, looking at 42 re-releases (specifically, 15 remakes and 27 remasters). These releases accumulated 72.4 million players across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with consumers spending $1.4 billion from purchasing these games and related in-game monetisation.</p><p>Overall, the average remake produced 2.2 times the amount of consumer spending as remasters did during that time frame. For instance, while the Gears of War: Reloaded remaster had a similar peak monthly active user count as the Silent Hill 2 remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the latter two titles far surpassed Gears of War in consumer spending.</p><p>The one outlier is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which peaked at $180 million in consumer spending and pulled in 7 million monthly active users, far and above every other remaster and remake included in the study.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The data goes to show the power of a popular IP like The Elder Scrolls, even though overall, remakes resulted in higher consumer spending and player engagement. This research also highlights the differences between remasters and remakes, both of which are prevalent strategies employed by major game publishers.</p><p>While remakes might yield greater returns and player counts, they are more costly and take longer to develop, as they are built from the ground up. A benefit of remakes is that core gameplay can be completely refigured to be up-to-date with modern sensibilities. Remasters, on the other hand, are typically fresh coats of paint on existing assets and systems, requiring less time and fewer resources; however, outdated gameplay design may still be evident.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-finds-nearly-all-gamers-have-played-a-remaster-or-remake-in-last-year/1100-6534807/" data-ref-id="1100-6534807">separate report in September</a> showed that the vast majority of people who play video games have engaged with remakes or remasters, with most of them not even playing the original version of the game.</p><p>It's hard to throw a dart at a release schedule and not hit a re-release, with just this year's schedule including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">remakes of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-remake-review/1900-6418433/" data-ref-id="1900-6418433">first two Dragon Quest games</a>, along with remasters of Donkey Kong Country Returns and several Tomb Raider games.</p><p>This study from Ampere Analytics has some interesting data to chew on--it'll be interesting to see where the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-saw-every-asset-get-attention-to-bring-it-up-to-modern-standards/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">remakes of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/" data-ref-id="1100-6531547">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would fall on that graphic.</p>
