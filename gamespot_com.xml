                <p>Nintendo is expanding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s slim GameCube library with another classic next week. The beloved arcade soccer game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-strikers/" data-ref-id="5000-24383">Super Mario Strikers</a> will join the lineup on July 3.</p><p>Originally released in 2005, Super Mario Strikers is a fast-paced soccer game starring an assortment of iconic Mario characters. Like other Mario sports titles, the game features numerous arcade elements, including items like banana peels that can be used to trip up your opponent, as well as powerful special shots that are worth two goals if successfully executed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VOcz6Z5PRY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Super Mario Strikers would go on to spawn two sequels. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-charged/" data-ref-id="5000-28061">Mario Strikers Charged</a> launched for the Wii in 2007, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-battle-league/" data-ref-id="5000-557731">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> was released on the Switch back in 2022.</p><p>With the addition of Super Mario Strikers, Switch Online's GameCube library spans four games so far. Nintendo has already confirmed that more classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-sunshine/" data-ref-id="5000-3885">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-colosseum/" data-ref-id="5000-18350">Pokemon Colosseum</a> are coming to the service in the future.</p><p>The GameCube library is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan. In addition, subscribers can download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free, although it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-upgrade-process-is-mildly-confusing-for-nso-members/1100-6532137/" data-ref-id="1100-6532137">may not be immediately clear how</a>.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Another perk of the Switch Online service is Switch 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">GameChat</a> function, which allows users to chat and share their screen with friends. The feature is free to try for all Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026 as part of an open-access trial period, after which point you'll need to have a Switch Online subscription to use it.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-634330">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>, also known as Resident Evil 9, stars Grace Ashcroft, the presumed daughter of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-outbreak/" data-ref-id="5000-4247">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft. The decision to cast a new character in the lead role isn't unheard of for Resident Evil--the last two games have starred Ethan Winters, who was also new at the time. However, fans of the series might've expected a familiar face, such as Leon S. Kennedy, to reappear as the playable character. During the Capcom Showcase for June 2025, the developer-publisher explained why Leon, specifically, isn't a good fit for Requiem.</p><p>"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLYYnkbg-F_/?igsh=bjNyazdqd280c29p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a developer said during the showcase</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror." Grace, meanwhile, is said to be an FBI analyst who is trained with guns but must learn to overcome some of her fears over the course of the game's story, as she's initially "introverted and easily scared."</p><p>Leon has previously starred in three mainline Resident Evil entries: Resident Evil 2, alongside Claire Redfield, Resident Evil 4--often lauded as the series' best entry--and Resident Evil 6 as one of multiple playable characters. He's appeared in several other offshoots throughout Resident Evil's history, too, such as ReVerse and Operation Raccoon City, and is widely regarded as one of the most prominent figures in the franchise.</p><p>It's unclear what role, if any, Leon may play in Resident Evil: Requiem, though Capcom tends to thrust its famous faces into its stories even when they aren't the protagonist or playable character. Chris Redfield, for example, plays an important role in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-village/" data-ref-id="5000-513797">Resident Evil: Village</a>.</p><p>If only Leon weren't so hunky and valiant, he may appear once more as the central figure in one of Capcom's more horror-centric entries like next February's Requiem.</p>

                <p>Monster Hunter Wilds next free content update is adding two new monsters, Lagiacrus and Seregios, along with underwater combat and layered weapons.</p><p>Announced during the Capcom Spotlight showcase, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 arrives on June 30, and it is adding a ton of new content to the game. The biggest new additions here are the two monsters, both of which are returning favorites from previous games. Lagiacrus is a sea wyvern, preferring a water habitat. While Capcom's trailer depicted it fighting on land, it also included underwater combat sections, as well. Meanwhile, Seregios is a medium-sized wyvern with bright gold scales. Both of those monsters will be available on June 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242"></a><figcaption>The new monsters will be available on June 30, with other features rolling out later.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Capcom also ran down the schedule of new content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds throughout the summer. On June 30, the next wave of cosmetic DLC will arrive, adding new layered armor and emotes. Late July will see the release of the next tempered monster, Arch Temper Uth Duna. Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a summer-themed event with new cosmetics and event quests, runs from July 23 to August 6. On August 27, Capcom is releasing a new emote in collaboration with Fender guitars. Capcom concluded by revealing that Title Update 3, which will add another monster, will arrive in late September.</p><p>The update also adds a number of small quality-of-life features, like layered weapons and improved photo mode options, like new lighting options. Unfortunately for PC players, Capcom made no mention of Monster Hunter Wilds' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/" data-ref-id="1100-6532587">ongoing performance issues</a>, like inconsistent frame rates and the game not booting for some players after an update.</p>
