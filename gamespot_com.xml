                <p>2019's beloved RPG Disco Elysium is headed to a new platform: mobile. Developer ZA/UM Studio has announced that the game is being "reimagined" for mobile, and specifically Android devices. This game was announced amid <a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" data-target="true">legal disagreements</a> between some of the developers of the original game.</p><p>The developer said it's making an "entirely fresh experience tailored for mobile gamers." In a press release, the studio said the game is a "total re-imagination" of the psychological RPG. What that means is the mobile edition has been created with short play sessions in mind. Check out a trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbN8Nf8s8mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lbN8Nf8s8mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It's what audiobooks wish they were," narrative leader Chris Priestman said of the game's mobile edition. As you can see in the trailer, the mobile version of Disco Elysium has "360-degree scenes" that aim to immerse players more. There is also "brand-new audio" with full voiceover.</p><p>Studio head Denis Havel, who worked on the original game, said "mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences like Disco Elysium." Havel added that the team aimed for the mobile version to have "profound respect for the original's artistry and meaning."</p><p>The first two chapters of Disco Elysium on mobile are free, and players can then pay to unlock the rest of the game's chapters with a single purchase. There are no ads.</p><p>You can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-register for Disco Elysium now from Google Play</a>. The game is expected to launch in Summer 2025. Anyone attending GDC 2025 next week can play Disco Elysium on mobile at Google's booth. There is no word yet on a potential release for iOS.</p><p>A proper Disco Elysium sequel was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-expansion-and-sequel-canceled-report/1100-6521118/" data-ref-id="1100-6521118">canceled</a>. In the wake of that, some developers who were going to make the sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-devs-form-new-studio-currently-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-to-the-beloved-rpg/1100-6527108/" data-ref-id="1100-6527108">split off to create Longdue Games and are now making a spiritual successor.</a> As for ZA/UM, the studio is also making a new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/" data-ref-id="1100-6530033">a spy-thriller in the works under the name Project C4.</a></p>

                <p>Ubisoft has unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-285282">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, and alongside that a new permanent game mode coming to the shooter, Dual Front. Dual Front is a 6v6 game mode featuring respawns, but it still preserves the tactical elements that Siege is known for.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front takes place on a single large map, split into two lanes heading from one team's base to the other. Each lane consists of two sectors, which teams will have to capture one at a time by planting sabotage devices, similar to planting bombs in the main game mode. The two biggest differences here are that each team has six players and that teams will need to manage both attacking the new enemy sector while still defending their own. Teams can split up however they like, and after dying you have a roughly 30-second timer before you can get back in the fight. There is also a neutral zone in the middle where optional objectives, like escorting a hostage to a helicopter, appear, granting a bonus to the team that successfully completes it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873"></a><figcaption>Dual Front takes place in a large industrial area, with smaller areas like a Gas Station making up the sectors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another big difference is the operator pool. There is a limited number of operators in the pool, 35 at launch, which will get rotated on a regular basis. The pool contains both attackers and defenders, which you can pick from freely. This means you can grab a defense-focused operator and go on the attack or vice versa, creating new strategic ways to try and win a match. Matches are expected to take around 20-25 minutes, and there is a timer automatically ending a match at 30 minutes. When Siege X launches, there will be one map featuring symmetrical lanes, but Ubisoft plans on updating and changing the map each season.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-closed-beta-starts-today-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530117/" data-ref-id="1100-6530117">Dual Front closed beta begins today</a>, and you can sign up now.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front is just one of the many new features coming to Rainbow Six Siege X when it launches on June 10 as part of Y10 S2 of the multiplayer shooter.</p>
