                <p>In an unexpected statement today, Activision made a dramatic announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">no longer allow</a> players to transfer any Black Ops 6 characters, weapons, or skins to Black Ops 7. Many are taking this as a sign that Activision doesn't want Black Ops 7 to be overrun with the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for against a backdrop where competitor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> will only include "grounded" cosmetics.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision said it is aware of the "conversation" happening online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and the perception from some that it's "drifted" away from its identity.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," the company said.</p><p>Activision added that Black Ops 7 developers Treyarch and Raven have been guided by the goal of making a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while at the same time "taking some big swings."</p><p>The company had previously said Black Ops 7 would included the franchise's Carry Forward feature that allows content from the past game to move forward to the next one. However, Black Ops 7 is doing away with this, and now, operators, skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p><p>"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the developer said. This only applies to Black Ops 7, as previous content will continue to carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement not long after Battlefield 6's big reveal, during which developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>The Call of Duty in-game store no doubt is a big-time money-maker, fueled in part by the kind of outlandish skins previous games have offered. It remains to be seen what kind of extra cosmetic content Activision will up-sell in Black Ops 7, or if the statement today will have any bearing on that.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta</a> begins in October. </p>

                <p>In 2021, Marvel Studios attempted to expand the reach of the MCU with an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">Eternals</a>, a lesser-known group of immortal heroes. Kumail Nanjiani was cast as Kingo alongside Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and more. Eternals didn't earn enough to merit a sequel, and Nanjiani has revealed that he had a deal for a video game and a theme park attraction that never came to pass.</p><p>"I signed on for six movies, you know," said Nanjiani during his appearance on Mike Birbiglia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Y8zwAj3sYpc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working It Out</a> podcast. "I signed on for a video game. I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign up for all this stuff ... And so you're like, 'Oh, this is the next 10 years of my life, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and then in-between I'll do like my own little things, whatever I want to do.' And then none of that happened."</p><p>That deal appears to have been predicated on Eternals being a hit like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which did get licensed out for video games and theme park rides. Marvel hasn't had a lot of video games based directly on the MCU movies in the last two decades, but the studio apparently kept the possibility open for Eternals.</p><p>Nanjiani previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-went-to-therapy-after-bad-reviews/1100-6520870/" data-ref-id="1100-6520870">disclosed that he went to therapy</a> after Eternals was greeted with bad reviews, but he told Birbiglia that the experience taught him that too much of his self esteem was tied up to other people's reactions to his work.</p><p>Eternals had $402.1 million worldwide, which is a threshold that Marvel Studios has had trouble reaching this year. Regardless, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-brings-adamantium-finally-references-eternals/1100-6525358/" data-ref-id="1100-6525358">the only Marvel movie to pick up on some of the threads introduced in Eternals</a> was Captain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Nanjiani also noted that he's proud of Eternals, and his experience with it has given him material for his latest standup comedy set.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there."</p><p>Activision said double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward. "Because we recognize your time and progression are important," the developer explained.</p><p>Only a week ago, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-carry-forward-returns-for-black-ops-7-but-with-limitations/1100-6534013/" data-ref-id="1100-6534013">the Carry Forward program would return for Black Ops 7</a>, but not until some time after Season 1. The company said at the time there would be some exceptions, but now, it's not happening at all.</p><h2><b>The identity of Call of Duty has "drifted"</b></h2><p>In the statement today, Activision also acknowledged the conversations online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and how the perception from some is that Call of Duty has "drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place."</p><p>Activision said it understands that people want Call of Duty to be and feel "immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded."</p><p>"That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," Activision said.</p><p>The company did not, however, say what it's doing to address this beyond cancelling the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7. It appears Activision could be referencing the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for in recent years. Some part of the Call of Duty audience enjoys and embraces these skins, and others have said they are a detriment to the overall experience.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 backdrop</strong></h2><p>Activision is making these comments against the backdrop of Battlefield 6's release in October. Battlefield Studios has said it wants the game's multiplayer skins to feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-have-grounded-skins-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj/1100-6533627/" data-ref-id="1100-6533627">"grounded."</a></p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." That is seemingly a reference to the DLC skin for Call of Duty that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">lets you play as Minaj.</a> Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, producer Alexia Christofi said much the same thing, explaining that Battlefield Studios is hoping to make Battlefield 6's skins "feel grounded."</p><p>"We want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like, 'I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin,'" Christofi said. "But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. You can find highlights of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">new Black Ops 7 announcements</a> here, which includes details on an endgame for the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic look for multiplayer.</p>
