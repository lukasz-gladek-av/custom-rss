          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpg-ps5/2900-6701/" data-ref-id="2900-6701">best RPGs on PS5</a> will soon be available in a convenient new bundle, as the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Rebirth Twin Pack Physical Edition</a> is set to arrive on December 4. Its name is a mouthful, but it's shaping up to be the easiest way for players to catch up on the first two entries in the planned trilogy. It's only releasing for PS5, but preorders should be opening soon--and we're expecting the twin pack to be quite popular.</p><p>There are a few caveats with this cool bundle. For one, there's some confusion with its release date and preorders. The official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-physical-edition-now-available-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix blog</a> says the Twin Pack is "now available," while its <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1976271756118868009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> accounts claim it's dropping on December 4. The latter is clearly the correct date, but unfortunately, no preorders have opened. Folks in the UK and Europe might have some luck on the Square Enix Store, but the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">link</a> for North America currently leads to a lovely 404 error.</p><p>At any rate, we're hoping to see it at additional retailers in the future, though no plans have been made official by Square Enix. It's also unclear if it'll eventually launch on platforms beyond PS5. The trilogy has been confirmed to arrive on Switch and Xbox (starting with Remake Intergrade on January 22), but there's no mention as to whether this Twin Pack is included in the multiplatform plans. Hopefully things become clearer as we get closer to its December 4 release.</p><p>Can't wait until December to dive in? You can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> for $40 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rebirth</a> for $50 at Amazon. The latter comes with an Amazon-exclusive Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PS5 controller skin, featuring both Cloud and Sephiroth.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-big-deal-days-best-movie-deals-4k-blu-rays-available-now/1100-6535093/">Grab 4K Blu-Rays For Under $13: Inception, The Shining, Blade Runner, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-movie-4k-blu-ray-special-edition-steelbook-the-film-vault/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New Numbered Limited Edition Is Up For Grabs At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>A new video with PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP Jack Huynh has shed more light on the technology that could potentially power the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">yet-to-be-announced PlayStation 6 console</a>. AMD and Sony have been collaborating through Project Amethyst, an initiative designed to push gaming technology forward, and Cerny added that he's really excited to bring recent breakthroughs to a "future console."</p><h3>Expect a "game-changer" in future upscaling technologies</h3><p>According to Cerny and Huyn, there have been three big developments recently. Cerny explained that current technologies like FSR and PSSR are extremely demanding on GPUs and system memory. The first new concept revealed was Neural Arrays, which Hyung explained was designed to overcome inefficiencies encountered by subdividing neural network problems across many compute units. Neural Arrays allow compute units to "team up" and share data, and the end result here is that this can lead to better FSR and ray tracing effects, more efficiency, and better scalability as a workload grows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LCMzw-_dMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Neural Arrays will allow us to process a large chunk of the screen in one go, and the efficiencies that come from that are going to be a game-changer as we begin to develop the next generation of upscaling and denoising technologies together," Cerny explained.</p><p>Cerny and Hyung also expect ray tracing to improve through the use of Neural Radiance Caching--which was unveiled at Computex earlier this year--and Radiance Cores. Together, ray tracing and path tracing can be handled together in real time, allowing developers to access a new level of realistic lighting while also allowing the CPU to focus on geometry and simulation tasks. "A cleaner, faster, and more efficient pipeline built for the next generation of ray-traced games," Huynh said.</p><p>The other big reveal was Universal Compression, a new system designed for future GPUs and software-on-chips as a way to dramatically reduce memory bandwidth usage. This is an expansion of current technologies utilized on PS5 and PS5 Pro, and Universal Compression will evaluate and compress every piece of data on its way to the system memory. This will then lead to lower power consumption, higher visual quality, and improved performance.</p><p>"It's still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years' time," Cerny concluded.</p><p>This year will mark the fifth anniversary of the PS5's launch, but there have been a few hints from Sony regarding its plans for a successor console. O<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">ne proposed idea is a detachable disc drive</a>, giving the rumored console a layer of modularity. We also know that Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a>, as it's aware that its users prefer the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software directly downloaded to the system.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Say hello to Anime Village Online, a new game set for 2027 that has <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10017289" rel="nofollow ">a PSN listing</a>. Coming from developer GamePoc, the title has some striking similarities to Nintendo's Animal Crossing franchise. The notable resemblance includes the character design (especially the eyes), the game's name, as well as the fact that it's built around decorating, fishing, and growing crops.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://gamepoc.com/#about_us" rel="nofollow ">GamePoc</a> hasn't released a game before, but the developer also has a listing for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016122/" rel="nofollow ">Rooted: Survival</a> that features imagery that looks a great deal like The Last of Us. GameSpot reached out to GamePoc CEO Wisnu Sudirman about these projects; Sudirman responded that both games are real.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4582665-86a62950e649b6773c650654195ce68f11e9a3c4b3e7e12a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4582665-86a62950e649b6773c650654195ce68f11e9a3c4b3e7e12a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582665"></a><figcaption>The PlayStation Store features this screenshot for Anime Village Online, which bears similarities to Nintendo's Animal Crossing franchise.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4582665-86a62950e649b6773c650654195ce68f11e9a3c4b3e7e12a.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Regarding the similarities mentioned: While it's true that Rooted: Survival shares post-apocalyptic themes like zombies and survival elements, which are also found in The Last of Us, and Anime Village Online may evoke a life-simulation vibe similar to Animal Crossing, our games are built with distinct goals and mechanics in mind," Sudirman said in an email.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our primary focus is on online cooperative multiplayer, encouraging players to connect, collaborate, and enjoy unique experiences together. We believe this differentiates our games significantly from the franchises mentioned."</p><p dir="ltr">Anime Village Online is stated as having "true cross-platform multiplayer," but there isn't a listing for the game on other storefronts. However, GamePoc does have two other games on the way. Orbital Station Simulator has a May 2026 release window <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015557/" rel="nofollow ">on PSN</a>, while Cyberpunk Fighter has a general TBA release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1483830/Cyberpunk_Fighter/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. None of these titles are available to buy. </p><p dir="ltr">Copycat games are not a new phenomenon. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-rip-off-game-on-switch-taken-down-trailers-copyright-claimed-by-sony/1100-6516451/">The Last of Us rip-off called The Last Hope - Dead Zone Revival was removed</a> from the Switch eShop. However, the game was never available in North America.</p>
