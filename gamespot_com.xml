                <p>We're getting a blast from the past when a future major Call of Duty: Warzone update drops in Spring 2026. "A bold new experience" will come to the battle royale, inspired by the Black Ops 4 battle royale mode, Blackout.</p><p>"Call of Duty: Warzone is bringing a bold new experience in Spring of 2026 inspired by the original Blackout, set on Avalon," reads a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post </a>from the official Call of Duty X account.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 was the first Call of Duty game to feature a battle royale mode. Launching after the battle royale boom in 2017, Blackout had 100 players drop onto a gigantic map to fight for their lives until only one player or team was left standing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Black Ops 4's battle royale map, Avalon, will also be returning. It featured fan-favorite named locations like Nuketown Island, as well as more generic locales like a train station and construction site. Avalon has changed several times over the years, and we don't know how it might change for this 2026 release, so none of the locations from the original map are guaranteed to return. While Avalon is positively viewed by many in the Warzone community, Verdansk and other Warzone maps are often viewed more favorably.</p><p>Warzone is also getting a new <a href="https://resurgence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resurgence </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-adding-new-resurgence-map-but-verdansk-isnt-going-anywhere/1100-6535109/" data-ref-id="1100-6535109">map</a> alongside Black Ops 7. The new map, Haven's Hollow, will be smaller than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's</a> open beta begins this weekend, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/here-are-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-early-access-and-open-beta-unlock-times/1100-6535114/" data-ref-id="1100-6535114">the official start times finally revealed</a>.

                <p>No one likes waiting, especially when there's nothing to do to pass the time. Peak developer Landfall Games had that same thought when working on Peak's most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DillyDally update</a>. It adds a handful of activities to lobbies while waiting for other players to join, including a basketball hoop, photo booth, and chess pieces.</p><p>Players went straight to work with the chess pieces, but not according to official rules the classic game uses.</p><p>"My friend and I got bored after we finished a climb," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imanthony89/" rel="nofollow ">Imanthony89</a> in a post on the Peak subreddit. "Used all the chess pieces and bing bong. That's a queen and a few pawns above the rafters"</p><p>The update released last week, and social media was flooded with chess pieces stacked ceiling-high in the airport lobby over the weekend. Peak's physics system, which can lead to some quirky antics on climbs, turned out to be perfect for some extracurricular activities for the scouts.</p><p>Peak lobbies are set in airport waiting areas, as the game begins with a playful loading-screen plane crash that sets you and your friends off on your journey to summit a procedurally generated mountain. The climb is almost never easy, so it makes sense that scouts should have some fun while waiting in the terminal.</p><p>Landfall Games and publisher Aggro Crab have released a few updates since Peak became a massive hit when it launched in June. A new biome, the Mesa--complete with tornadoes, scorching heat, and scorpions--was added in August. Another biome has also been teased, but no confirmed details have been shared yet.</p>
