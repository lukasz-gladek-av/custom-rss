                <p>In the 12 years since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, two of the three main characters, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips, have reappeared in Grand Theft Auto Online, while Michael De Santa has only been mentioned. But if the actors behind these iconic characters get their way, they'd reunite GTA 5's trio for one last heist. </p><p>Earlier this month, Steven Ogg (Trevor), Ned Luke (Michael), and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) made a joint appearance together at Comic Con Brussels (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-5s-michael-trevor-franklin-want-gta-6-return-in-final-score-story-dlc-3216565/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>). At the 12:40 mark in the video below, the actors spoke about their desire to reunite in a DLC for GTA Online called The Final Score, which was named by Luke. The trio stressed that Rockstar doesn't currently have any plans to bring them back together, and urged fans to campaign for it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkGCcdAhJUM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkGCcdAhJUM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rockstar has yet to shed light on whether GTA Online will continue following the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 next year. Take-Two executives have suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">that GTA Online may be unaffected</a>, but they've stopped short of confirming that. If the actors manage to convince Rockstar to bring them back one more time, it seems more likely to be for GTA 6 than GTA 5. </p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-latest-major-update-is-live-with-a-money-laundering-theme/1100-6532494/" data-ref-id="1100-6532494">GTA Online rolled out another large update</a> that lets players assume control of their own money laundering operation. One of the developers of GTA 3 recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-dev-wanted-online-mode-as-far-back-as-2001/1100-6532533/" data-ref-id="1100-6532533">the team wanted an online GTA game</a> as far back as 2001. There have also been hints that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">more major music personalities may get their own radio stations</a> in GTA 6.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Since its release on Thursday, Rematch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-a-soccer-game-from-the-developers-of-sifu-is-off-to-a-hot-start/1100-6532582/" data-ref-id="1100-6532582">has pulled in some solid numbers</a> and is picking up steam. With its relatively simple gameplay, Rematch is an enjoyable game to watch and play. play. Of course, with a growing player-base comes questions about what's next for the game, and the developers found time to address them. </p><p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534353549843235107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, the team behind Rematch went through a laundry list of updates, how they're working to prevent lag that affects gameplay, and addressed the potential of crossplay down the line. However, they also assured players they're taking one thing at a time.</p><p>"We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who joined us during the Early Access launch and shared valuable feedback," the statement read. "Seeing players from all over the world enjoying Rematch and expressing their excitement online has been incredibly rewarding."</p><p>The team had initially wanted to implement a crossplay feature, but "unforeseen technical complexities" prevented it from being ready on time. They added that they understand players' frustration and are going to get it working soon.</p><p>"It's very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority. We're committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we'll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible."</p><p>Here are also issues they're looking into for the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Core gameplay:</strong> Simple fixes like improving the sliding tackle, tweaks to goalkeeper mechanics, to the dribbling system and wall contact. All the while taking into account community feedback. The idea would be that as they move forward, test servers will be at work so they can try out new features and improvements in a live environment.</li><li><strong>Competitive features:</strong> They are currently designing a tournament system with a leaderboard system for players above Elite ranking. There's also a club creation system in the works that will be aiming to provide more variety for competitive players.</li><li><strong>Social components:</strong> While crossplay is their top priority, other features are also being worked on such as being able to spectate your squadâ€™s game when you join a squad. This will allow players to team up and rematch with teammates they enjoyed playing with, and more.</li><li><strong>Casual play features:</strong> Aside from a new quick play game mode and a rotating game mode queue, AI-controlled bots will be used so that players are able to train with and against the computer in both workshops or in dedicated game modes.</li></ul><p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year! We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game catalog, but can also be purchased for $30.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s major 11.2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a> will add a highly-requested feature fans have been waiting years forâ€“the ability to lean.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, as spotted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-lean-emote-on-patch-11-2-ptr-377340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the /lean emote is finally being added to Blizzard's MMORPG. It's the first major emote addition since 2008, when a large list of emotes were added as part of the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Lean is something players, and particularly roleplayers, have wanted for quite some time, as the ability for NPC characters to lean against terrain was added during 2018's Battle for Azeroth expansion. In 11.2, characters can use the lean emote to prop up against a wall and give off that oh-so-important mysterious adventurer vibe or practice being a mime and just lean in mid-air against nothing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">When compared to all the major new content coming with the Ghosts of K'aresh update, including a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Ecological Succession world activity, and an encounter against a Stormwind city-sized raid boss (the biggest boss in WoW's history, according to Blizzard), the addition of a new emote doesn't sound like a big deal. It is, however, a major win for the game's roleplayers, a community within WoW that Blizzard has stated (like in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">interview about WoW's 20th anniversary</a>) it is looking to do more for. Maybe players will get fully-animated hugs or high-fives next?</p><p dir="ltr">While it's the first time in a long time Blizzard has added an emote, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-9-1-5-will-remove-or-change-a-long-list-of-crude-emotes/1100-6496685/" data-ref-id="1100-6496685">changed or removed some emotes entirely in 2021</a> in the wake of a state of California lawsuit that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-california-after-settling-lawsuit/1100-6520018/" data-ref-id="1100-6520018">later settled</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, however, took various steps in its games while the lawsuit was still ongoing to make its communities more welcoming, including in WoW. Emotes like /kick, /moan, /rear, /smell and others were removed entirely, while some, like /drool and /whistle, were made so they could no longer target specific players.</p><p dir="ltr">The new lean emote is just one of Ghosts of K'aresh's new social features, as the update will also add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls'-like asynchronous multiplayer functions</a> to WoW's endgame Delves. WoW's 11.2 update does not yet have a release date and isn't yet available for testing on the game's public test realm, but players are already theorizing based on datamining that a new Void-themed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Demon Hunter specialization</a> could be coming soon.</p>

                <p>I'm here to tell you that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>'s free-roam mode is great when there isn't someone yapping in your ear about how "bad" and "empty" it is.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release a few weeks ago alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the latest installment in the vaunted kart-racing series has had a few more ups and downs than expected. For all the praise the game has accrued--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/">it received a 9 from GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>--Mario Kart World has also gotten its fair share of knocks and detractors, and a great deal of the criticism that's been aimed at it recently has centered on its free-roam mode. Those criticisms claim that the mode (and the world it makes available to players) is largely barren and what activities do fill it are lackluster.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode drops players onto the large interconnected roadways of the newest game. If a player wanted to, they could drive from Acorn Heights, the northernmost track in the game, all the way down to Dino Dino Jungle at the southern tip of the continent. All the while, they can zoom past Toads in cars, buses, and trucks on the highways that connect these courses to one another. Along the way, there are even P-Switches that toggle challenges and races, warp pipes that transport players to hidden rooms, collectable Peach medallions in out-of-the-way spots, and stickers to collect to garnish your player profile. It's simple, uncomplicated, and nice. The mode is exactly what it's been billed as, and I cannot really understand the heat it's getting.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've been basking in all free-roam has to offer, I'll be the first to admit that there isn't much else going on here. Challenges can often be pretty mindless, and while some can exasperate, most are over in a flash. The rewards for finding Peach medallions and question block panels are trivial and insignificant in the grand scheme of the game. Roaming around freely can feel like the gaming equivalent of consuming empty calories, and I recognize how this chafes against the expectations of players being dropped into a huge in-game world in 2025. But I think the fact that Mario Kart World's free-roam does away with the excess and frills is precisely the point of the mode, and it does my head in that there is an audience out there that isn't connecting with it because they want something else. This isn't the next Forza Horizon game, whose map will be dotted with countless side activities and missions for the player to do. It's Mario Kart World, and it's doing things its own way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World's free-roam mode features Rosalina's tour bus company and more.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I think there's a clear distinction between the notion of a video game with a "free-roam" mode, which is what's on offer in Mario Kart World, and an "open-world" game, a phrase that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-not-an-open-world-game-nintendo-says/1100-6532034/">Nintendo has explicitly stated it avoided</a> invoking throughout the game's development. The latter is a game like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Cyberpunk 2077, which are entirely different experiences you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/">also get on the Switch 2</a>. Hell, if we want to pit Mario Kart World against a proper open-world racing game, look no further than Forza Horizon 5. There are hundreds of other examples that you could find to fit that mold across gaming's history, but that won't change the core argument here: Mario Kart World is not an open-world game, and we're better off leaving it that way than arguing for it to become something it was never meant to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I say this because I've relished the quiet nights that I've squeezed out of Mario Kart World's free-roam mode. I've never taken a proper road trip, but I imagine the ability to make that space for peace and quiet is what it's all about. I've been conjuring those very vibes on the regular by aimlessly hitting the open road in World, going wherever it may take me, and taking pictures of the charming little world Nintendo has spun from this historic franchise. This is a place where I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">play as a cow</a>, pick up a burger from a fast-food restaurant operated by Yoshi, and park next to a Shy Guy seated on a bench. It's a world with hitchhiking Toads, random campsites, and a tour bus company apparently run by Rosalina. Some guy on the internet <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/04/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2/" rel="nofollow ">claims there are UFOs</a> to be found in free-roam, and others are taking over semi-trucks and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tahk0_/video/7516248904929725727?q=mario%20kart%20world%20area%2051&amp;t=1750311855590" rel="nofollow ">storming the gates of an in-game Area 51</a>. Sometimes, enjoying games means taking it on its own terms and appreciating the tiniest of moments and details, or just making your own fun, rather than expecting it to deliver some huge creative swings.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, free-roam also allows me to sidestep the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-mario-kart-world-tips-could-help-you-win-more-races/1100-6532281/">frankly ridiculously competitive nature</a> of Mario Kart World--which is more intense than it has ever been, thanks to a slew of new advanced maneuvers--and explore the sights of magnificent locales like I've never been able to before. Go to the Great ? Block Ruins in free-roam and really take in the view of the dilapidated skyscraper-sized block. Try to make sense of it, and if you can't, just bask in it. I know I sure did.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315"></a><figcaption>Sometimes, free-roam mode is perfect for a chill, late night drive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm sure I'll be called a mark or some kind of Nintendo apologist, but the simple truth is this: Mario Kart World fully delivers on a vibes-based free-roam mode, and I prefer that to any of the half-dozen overstuffed open-world titles available at any given moment. And hey, I love some of those games quite a lot, but a break from them is just as welcome as having more of them to play. Games that big can feel grand and adventurous to start before devolving into laborious trudges and when everything is an open-world RPG, it begins to feel like nothing is special. It's rare then to get a marquee title from a major developer and publisher like Nintendo that does away with the excess and cuts right to the chase, making Mario Kart World a breath of fresh air. Y'know, through the scent of exhaust fumes and Yoshi burgers.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, what else might you possibly want or need from an open-world Mario Kart game that you can't already get in the larger package of World? If you want to race, hit a grand prix or Knockout match. Want some challenges? Well, free-roam's already got those in spades, but there's an additional set of Time Trials that have long been a staple in the series. Want some competition? Go online and do some good ol' fashioned versus battles. If you want collectibles, the game's already got 'em!</p><p dir="ltr">When you really think about it, what's an actionable feature that could tangibly make Mario Kart's free-roam a richer experience? Side quests? Possible interactions with roaming NPCs? One-on-one races with rivals? I can see some of that working in this game, but by and large, I don't think any of it is the silver-bullet fix that'll enrich Mario Kart World for the players disgruntled by its implementation of free-roam. I think what they might be looking for is simply a different kind of game.</p><p>So yes, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode is not the most robust offering. If you come to it expecting the next great open-world title, you're likely to be sorely disappointed. What you get instead is so much better though, so much more <em>freeing</em>, and in a field awash with overstuffed and overstimulating titles around every corner, I'm grateful that Mario Kart World eschews those trends and stays in its own lane where it (and I) remain unbothered.</p>

                <p>Easily one of the most useful items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-compass-in-minecraft/1100-6524852/" data-ref-id="1100-6524852">compass</a>.

Sure, you can use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-minecraft-cheats-and-console-commands/1100-6531935/" data-ref-id="1100-6531935">Minecraft console commands</a> to change the spawn point if you're the Minecraft server owner, or have admin permissions, but if that does not apply to you, you'll want to learn about how lodestones can alter the direction a compass points. That's where we come in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822"></a><figcaption>A lodestone in the overworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg"></figure><p>Lodestones alter the place that your compass points to. It can also be used in the Nether, the End, and the overworld, whereas compasses only usually work in the overworld. Lodestones in the real world are naturally-occurring magnets, and rare to find.</p><h2>How to find a lodestone</h2><p>You can find lodestones in chests in bastion remnants, but you can also craft them. To create your own, place one iron ingot in the center of your crafting table, surrounded by chiseled stone bricks. It used to be more expensive to craft a lodestone, as instead of one iron ingot, a netherite ingot was required.</p><h2>How to use a lodestone</h2><p>Once you have your lodestone block, place it on the ground where you want the compass to point towards, take out your compass, and use it on the block. The compass will get the same sheen as enchanted armor gets, so you'll know whether it's worked or not.</p><p>If the lodestone is broken or in a different dimension than the compass, the compass will randomly spin. If the lodestone is destroyed while its paired compass is in a chest or storage item, then the compass will not register that the lodestone is destroyed until it is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone will prevent unpairing in this situation.</p><p>For more tips and hints, visit our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak â€“ Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Remedy released a patch today that including UI fixes and changes to how much unlockables costs. The studio re-organized unlockables into two categories: operational requisitions and essentials. Operational requisitions now include only cosmetics like sprays and armor sets while essentials includes gear and weapons. Essentials are now easier to unlock, according to the studio.</p><p>Remedy also detailed how they plan to change the "games' first hours" by better communicating how the crisis kits work and giving players better information on what to do within each mission. In addition, Remedy is giving new players deeper access to each job right off the bat, instead of limiting them to lower difficulties at the start.</p><p>The studio said it had been breaking down data and have more ideas on how to improve the overall experience but will need more time to execute.</p><p>"Todayâ€™s patch is just the beginning," the studio wrote. "These are some of the most immediate changes, but we are actively discussing and planning broader improvements to the game based on what we are hearing and seeing."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak was highly anticipated by fans of the Finnish studio, especially after strong showings with single-player adventures like Control and Alan Wake 2. While the gameplay is enjoyable, the number of problems quickly piled up. Many are still hopeful that Remedy can turn FBC: Firebreak into a fun and satisfying experience.</p><p>"As the game has launched on two different subscription services, I expect some players will likely try it, only to be quickly turned away by a subpar first impression and write Firebreak off without the lack of investment that might keep them around for longer," Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/#:~:text=Firebreak%20is%20a%20first-person,distance%2C%20and%20a%20lot%20more." data-ref-id="1900-6418376">GameSpot FBC:Firebreak review</a>. "Hopefully, those who enjoy co-op PvE games do stick around past the early roughness, because there's something really fun to uncover. Sometimes the game gets in its own way by not tutorializing key points, like how to best deal with status effects and play roles dependably. But once you've gained that institutional knowledge, FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects."</p>

Executive producer Scott Junior said each major update will be free and include new story and PvE content. These updates will be released alongside the game's paid DLCs, which can be bought standalone or together as part of the game's season pass.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Junior additionally mentioned Dune: Awakening will receive new PvE maps for players to explore in the future, though it's unclear if these would be included for free as a major update or come in the form of a paid expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the more immediate future, Junior said an update is coming in early July that will contain "too many" quality-of-life changes to list. Junior didn't go into detail on what those changes would be, but said to expect the patch notes when the patch is closer to being ready for testing.</p><p dir="ltr">Funcom dove into plenty of other topics as part of the AMA, ranging from plans to make it so players can name storage containers and vehicles to its thoughts on potential changes to Dune: Awakening's PvP-focused endgame. Many of players' complaints are focused around the heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a> in the game's endgame Deep Desert zone, so much so that PvP encounters are largely between flying Ornithopters rather than on-foot encounters where the game's melee and firearms can come into play. When asked about the potential of a Deep Desert zone where only ground vehicles would be allowed, creative director Joel Bylos shot down the idea but did say Funcom is looking to make some changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this," Bylos said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions players can expect in Dune: Awakening's future based on Funcom's Reddit answers include an option to duel other players, a deposit all option for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water-in-dune-awakening/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">water</a>, changes to the endgame PvE Landsraad system, additional contracts to complete, and a third faction that "will change the entire dynamic" of the Landsraad, according to Bylos.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is finding major success on Steam, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-the-lisan-al-gaib-of-dune-games-as-steam-concurrents-top-140000/1100-6532344/" data-ref-id="1100-6532344">surpassed 140,000 concurrent players</a>. Its most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">update addressed some of its endgame PvP problems</a> by making it so vehicles no longer deal damage when colliding with other players, as well as increased respawn timers in PvP zones. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">Dune: Awakening is still slated to launch on consoles</a>, but not until 2026.</p>

The premiere 2025 title from Capcom has seen recent user reviews on Steam decline into the "overwhelmingly negative" range, and more players are currently playing an older game from the series, Monster Hunter World.</p><p>Monster Hunter World is currently hosting over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/582010/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">16,000 concurrent players</a>. Wilds, in comparison, has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10,000 concurrent players</a> right now. World has been pulling in a peak of at least 25,000 players each day this week while Wilds has not broken the 23,000 player mark in that same period. Fans of the series are going back to World after being disappointed by the endgame content and performance issues in Wilds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Players have been sounding off about Monster Hunter Wilds' performance issues and other problems via Steam's review system. Many of the reviews cite frame rate issues, an unsatisfactory story, not enough endgame content, and a few go as far to say the game will no longer start on their computers.</p><p>Capcom brought new content to Monster Hunter World for two years after it was released. While it did have some performance issues, players never criticized the game as harshly on Steam. Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled to be part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-will-show-off-more-of-resident-evil-requiem-in-a-showcase-next-week/1100-6532567/" data-ref-id="1100-6532567">Capcom Spotlight</a> showcase stream next week where the publisher will show off an upcoming update. Players are hoping for some big additions to endgame content and upgrades to how the game runs on PC.</p><p>"Capcom understands the value of throwing you into one climactic battle after another in what would be a set-piece boss fight in almost any other game," Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpots Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> at the beginning of 2024. "Monster Hunter Wilds suffers from some performance issues, the environments are often bland, and the story feels superfluous, but when you're face-to-face with a fearsome monster, few situations are quite as riveting. Monster Hunter Wilds may only make iterative improvements to further refine the formula, but that's all it really needed to do."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Palworld Ã— Terraria | Tides of Terraria Major Update Animated Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Pocketpair has said that players will be able to "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria" as if they were any other creature from Palworld. Palworld is currently on sale for 25% off its full price on both Steam and the PlayStation Store.</p><p>Palworld hasn't had any other crossovers since it launched at the beginning of 2024. Terraria is one of the more popular games that Pocketpair could have partnered with for this update. The sandbox adventure game launched in 2011 and still has over 30,000 concurrent players on Steam 14 years later.</p><p>Palworld has also been in the midst of a lawsuit filed by Nintendo for allegedly infringing on its patents for gameplay. Palworld has made several changes to its game, including removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pal Spheres. More gameplay and artistic changes are expected to come as legal proceedings continue.</p>
