                <p>In 2024, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Palworld developer Pocketpair on patent infringement claims, and now Palworld's community manager has revealed more details on how it all went down.</p><p>Appearing at GDC 2025 this week, community manager John Buckley said Pocketpair did "legal checks" prior to Palworld's release to try to mitigate a lawsuit risk in Japan, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/it-was-a-very-depressing-day-palworld-community-manager-reveals-studios-reaction-to-nintendo-lawsuit/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a>. Given that, Buckley said the team was confused when Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Pocketpair in Japan.</p><p>"When the lawsuit was announced we were like, 'What?' And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts and asked, 'What's going on?' and that's when we realized it was patents they were going for,'" Buckley said.</p><p>He added that it was a "very depressing day" for Pocketpair when it got sued, adding that developers at Pocketpair are big fans of the Pokemon series.</p><p>"It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version, we were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show, so obviously we had to scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that," Buckley said.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question for the lawsuit are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered on the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD). </a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>Palworld continues to grow, as Pocketpair has just recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">cross-play is coming at the end of March 2025.</a></p>

                <p>Microsoft will soon expand the roster of titles in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">Game Pass Core</a> library, something it rarely does. The cheapest Game Pass tier ($10/month) will add three more games on March 26.</p><p>These include three celebrated games: Batman: Arkham Knight, Monster Sanctuary, and Tunic.</p><p>An evolution of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass Core grants subscribers access to dozens of games on console, as well as online multiplayer access and member-exclusive discounts. As mentioned, Game Pass Core's game library doesn't get updated very often, making this a notable event.</p><p>Microsoft describes the Core catalog as being "curated," and indeed the three upcoming releases are all pretty highly regarded. There are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#coreall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 games in the Core catalog</a>, so the upcoming three will push the Core library to 50 titles in all. Game Pass Core is available only on console.</p><p>Some of the other games in the Core catalog include Vampire Survivors, Halo 5, Stardew Valley, Limbo, Hellblade, Fallout 76, Grounded, Firewatch, Dishonored 2, Celeste, and Among Us.</p><p>By comparison, Game Pass Standard ($15/month) includes "hundreds" of games, while Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) includes all of that plus day-one new releases for all first-party games, cloud gaming access, and an EA Play membership.</p><p>As for Game Pass Ultimate, the library grows this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">a bunch more games</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-10-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6327/" data-ref-id="2900-6327">10 games are getting axed soon</a>.</p>

                <p>If you fondly remember the old days of Counter-Strike before newfangled inventions like the Source engine, we've got good news for you. The mod team behind CSPromod has announced CS: Legacy, a standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built entirely in Valve's Source SDK.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PspuiHlF5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PspuiHlF5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you can see from the above announcement trailer, the project features classic maps like de_nuke, all gussied up with 4K textures. It even has the static falling-over death animation that Counter-Strike 1.6 players remember well. According to the trailer, the project is coming to Steam Early Access in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Posts on the project's Discord suggest that the initial release will include the classic maps Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, and Aim_map. The small team behind CS: Legacy previously worked together on CSPromod back in the 2000s, which was an attempt to bring CS 1.6-style gameplay to the Source engine. The original Counter-Strike released in 2000, and was replaced with Counter-Strike: Source in 2004, a change that was considered controversial in the community at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Counter-Strike news, in a documentary released for the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2's release, Valve discussed a Counter-Strike-based <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reflects-on-lawsuit-that-could-have-killed-the-company/1100-6527883/" data-ref-id="1100-6527883">lawsuit with Vivendi</a> that nearly destroyed the company. Essentially, Valve accused Vivendi of distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission; the suit was later settled.</p>
