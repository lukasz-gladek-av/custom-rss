                <p>The long-awaited 1.2 patch is out now for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, introducing official modding support and the ability to give Henry a new look, among many other changes.</p><p>Described as a "major update" that is the result of five months of work, patch 1.2 includes more than 1,000 fixes and improvements in total. Players can expect gameplay balance improvements and equipment adjustments, in addition to a range of bug fixes. The update also adds more country-specific localization, including traditional and simplified Chinese and new French voiceover.</p><p>One of the big additions in the update is the arrival of a barber shop where players can change Henry's bear and hair styles. Players who give Henry a new look will find a bonus in the form of a buff to Henry's charisma.</p><p>As for the official modding support, Kingdom Come 2 now connects with Steam Workshop so players can create and install mods to the game in an officially sanctioned capacity. Warhorse said more than 300 elements of the game can be modded, including UI and combat mechanics, as well as AI behavior. As with any mods, the only real limit is a person's imagination.</p><p>The full patch notes are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-goes-drm-free-soon-massive-1-2-patch-release-date-confirmed/1100-6529970/" data-ref-id="1100-6529970">dozens of pages long</a>, and <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can see them on the game's official website</a>.</p><p>In addition to free updates, Warhorse will release new story expansions for Kingdom Come 2 through the game's paid expansion pass.

                <p dir="ltr">After almost nine years, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft has announced</a> a major milestone for the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative. There are now more than 1,000 games that support the feature, which lets people buy the title once and play it across Xbox platforms, Windows 10/11 PCs, and some PC gaming handhelds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-play-anywhere-feature-goes-live-in-september/1100-6441463/">Xbox Play Anywhere went live in September 2016</a>, originally working between Xbox One and PCs. The feature also includes cross-save functionality and only works with digital copies of games. As a fun bit of trivia, the first Xbox Play Anywhere-supported game was ReCore, with Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4, and Halo Wars 2 following behind it. While sounding similar, it's important to note that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/">cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass</a> is different from Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458937"></a><figcaption>Microsoft has unveiled that there are more than 1,000 Xbox Play Anywhere-supported games. That means you can buy them on Xbox and then play them on PC or a PC gaming handheld for no extra cost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"When we look at data for titles that are Xbox Play Anywhere enabled, these titles get 20% more gameplay because it's more flexible, because I can play on the go," said Xbox vice president of next generation Jason Ronald. Mentioning "on the go" is eyebrow-raising, especially after a report earlier this week pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">a possible Xbox-branded handheld launching later this year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this feeds into Xbox's latest ad campaign that reminds people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">Xbox is more than just a traditional home console</a>. However, that doesn't necessarily mean Microsoft is getting out of the hardware business. Earlier this week, an insider <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">claimed that an Xbox Series X successor is currently planned for 2027</a>. It might also launch alongside an internally developed Xbox handheld.</p>
