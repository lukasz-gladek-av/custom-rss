In what seemed like an inevitability, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">PlayStation announced hardware price increases</a> in the US on PS5 consoles. All three models are increasing by $50 on August 21, which bumps the PS5 Slim Digital from $450 to $500.</p><p>Released in May, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PS5 Slim Digital bundle already offered terrific value at its $400 promotional price. Based on current prices, the bundle is valued at $520. Even if you don't care about Call of Duty, you're still saving $50 versus buying the console on its own. Based on the new PS5 prices, the savings doubles to $100 just for the console. Black Ops 6 is just the cherry on top here.</p><p>PlayStation also released a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+This+PS5+Slim+Digital+Bundle+For+%24400+Before+It+Sells+Out&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A35&amp;fnarticle_id=6534138&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Agamespot%2Far%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%253A%252F%252Fdirect.playstation.com%252Fen-us%252Fbuy-consoles%252Fplaystation5-console-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bundle-model-group-slim&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases%2F1100-6534138%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">regular PS5 Slim version of this bundle</a> for $450, but it's no longer in stock at any retailers. Since this is a promotional console bundle, it's unlikely to increase in price alongside the standalone PS5 Slim Digital. But it's also unlikely to be in stock when the price increases go into effect.</p><h3>PlayStation 5 hardware prices starting August 21</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim</a> – <strong>$550</strong> (was $500)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim Digital</a> – <strong>$500</strong> (was $450)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Pro</a> -- <strong>$750</strong> (was $700)</li></ul><p>All three models are in stock for the lower prices at Amazon, so you can get the PS5 Pro for $699 and PS5 Slim with a disc drive for $500 until tomorrow (August 21).</p><hr>

                <p>Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive have announced that they are remastering their sci-fi strategy city builder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/surviving-mars/">Surviving Mars</a>. Appropriately titled Surviving Mars: Relaunched, this new version of the game will feature "enhanced graphics," new UI, and even some new content not featured in the original game.</p><p>One such addition is a new gameplay feature called Martian Assembly, which adds colony factions into the game. This means that colonists will now have their own agendas and personal demands, with the ability to set up laws and policies--you'll even be able to gain full independence from Earth. Another key aspect of this remastered version of the game is that there will be "expansive" mod support that works across all platforms. These platforms include PC, as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYdb13fqECo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cYdb13fqECo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Aside from including the original base game, the remaster will also feature every single bit of DLC. That includes all of the game's major and minor expansions, cosmetics, and radio stations. The game is launching at $40, but players that own the original version of the game will be able to pick it up at a discounted price of $20, as long as you're doing so on the same platform you originally bought it on.</p><p dir="ltr">Surviving Mars launched back in 2018, and received generally positive reviews at the time. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/surviving-mars-review-building-the-final-frontier/1900-6416877/">Surviving Mars review</a> gave the game an 8/10, finding some strong design choices and captivating aesthetics, even if some of the game's concepts weren't always explained the best.</p><p dir="ltr">Surviving Mars: Relaunched doesn't have a release date just yet, only described as coming soon, but it will be available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S whenever it does launch.</p>
