                <p>Introduced in Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_Portal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portal</a> is a mode that allows players to create custom game modes, and for Battlefield 6, it's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609"> getting a big overhaul</a>. UX director Alan Pimm said in a new interview that Battlefield Studios is putting a lot of investment into Portal for this year's game in part because fans want a game they can keep playing over and over again and finding new things along the way.</p><p>"People don't just want a game that they can complete," Pimm told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. "They want one that they can grow, that they can evolve, or they can make their dreams come true."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CHDiFW0wA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Portal is similar to Fortnite's Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Halo's Forge. For Battlefield 6, the developer is expanding what's possible and allowing users to create entire maps, and these maps and modes will provide XP like you'd get in the official playlists. However, anyone hoping to create a map with an XP exploit shouldn't expect that to work. The Portal mode will displays warnings within the editor to alert creators about whether or not their creation will allow for genuine XP gain or not.</p><p>Pimm said Battlefield 6's Portal mode was designed to help players "have a good time" and find something they want to play, even if it wasn't made by Battlefield Studios itself.</p><p>"[We want to] listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible," Pimm said.</p><p>During the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal event, the developers showed off a brief look at what's possible with the new version of Portal. In one sequence, we see something that looks like it's out of GTA Online, with a player piloting a jet through a floating ring of tanks high above the ground. This was just one example of the totally out-there types of game modes that players will be able to create.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/" data-ref-id="1100-6533674">server browser</a> so players can find the maps and modes they're looking for.</p><p>During EA's latest financial briefing, CEO Andrew Wilson called out user-generated content as one of the ways the company is seeking to <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Prepared-Remarks.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"unlock the full potential of our strategy."</a></p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta begins August 7 for a limited group of players before expanding more widely later in the month. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-is-available-to-download-now-as-preloading-and-file-sizes-go-live/1100-6533668/" data-ref-id="1100-6533668">Preloading is available now</a> on all platforms, and you can find out more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta guide.</a> The full game launches October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shared more details on its upcoming expansion to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" data-ref-id="5000-538660">Kirby and the Forgotten World</a>, and it's looking like a great time for Kirby fans when it releases later this month.</p><p>Eager to win an award for the longest game name, Nintendo's upcoming Kirby and the Forgotten World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed Worlds will serve as both an upgrade and expansion to Kirby's 2022 platforming adventure. The Switch 2 version of the game will feature improved visuals and performance alongside a breadth of new levels and features.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3bJ8tGrj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2h3bJ8tGrj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Star-Crossed World DLC, Kirby will set off to find star fragments--which are aptly-named Starries--and use them to seal away an evil presence brought upon The Forgotten Land by a fallen meteor. The meteor's impact has transformed levels throughout The Forgotten Land to create Starry Stages, which players will need to explore thoroughly to find previously inaccessible areas if they want to find all of the Starries.</p><p>In addition to new stages, Star-Crossed Worlds will also introduce three new Mouthful modes. With these all-new additions, Kirby will be able to swallow and transform into Spring Mouth to jump higher than ever, Gear Mouth to climb walls, and Sign Mouth to slide down slopes.</p><p>Players who enjoy going all-in on collectibles will also be able to find Starry Coins scattered throughout the new levels that can be used to purchase new figures to add to Kirby's ever-growing collection from the base game. Meanwhile, there's even a new challenge to be found at the Colosseum in Waddle Dee Town, offering what are likely to be the most difficult fights yet.</p><p>If you already own Kirby and the Forgotten Land, you can purchase an upgrade pack containing the Nintendo Switch 2 improvements and Star-Crossed World add-on for $20. Alternatively, the base game and upgrade pack are available combined for $80.</p>

The game will feature a "preferred input" matchmaking system, where players using controllers (on Xbox and PlayStation) are primarily matched with other controller users. Likewise, PC players using a mouse and keyboard will be grouped. Cross-play between the two input types will only occur when needed to fill lobbies. This new system aims to reduce input-based advantages while still maintaining quick matchmaking.</p><p>According to producer Alexia Christofi, the game will prioritize keeping players within their preferred community. It will expand to mix platforms when regional player counts are too low for stable matchmaking. This approach is designed to improve fairness in matches while still ensuring low lags and fast match creation. Cross-play will still be fully toggleable in the settings for players who want more control.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951700052625518667" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Eyy not quite, it's crossplay on or off - but if crossplay is on we treat it as console preferred crossplay, so we'll try and matchmake you with others playing on console before falling back to full crossplay if we can't find you a match with only/mostly console players.</p>  — Alexia Christofi (@Lex_mate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951700052625518667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reflect-on-battlefield-2042s-poor-launch-and-how-it-shaped-new-game/1100-6533676/" data-ref-id="1100-6533676">Battlefield 2042</a>, cross-play between console and PC was fully enabled by default, which led to imbalanced matches, resulting in <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-2042-general-discussion-en/re-severely-unbalanced-teams/6997455" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uneven gameplay experiences</a>. Battlefield 6 builds on this by treating cross-play as a fallback option rather than the default setup.</p><p>EA is also addressing questions surrounding skill-based matchmaking (SBMM), which has become a debated feature in modern shooters. In Battlefield 6, EA states (via <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1952011658143924686" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>) that matchmaking will focus on ping to ensure players are close to servers, while skill will factor into matchmaking to varying degrees, depending on game mode and player count. However, exact details haven't been fully outlined.</p><p>The game will include core features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-aims-to-bring-back-comprehensive-destruction-from-much-loved-bad-company-2/1100-6533686/" data-ref-id="1100-6533686">the series is known for</a>, including large-scale battles, class-based squad combat, vehicle warfare, and environmental destruction.</p><p>Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-is-available-to-download-now-as-preloading-and-file-sizes-go-live/1100-6533668/" data-ref-id="1100-6533668">launches</a> on October 10, 2025, for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-ridiculous-amount-of-players-before-beta-even-begins/1100-6533684/" data-ref-id="1100-6533684">open beta</a> beginning on August 9.</p>

That's a very loose description if we're being honest, as this new teaser is essentially a highlight reel of gore that shows off a variety of methods for inflicting brutal damage on the infected around you. If you're squeamish and you don't want to lose your lunch, then you might want to look away, as this sizzle reel of ultraviolence doesn't hold back.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyhySFnQpmg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SyhySFnQpmg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Techland says that the "primal brutality" of Dying Light: the Beast isn't just for show, as it's meant to mirror protagonist Kyle Crane's thirst for revenge. After being imprisoned for a decade and subjected to brutal experiments, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-smashes-through-the-zombie-horde-in-august/1100-6532167/">Crane's got some pent-up frustration</a> that he needs to let go of, and it looks like carnage is his catharsis, thanks to his new rage-fueled powers.</p><p>"We've dramatically increased the body horror to give you this feeling of fighting for pure survival and Kyle's hunger for revenge," Dying Light franchise director Tymon Smektała said in a press statement. It's one thing to see a health bar go down; it's another entirely to see the flesh peel away from bone or have a burnt and destroyed faces only inches away from you--that’s how nightmares are made!"</p><p>To amp up the bodily harm in the game, Techland says that the art team did extensive research to improve all of the visuals of wounds and injuries. These also match with the various infected bodies seen on the streets, and to create realistic blood splatters, <a href="https://youtu.be/1JQ7bUrOka0" rel="nofollow ">the studio brought in gallons of fake blood</a> and recreated what it needed in real-life with an actor. "I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history," lead character artist Dominik Wasieńko said.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in August, Dying Light: The Beast will be out on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Make sure to check out our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-diamonds-in-minecraft-best-diamond-mining-level/1100-6531708/">Minecraft diamonds</a> for tips on how to easily find enough for crafting your armor.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting, <strong>Chainmail</strong> is an armor set that can't be crafted. Chainmail can only be obtained through mob drops, chest loot, and trading. It's recommended to use the Looting III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-enchantment-guide-roundup-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enchanting-your-gear/1100-6497408/">enchantment</a> on your sword or other tool to increase your chances of these drops.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Netherite armor</strong> set is actually an upgrade to the diamond armor, so you can't actually craft a set of this type. Instead, you'll need to complete a more complicated process, which we guide you through below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528306" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528306"></a><figcaption>Full diamond armor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_armor_pieces">How to craft armor pieces</h2><p dir="ltr">You can place leather, gold, iron, or diamond materials in the crafting grid to create sets made of those four material types. No matter the type, each set piece will need a specific amount of materials.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft a helmet, you'll need five of the same material. For the chestplate, you'll need eight of the same material. The leggings require seven of the same type, and the boots require four.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Netherite_armor_upgrade">Netherite armor upgrade</h2><p dir="ltr">The Netherite set requires a few steps before you can upgrade, but this is the best armor in Minecraft and a recommended option if you're planning on fighting the boss-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-warden-spawns-drops-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531623/">Warden mobs</a> or taking down the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/">Ender Dragon</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Upgrading to a suit of Netherite armor takes Netherite Ingots and smithing templates to upgrade. First, we'll start with the ingots.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Netherite">How to get Netherite</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528304" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528304"></a><figcaption>Ancient Debris block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Netherite is a material found by mining Ancient Debris found in the Nether. Ancient Debris can be found between levels Y-8 and 24, but level 15 is one of the most abundant for this block type. These blocks can only be mined with a diamond pickaxe, so make sure you have one equipped. The blocks look like brown versions of cobblestone and an example can be seen in the image above. They won't just be visible from the surface of the nether, you'll need to mine blocks away to reveal them.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_make_Netherite_Ingots">How to make Netherite Ingots</h3><p dir="ltr">Ancient Debris can be smelted in a furnace to make Netherite Scrap. These scraps can then be crafted into Netherite Ingots. One block of Ancient Debris makes a single Netherite Scrap, and you need four scraps and four gold ingots to make one Netherite Ingot. Four ingots are needed to upgrade a full set of diamond armor to Netherite, and this math means you need 16 ingots total.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_a_Netherite_Upgrade_Smithing_Template">How to get a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template</h3><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Netherite Ingots, you'll also need to head into the Nether in search of a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template item. These are found by looting a Bastion, which are the castle-like structures with Piglins. These are mostly random finds in the chest, but the Treasure Room variant of the Bastions has a guaranteed template spawn. Head all the way down into the bottom of this bastion and loot the chest found in the gold room. This is a guaranteed spawn for the Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template.</p><p dir="ltr">You need <strong>one template for each armor piece</strong> in the set. It's tedious to search for four of these in the Nether, but you can duplicate them at a crafting table. You'll need to place the Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template, a block of Netherrack, and seven diamonds into the crafting grid in order to duplicate the item. Repeat this process until you have at least four, and you might want to duplicate a fifth time so you have one saved for a future upgrade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528307" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528307"></a><figcaption>Smithing the Netherite armor upgrade</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_upgrade_to_Netherite_armor">How to upgrade to Netherite armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you have your templates, ingots, and diamond armor pieces, you can then head to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-craft-and-use-a-minecraft-smithing-table/1100-6531944/">smithing table</a> to upgrade your armor set.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_repair_armor">How to repair armor</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Anvil_method">Anvil method</h3><p dir="ltr">It can be a lot of work to craft armor sets, and you'll want to maintain your set pieces after you've battled against mobs. Damaged armor can best be repaired by using an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-an-anvil-in-minecraft/1100-6524993/">anvil</a>. The anvil can be used in two different ways, and while <strong>both of these methods cost XP</strong>, the anvil will preserve any enchantments on your armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528309" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528309"></a><figcaption>Repairing an iron helmet at an anvil</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One way is to add two items of the exact same type into the anvil. An example would be to place a diamond helmet with the lowest durability into the first slot and an additional diamond helmet into the second slot.</p><p dir="ltr">The second way requires you to cover the cost of repair with a material. Add the item you want to repair into the first slot, and then add the corresponding material into the second slot. So, for repairing a diamond helmet this way, you'll need diamonds to pay the material cost.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combining_method">Combining method</h3><p dir="ltr">You can technically repair armor pieces by combining them with another armor piece of the exact same type. Example: An iron helmet is needed to combine with another iron helmet.</p><p dir="ltr">This method isn't recommended if you have enchantments on your armor because the process of combining it will <strong>remove the existing enchantments</strong>. However, this can be the cheaper alternative if you don't have any enchantments to preserve and you have extra armor pieces you're looking to reduce in your inventory.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_customize_armor">How to customize armor</h2><p dir="ltr">If you care about how you look in battle, the smithing table also lets you add a colorful flair to your set with armor trim.

In particular, it's a frustrating point when considering how much fandom drives the success of certain productions.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking at FanX's Tampa Bay Comic Convention (via <a href="https://collider.com/baldurs-gate-3-aliona-baranova-game-adaptations-actor-inequality/" rel="nofollow ">Collider</a>), Baranova said that it's "a shame that the video game audience is being overlooked when it comes to screen projects. We see from you guys how dedicated you are … and I feel like that's been neglected at the moment by filmmakers [and] studios."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She went on to note how dedication from fans, particularly from queer communities, can really lift a film or show up. "There was a medical drama I did in the UK … Maternal. I’ve seen that it’s been translated into Chinese, all my scenes have been found, translated into Chinese, and put on Bilibili and watched thousands of times," Baranova said. She also noted how other Baldur's Gate 3 stars have found a lot of support, like the voice of Shadowheart, Jennifer English, who "had a short film at the BFI that premiered … she posted a story on Instagram, and last minute, 60 people travelled to come and support her."</p><p dir="ltr">In turn, because of how fans of video game actors can show massive amounts of support for various projects they're involved in, Baranova finds it frustrating when they get overlooked, pointing to how "Ashley Johnson was the number-one-most-looked-up person on IMDb," when her episode of the live-action adaptation of The Last of Us came out. "Why is more of that not happening? Why was Doug Cockle not in the TV series, The Witcher? Why are we not being considered when there's video game adaptations? Even animated adaptations like Arcane, we would love to be part of those."</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably worth noting that in the case of the live-action Witcher series, that one is a separate adaptation of the books, even if it can't be denied it might not exist without the success of the games. The point still stands that adaptations of games do often leave out the people that helped make them, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-composer-of-dk-rap-goes-uncredited-in-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512983/">in all sorts of ways</a>. As Baranova put it, it's a "shame that that's being overlooked. It's being slept on."</p>

The game's Steam page revealed that the game requires between 55GB and 80GB of storage space, which, even at the high end, is smaller than some modern games.</p><p>A spokesperson for EA told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/bucking-the-trend-of-triple-digit-installs-ea-confirms-battlefield-6s-file-size-can-be-as-low-as-55-gigs-you-will-be-able-to-pick-and-choose-which-components-of-the-game-you-install/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that the discrepancy in file sizes for Battlefield 6 on Steam comes down to how players can pick and choose which components of the game they want to install. For example, players can choose to only install single-player or multiplayer, if they wish.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The exact file sizes for Battlefield 6's various installable components were not made clear, nor do we know if the same option will be available on console, or the file sizes for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Battlefield's main competitor in the FPS space, Call of Duty, is known for its gigantic file sizes and storage space requirements. Like Battlefield, though, players can pick and choose what elements of a Call of Duty game they want to install, whether that's the campaign, multiplayer, or other parts.</p><p>Call of Duty HQ, the launcher that includes the newest Call of Duty games, just got significantly smaller, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-two-call-of-duty-games-are-being-removed-from-cod-hq-today/1100-6533512/" data-ref-id="1100-6533512">two major Call of Duty games leaving the launcher.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta begins August 7 for a limited group of players before expanding more widely later in the month. Preloading is available now on all platforms, and you can find out more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta guide. </a></p>
