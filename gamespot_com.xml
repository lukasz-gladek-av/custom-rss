                <p>The storytellers behind Blizzard's Story and Franchise Development team have decided to unionize. Following the results of a union-authorization vote, Blizzard's SFD will now join the Communications Workers of America in Orange County, California. Additionally, Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the SFD team's union vote.</p><p>There have been two previous unionization votes at Blizzard in the past year. In July 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">the developers behind World of Warcraft voted to unionize</a> and joined CWA. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">Overwatch 2 team passed a similar vote in May 2025</a>, and also joined CWA.</p><p>One of the SFD union organizers, Buddy Fisk, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a statement through CWA</a> citing the increasingly frequent layoffs in the video game industry as a driving force behind this vote.</p><p>"After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I've seen all the highs and lows," said Fisk. "For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading. With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone."</p><p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a> last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-rumble-will-receive-no-new-content-amidst-layoffs-at-blizzard/1100-6532929/" data-ref-id="1100-6532929">Blizzard lost many members of the team dedicated</a> to the mobile game Warcraft Rumble. Across Microsoft as a whole, approximately 9,000 jobs were lost.</p><p>Earlier this month, Diablo general manager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Rod Fergusson announced his departure from Blizzard</a> after spending half a decade with the company. Blizzard has also signaled some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">changes to the way it interacts with Diablo 4 fans in Campfire Chats</a>. Additionally, Blizzard president Johanna Faries hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/" data-ref-id="1100-6530062">more TV and movies based on the studio's franchises</a> may eventually be made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">My first Evo was all the way back in 2003, when it was held at Cal Poly Pomona. It was a ragtag yet passionate operation where a bunch of weirdos crammed into one of the university's big halls to play fighting games and watch the best of the best from across North America (and the Japanese players they convinced to come attend) duke it out. There were a bunch of PlayStation 2 consoles and arcade machines, a few projection screens, and some seats if you wanted to either watch or play some games. There were no ads or major announcements--the entertainment during downtime consisted of fan-made combo videos and somebody playing the overhead levels of Contra III. Despite all of the tech hiccups and the obvious drive to run things as cheaply as possible, we all <em>loved</em> it there.</p><p dir="ltr">Never would I have dreamed that, almost a quarter-century later, Evo would become one of gaming's most-talked-about annual events: a celebration of love and community in fighting games that even people not really into the genre would tune in to watch online. Evo now occupies an entire, massive hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center, where thousands of players from around the world come for a chance to compete and share their passion for fighting games in a variety of ways--be it entering tournaments, running side events, drawing and selling art in the Artists Alley, cosplaying, or just playing casual sets all day with people they've never met before. In a way, the main Evo event has morphed from a tournament into a full-blown fighting game convention, where the tournaments are now just a major part of the show, not necessarily the sole reason why many of the people are there.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But with that rapid growth has come a massive price tag. If you didn't purchase admission early, a weekend competition pass to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/evo-2025-everything-announced-at-the-annual-three-day-fighting-game-fest/2900-6841/" data-ref-id="2900-6841">Evo 2025</a> was around $250, plus $10 for each of the official tournament games you wanted to enter. If you paid early and just wanted to watch or play casuals with other attendees, that would still set you back $180. That's not taking into account all of the other expenses: gas or airfare to get to Las Vegas, and then lodging, transportation, food once you're there. And that doesn't take into account a bunch of other miscellaneous expenses you might unexpectedly run into (Is your joystick bag too big? That's a checked-bag fee). Sure, there are ways to cut costs--the tried-and-true method of cramming a gaggle of people into a single hotel room is a favorite--but oftentimes they can wind up costing just as much or more. Staying at a cheaper hotel that's farther away from the LVCC? The moment you step into 105-degree Vegas summer heat, you're going to ditch the idea of walking and get a Lyft instead.</p><p dir="ltr">While Evo was just as lively this year as it was in 2024--and much better-run in general--several people I know who were usually reliable event attendees weren't there. In fact, the majority of the faces I saw frequently from attending weekly and monthly Portland-area fighting game gatherings didn't go to Evo. For some, a big reason was work or life conflicts, but even when those were factors, another thing always came up:<strong> "It's just too expensive."</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And it's not just Evo that's priced out of reach, either--a lot of big fighting game events have become quite costly to attend. My partner and I went to Combo Breaker in the Chicago suburbs in 2023 and had a fantastic time. We'd love to go back, but for us, it's almost as expensive as Evo. I'd like to attend Community Effort Orlando, but that's both an expensive outing and an extremely long flight from the Pacific Northwest. I can only afford to attend one big fighting game event per year, so I need to pick wisely.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't always like this. Fighting games are viewed as something of a "working class" esport. Many beloved players over the years have come from distinctly less-privileged backgrounds: inspirational tales of kids who had to get good at fighters because they wanted to make their quarters in the arcade last longer, or because they only had a few games for their console. Top players in all games have emerged from places all across the globe. The great class equalizer is "How well can you hit your buttons?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite this, it's extremely hard for many players to be able to join these big competitions. Incredible players in many regions--including North America itself--are simply unable to come and compete on the global stage due to prices of travel, lodging, and tournament entry. Depending on your nationality, you might have a long, arduous, and expensive visa process before you can come and play anywhere else besides your home country--and you're not necessarily guaranteed approval. (It's a minor miracle that the Pakistani Tekken champions managed to get to their first Evo events at all a few years back.) For many talented but unknown players without sponsorships, these obstacles are exceptionally difficult to surmount.</p><p dir="ltr">Big tournaments can be an even harder sell if you're just a typical fighting game player. Statistically, you're probably not going to win Evo and recoup any prize money. In fact, you're very likely to go 0-2 in a major game. And most folks know that, so essentially, you're paying for a fun weekend with other fighting game nerds. But how much is the average fighting game player willing or able to pay for that experience when they can just go online to find people to spar against?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319" data-ratio="0.56164383561644" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's true that many younger fighting game players have likely grown through online competition, but many players also value the in-person, communal aspect of fighting games. But local options for smaller in-person meets and tournaments can be limited depending on where you live. Running even a small fighting game event can put you at a financial risk--event spaces don't come cheap, especially when internet packages are factored in (since events are generally expected to be livestreamed). Perhaps, if you're lucky, you can find a place willing to provide you some space at a discount--some of the monthly fighting game gatherings here in Portland happen at card and tabletop game stores and bars. Then you'll likely discover that being a Tournament Operator is a tiring, often thankless position. Many who try to establish local events go into burnout after a short while--it takes a certain mentality and dedication to make this work consistently, and not everyone can manage it.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to this, there's been a severe decrease in the number of established, moderately sized fighting game events over the past several years. As Evo and other big fighting game events increase in price, more affordable mid-size regionals like SoCal and NorCal Regionals, Kumite in Tennessee, and East Coast Throwdown have vanished. Some of these events were put on pause during COVID and never came back. Some grew too big for the hotel and college student-union ballrooms they were hosted in but weren't big enough to afford a convention space. Some went away because the organizers were just exhausted or needed to move on with life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the players who do have the means to attend the big events--either out of pocket or through sponsorships--tend to have an advantage. Events like the Capcom World Tour, the Tekken World Tour, and the SNK World Championship offer massive prize pots, but getting into these events often means entering as many big qualifiers as possible--which requires travel, and that requires money. And the sponsors are only willing to pay for events that look like good investments--meaning those small- and mid-size tournaments that are around struggle to bring in non-local top players that could encourage more people to attend.</p><p dir="ltr">This situation doesn't just hurt the players, but those who enjoy watching the games, too. Everyone loves seeing underdogs and/or new blood do well--just look at how many hearts the young Micky won over in his third-place Street Fighter 6 run at Evo this year. But think about the many other talented players out there we don't even know about who <em>could</em> have similar amazing performances on those grand stages. They can't, because the hurdles are too much to overcome.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">What can be done to fix this? It's difficult to come up with a clear solution, but there are ideas. Many publishers already hold online qualifiers for some of their big events, though there are caveats--in some cases, you still have to worry about your travel and lodging costs. The idea of global online tournaments is shaky, since even the most robust rollback netcode can buckle under the weight of a cross-continental journey--or even just shoddy Wi-Fi.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the publishers and hardware-makers themselves could help. Helping sponsor some smaller, local events in metro areas would be a step forward in community engagement, and could lay the groundwork for bigger, better events moving forward. Maybe a community "scholarship" fund could be established to help promising players afford travel to big events and make their mark. Maybe we can offer discounted event passes in some cases. I'm really just spitballing here, but it's clear that if we don't start to nip this problem in the bud, it could do lasting damage to the soul of the fighting game community.</p><p dir="ltr">While I had a fantastic time at Evo 2025 and am glad to see how far it's come, it also feels like it's veering in an alarming direction. The eye-rolling Chipotle ad placements are one thing--of course the commercial element is going to have to come in when the payouts get big. Rather, it's the fact that so many people I know won't or can't go to Evo anymore. Evo used to be where you went because all of your fighting game friends from everywhere would be there, together, for that one weekend of the year. But Evo and other big tournaments are feeling more and more exclusive. Fighting games should be open to everyone, and we need to make the path to potential glory as wide as possible.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: Origins was the start of a long-running and beloved series at BioWare, but it wasn't always meant to be. Former executive producer Mark Darrah, who worked for BioWare from 1998 through 2022, said that the game was conceived as a standalone story, and that you can still see that intent in some unresolved story threads.</p><p>"Dragon Age: Origins originally was intended as a standalone game," Darrah told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">MrMattyPlays</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-wasnt-meant-to-be-a-series-says-former-bioware-executive-producer-and-thats-why-origins-was-full-of-storylines-that-had-to-be-abandoned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "You can see this, if you play Dragon Age: Origins, knowing that it was intended to stand alone. There's a lot of threads that are cast out that kind of had to be abandoned because there could be werewolves all over the world, there might be a civil war happening underground in Orzammar." He said those elements were good for world-building but were difficult to deal with as an ongoing series.</p><p>Dragon Age became known as BioWare's fantasy series alongside the sci-fi Mass Effect. Both had ongoing stories that respected your earlier choices, including the ability to import your saves from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2 into the third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Or, you could customize a set of pre-set choices to build the world of Thedas to your liking. But accounting for all those choices in the third game meant that they could only be so impactful while still telling new original stories, because the studio hadn't counted on needing to pay off every decision from Origins into later games. Then Origins was a success, and the company was inclined to iterate with sequels.</p><p>"It's pretty much financial reasons more than anything," says Darrah. "And I think that the franchise has been much more forward-looking ever since then."</p><p>The latest game in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, had limited connections to previous games in the series, and didn't import saves from previous games or otherwise take your choices into account. It was mostly a standalone story, rather than one that accounted for all your previous adventures in Thedas. Darrah said that EA has pushed for Dragon Age to become more of a mainstream series.</p><p>"The problem that Dragon Age has had, charitably I guess, is that EA wants mainstream success," Darrah said, "and it's hard, or at least it has historically been hard, for corporate people, people who come from the sports side of the organization to look at a game like Dragon Age: Origins, which is super nerdy, not very attractive looking, and say 'Oh, this is a mainstream game.' They don't see it."</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was generally well-received, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 82 on Metacritic</a> and our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">GameSpot review calling it a return to form</a>. But the discourse online has been divisive, with some fans expressing disappointment with the lack of narrative choices and narrowly designed world.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly five years into the lifespan of the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles, many live-service games still support the previous generation's Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but the number is always at risk of dropping. Today, Krafton announced it would be the next developer to end support for those last-gen consoles, as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will no longer be supported on Xbox One and PS4 beginning November 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox One and PS4 support for PUBG will be shut off "during live server maintenance on November 13, 2025," according to the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow ">announcement post on PUBG's official website</a>.

"This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console. We kindly ask for your understanding."</p><p dir="ltr">The post also says that PUBG will no longer be downloadable or playable on the older systems, but that all progress made will be saved and carried over to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. PlayStation players will have to download and install the PS5-specific version of PUBG to play, while Xbox players will automatically upgrade to the Series X|S version via the Smart Delivery feature.</p><p dir="ltr">"The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience," the post explains.

                <p>Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, has issued a call to the developers of Roblox to "do more" to help protect children amid ongoing reports that the platform is not doing enough to safeguard young people from bad actors.</p><p>"There is a growing issue in our country with Roblox, an online gaming platform, and the abuse of children," Khanna said in a video posted to TikTok.

"We need to keep our kids safe online," he said.</p><p>"Roblox is at a crossroads," reads a line from the petition's website. "We're not going to stand by while kids are exploited online, and powerful tech companies can do more to stop it. We need Roblox to do more to protect children, provide more support to parents, and strengthen law enforcement protocols that help bring predators to justice.

                <p>Famously, parks full of monsters always work out well, right? Those things never like... get loose and wreak havoc on their captors, forcing them to deal with the morality (not to mention safety) of these decisions, do they? Okay cool, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> is making a second Tyranny Park.</p><p>Or at least, it's trying to. Helldivers 2's latest major order--a series of challenges for players to complete as a community--promises the erection of a new Tyranny Park for a hefty set of prices, including the liberation of a planet, the extermination of quite literally millions of the game's bug-like Terminid enemies, and more. Only then can Tyranny Park 2 be completed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1955557044976542126" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: The citizens of Super Earth have endured over a year of war, initiated and perpetuated by the enemies of Freedom.

It even calls back to the first Tyranny Park, which was the focus of an earlier Helldivers 2 initiative some months ago, citing its failure as a "tragic sabotage" whose lessons and victims will not be forgotten. I don't see how any of this could possibly go wrong.</p><p>This major order comes just as Helldivers 2 inches closer to its August 26 release on Xbox systems. Most recently, it's even begun to look like the developers are teasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-teases-halo-3-odst-crossover-ahead-of-its-xbox-launch/1100-6533858/" data-ref-id="1100-6533858">crossover with Halo 3: ODST</a> to celebrate the launch. It sounds to me like between this crossover and Tyranny Park 2, Helldivers 2 players will have a lot going on in the weeks to come.</p>

                <p>Superstar Mode has returned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a>, and it allows you to create your own player and go through the entire NFL experience. This includes the entire pre-draft process, which culminates with getting drafted by one of the 32 NFL teams. However, before you can get drafted, you need to participate in the NFL Combine. The Combine is meant to be a complete evaluation of you as a player, but it's not just your physical traits being tested. There's also a Combine interview where teams will ask you a series of questions, and you need to provide the correct answers.</p><p>While you can try to complete the interview by yourself, we have provided a list of every question and answer for the NFL Combine in the guide below. This lets you completely ace the test and get drafted highly in Madden 26's Superstar Mode.</p><h2>All NFL Combine answers in Madden 26</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289"></a><figcaption>Superstar Mode allows you to take over the NFL in Madden 26, and that starts at the Combine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg"></figure><p>In total, there are six questions you can be asked during the NFL Combine interview, but some of the questions are only for certain positions. You'll be asked five general questions plus a position-specific question for a total of six.</p><p>You also have a choice when it comes to your answers to the questions; specific answers will result in receiving different boosts and rewards in Superstar Mode. So, essentially, there's no wrong answer to a question, but you want to know which answer gives what reward so you can build your player the way you envision.</p><p>Below, we'll list all of the possible questions at the NFL Combine, their answers, and what rewards you earn for the answer you give.</p><h3>General NFL Combine questions and answers</h3><p><strong>It’s Super Bowl Week, and you witness your star teammate violating curfew, how do you handle it?</strong></p><ul><li>Say nothing, he’s his own man (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Tell the coaching staff (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li><li>Talk some sense into him (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li></ul><p><strong>How do you handle a teammate who criticizes the coaching staff to the media after a loss?</strong></p><ul><li>Have his back and tell the media I agree (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as an WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Tell the media I disagree (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li><li>Confront the coach at practice (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Say nothing, let the coaches handle it (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li></ul><p><strong>It’s the 4th quarter and the game is on the line.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was the series' long-anticipated trip to Japan, but it also made some significant changes to the series. Most notable for longtime fans was the absence of "social stealth," a series mainstay that allows your assassin to blend in with a crowd. But Ubisoft says it had good reason for the change, and reassured fans that social stealth could make a comeback.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bf6t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit AMA</a>, a trio of Ubisoft developers addressed a fan who asked about social stealth elements.</p><p>"For Shadows, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth," they said. "Tthat [sic] does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin's Creed franchise, though!"</p><p>Traditionally in an Assassin's Creed game, if a guard gives chase you could lose their sight line and then blend in with a group or sit on a bench to throw them off. In Shadows, however, the shinobi character Naoe would need to find cover or use her rope to climb out of sight to evade capture, rather than just duck behind a corner and look like she's minding her own business. That was only half the equation, too, as the game also featured a samurai character, Yasuke, who was functionally a walking tank. His massive size and ornate armor means he wouldn't exactly be inconspicuous in a crowd.</p><p>The last game before Shadows, Assassin's Creed Mirage, was an explicit throwback to the series' roots, including the setting and some older gameplay elements. It included the social stealth as usual, so it has been in recent memory for the Assassin's Creed series. The next Assassin's Creed game that we know of is codenamed Assassin's Creed Hexe--which may or may not be the final title--and it's reportedly set in 16th century Europe. As the name implies, it focuses on witchcraft and even lets you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-will-let-you-possess-and-control-a-cat-report/1100-6522899/" data-ref-id="1100-6522899">possess a cat</a>.</p>
