                <p>The Blue Shell is one of the most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-the-agony-and-the-anguish-of-the-blue-shell/1100-6506941/" data-ref-id="1100-6506941">iconic and divisive items</a> in all of Mario Kart, and with the release of Mario Kart World, fans are digging into new intricacies and strategies. It turns out MKW has introduced a new way to avoid the hated item. And unlike many other methods, this one doesn't require you to hold onto a specific item to pull it off.</p><p>Giant Bomb's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lqxay5ct5k2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb noted</a> that you can you can avoid the Blue Shell with a clever use of the new Rewind feature. Your kart simply rewinds a few seconds and the Blue Shell detonates in front of you, with plenty of space for you to swerve around it. That does make it a trade-off, since you'll lose a little ground by rewinding while the other racers will continue on--but it's much less of a penalty than getting hit by the shell, which also makes you lose all your items and momentum.</p><p>In our own testing, we found that you need to carefully time your use of the Rewind, because if you hit it too early, the shell will simply follow you backwards. But if you hit it just as the shell finishes its spin, you'll be safe. Best of all, since the Rewind can be triggered at any time, that gives you evergreen access to a way to avoid the Blue Shell.</p><p>Typically, most ways to avoid the Blue Shell require items, most notably the Super Horn or the Mushroom. This is one of those advanced strategies that should put players on an even playing field, and makes the Blue Shell much less daunting than it has been in the past.</p><p>For more guides on Mario Kart World, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532118/" data-ref-id="1100-6532118">how to unlock Rainbow Road</a>.</p>

                <p>Cows or Moo Moos have been a part of the Mario Kart franchise since 1996's Mario Kart 64. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-titled-mario-kart-9-because-nintendo-wants-to-take-the-series-to-the-next-level/1100-6531709/" data-ref-id="1100-6531709">Mario Kart World</a>--one of the launch titles for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/" data-ref-id="2900-6618">Switch 2</a>--is the first game in the series to feature a cow behind the wheel. And fans seem to love playing as Cow online.</p><p>Images and videos of players picking Cow have been shared all over social media (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/604129/mario-kart-world-cow-meme?taid=6841c615d752a100010a4204" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) since Mario Kart World debuted earlier this week.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PhillyBeatzU/status/1930775494116438512" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Anyone else’s online lobbies look like this in Mario Kart World?

There was an inordinate amount of interest in Cow after she was first spotted in the Mario Kart World teaser. Art director Masaaki Ishikawa subsequently revealed that the decision to turn Cow into a playable character <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">came from a silly drawing</a> one of his colleagues made while working on the game.</p><p>The Cow can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">eat burgers in MKW</a>, and she even hilariously seems to love it. That's led some to call her a cannibal, while others suggest that she's been eating a vegetarian meat substitute rather than consuming her own kind. Both of those theories may be overthinking the character a little bit. </p><p>Producer Kosuke Yabuki has acknowledged that Nintendo completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-is-a-bigger-hit-than-nintendo-imagined-may-not-be-a-cannibal/1100-6532020/" data-ref-id="1100-6532020">underestimated Cow's popularity</a>, but the company is happy with her reception. He also declined to weigh in about the cannibal or vegetarian theories.</p><p>Mario Kart World is out now on Switch 2, and you can keep picking Cow as long as you want to.</p>
