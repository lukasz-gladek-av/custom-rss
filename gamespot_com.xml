                <p dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-4-continues-the-original-games-story-after-15-years/1100-6533653/" data-ref-id="1100-6533653">officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic</a>, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay. The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time. We know the Four Horsemen are returning and picking up where they left off at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, but what else do we know about the fourth installment in the franchise? You can check out everything we know about Darksiders 4 in the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Darksiders 4 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">While we did get the reveal of Darksiders 4, THQ Nordic still has not given us a release date for the new action-RPG. Right now, the current release date is "to be announced," and there's no indication as to when an announcement is expected.</p><p dir="ltr">So, as of right now, we're pretty much in the dark when it comes to a release date for Darksiders 4. It's unclear how far along in development THQ Nordic is with the game, either, so we don't have anything to go on at the time of writing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Darksiders 4</h2><p dir="ltr">As we don't have a concrete release date for Darksiders 4, there's currently no way to preorder the game on any of its available platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S). This also means we don't know how much Darksiders 4 will cost. However, Darksiders has, in recent years, usually been priced under the industry standard for a new AAA game. For example, Darksiders III retailed for $40 at launch, and Darksiders Genesis came in at $30. THQ Nordic could take that same approach with Darksiders 4, which would put it at around $50-60, but it might also be a full-priced, $70 game.</p><p dir="ltr">All you can do right now is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203170?utm_source=thqnordic-next-darksiders4" rel="nofollow ">wishlist the game's Standard Edition on PC via Steam</a>. This gives you a notification when Darksiders 4 officially goes live for preorders.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Darksiders 4 teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want a small glimpse into what THQ Nordic has in store with Darksiders 4, you can watch the official teaser trailer for the action-RPG below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, this is only a sneak peek at the game that confirms the return of the Four Horsemen. We'll have to wait for a proper trailer to see exactly what Darksiders 4 will look like.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Darksiders is coming to PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's currently unknown if THQ Nordic will attempt to port the game to other platforms, such as Nintendo Switch 2, in the future. For now, though, Darksiders 4 will launch for only the current-gen platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Story, Setting, And Characters</h2><p dir="ltr">As we only have a small teaser trailer to go off, we don't know too much about the story of Darksiders 4. We do know that the game picks up at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, though, so the setting will still be the post-apocalyptic version of Earth that's remained prevalent throughout the franchise's life. The developers also said that the setting will take place over different realms within the post-apocalyptic landscape, and each realm has unique bosses, items, and visuals.</p><p dir="ltr">During the game, you'll get to play as one of the Four Horsemen characters, who have become staples of the franchise. Death, Strife, Fury, and War are back in Darksiders 4, and you can choose which one to play as for a playthrough. Each of the Horsemen features different weapons, abilities, and playstyles, giving you more replayability options for second, third, and fourth playthroughs of the main story.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the Four Horsemen, we're unsure of any additional characters in Darksiders 4. However, with the story starting from the end of the first game, it's a safe bet that some characters from the original will make an appearance.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Darksiders 4 Gameplay And Multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">While we await more details and showcases of Darksiders 4, the developers have given us an idea of how the game will play. Just like the other games in the series, the fourth installment is a third-person action-RPG that emphasizes combat, narrative storytelling, and exploration through a lore-rich world.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat in Darksiders 4 features up-close melee action and supernatural abilities that each of the characters possesses. These abilities can all likely be used in combat in some fashion, but other abilities could be more useful outside of engagements with enemies. In the case of Strife, we'll also likely be able to use his guns. Building on the cooperative feature in Genesis, it's also been confirmed that Darksiders 4 will support up to four people in cooperative play, with each controller one of the Four Horsemen.</p><p dir="ltr">THQ Nordic specifies "traversal and puzzle-solving" as key components to the game. Darksiders is no stranger to unique movement and puzzles across the post-apocalypse, but the early marketing seems to suggest those elements will play a larger role in Darksiders 4. Some characters might offer more traversal abilities than others, which could give them an edge while exploring the map, while other characters might have abilities that make them tankier in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">We still don't know a large chunk of how Darksiders 4 will look when it comes to gameplay, but THQ Nordic should be able to build off the foundation from the previous games in the franchise.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In early 2024, Disney invested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">more than a billion dollars in Fortnite creator Epic Games</a> and announced some sort of new Disney-powered metaverse experience. We've already seen a few aspects of this deal come to fruition, like Fortnite skins for the Incredibles and the Disney Villains, plus new Marvel and Star Wars-themed seasons. There's been <em>a lot</em> of Disney in Fortnite since that announcement, in other words.</p><p dir="ltr">But the big Disney x Fortnite metaverse mode has yet to see the light of day, and the project remains shrouded in mystery. Let's take a look at what we know about it so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What actually is the Disney x Fortnite mode?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't really know. There's been no teaser images or videos, and nobody is talking about it in terms that we would consider concrete. But here's how Disney described it in the <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-epic-games-fortnite/" rel="nofollow ">original announcement</a>:</p><p dir="ltr">"In addition to being a world-class games experience and interoperating with Fortnite, the new persistent universe will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more. Players, gamers and fans will be able to create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love."</p><p dir="ltr">While most of this is too nebulous to accurately break down with any real confidence, the key detail there is that Epic's new Disney experience is described as being its own thing that "interoperates" with Fortnite, rather than being a Fortnite mode. The reason for that distinction is that Disney x Fortnite will be its own walled garden of content--not every Fortnite skin will work with it, and there will be skins that work in the Disney mode that don't work in the rest of Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not every outfit will be able to do everything," Epic executive Saxs Persson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> in October 2024. "A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings."</p><p dir="ltr">In March 2025, meanwhile, a Disney Imagineer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/">speaking at South by Southwest</a>, indicated that Fortnite's Disney experience will have some interactivity with the Disney parks in the real world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Imagine ... what if you could go to the park and have an experience in Smuggler's Run [and] go on this amazing mission, but then have that affect or connect your gameplay at home?" said Asa Kalama, head of interactive experiences at Disney.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">OK, but what will the game/experience actually be like?</h2><p dir="ltr">Despite the quotes above, we still don't know anything really tangible about the moment-to-moment experience of this Fortnite x Disney thing. Yes, they've teased certain features, like being able to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1902845839380451462#fromHistory" rel="nofollow ">watch Disney content in-game or buy Disney merch,</a> and leaks indicate the experience will at least partially be set in some sort of <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1930318977080713575" rel="nofollow ">digital adaptation of the real-world Disneyland park</a>, and so perhaps you'll be able to ride those Disney rides in the game. And another leak mentions <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1948443719453298979" rel="nofollow ">cinematic cutscenes and story content</a>, so it may have a campaign to play through.</p><p dir="ltr">But even though we have this smattering of details about what will be included, we still have no real idea of what the core gameplay will be for this Fortnite x Disney thing. All these details are hints, but they don't add up to any sort of big picture.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When is Disney x Fortnite coming out?</h2><p dir="ltr">Considering how vague the details have been so far, there's no reason to expect this Disney x Fortnite project to release this year, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-has-concerns-about-upcoming-fortnite-project-report-says/1100-6533662/">a recent Wall Street Journal report</a> indicated it might be a while before it all comes together. The report claimed the mode is being held up by the many layers of Disney bureaucracy that have to approve anything Epic does with it. However, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney claimed the report was false and that Disney actually has been much more responsive than they expected.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of what is and isn't true with that story, the total lack of tangible info about the mode means there's no real reason to think that the Disney x Fortnite project is close to completion. Expect a 2026 launch at the earliest, unless Epic has majorly improved its ability to keep secrets recently.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Astro Bot is celebrating its 1-year anniversary today, September 6, 2025. Below, we reflect on what the plucky robot has come to represent for some burgeoning gamers.</em></p><p dir="ltr">More than 30 years ago, I fell in love. I was visiting extended family with my parents and two siblings, and the object of my affection was a boxy gray-and-black video game console hooked up to an equally boxy CRT television. I had seen video games before in arcades, and had played some rudimentary Mac games on our family computer. But Super Mario Bros. was something else entirely. The simple but flexible controls, the stage variety, the <em>music</em>. By the time we left my aunt's house, we three children were staging a coordinated influence campaign to convince our parents to buy our own Nintendo Entertainment System, eager to play more Mario. The rest is history.</p><p dir="ltr">My story isn't unique. Lots of children of the 1980s have similar origins for their gaming obsession. But now, decades later, as a parent myself, I'm struck by how Astro Bot has enraptured my own kids in ways that remind me of my experience with Mario. Years in the future, it will almost certainly be Astro that they credit with first igniting their love of games.</p><p dir="ltr">In my particular case, my experience with Mario all those years ago had a massive impact on the trajectory of my life. It affected not only my hobby and interests and circle of friends, but also my career. It's hard to imagine that I would have gone into writing about games professionally without catching the bug from an early age. I don't particularly think my own kids will become games critics, but it's a testament to how important these early experiences can be, and how they can manifest in unexpected ways.</p><div

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-face-of-playstation-and-the-technomagic-behind-astro-bot/1100-6526261/">extended hands-on</a>. It was a normal-enough studio visit, but I could sense an infectious energy around this game in particular. This was shaping up to be something special, and I think Asobi knew it. In interviews, game director Nicolas Doucet talked about how important it was to make this game appealing and approachable for younger gamers. Astro is a robot with a relatively simple character design, intentionally kept simple enough so that kids would be able to draw themselves. The character communicates wordlessly with expressions and sounds so that even kids who haven't yet learned to read will understand the story. The platforming stages are made to be tough enough to present a nice difficulty ramp for younger or novice players, with optional challenge stages for older and more experienced players.</p><p dir="ltr">"I remember the first few video games that I played, and because of how greatly they were designed, they stayed with me for my whole life," Doucet said. "And both of these are really important, I think. When we make something like a platformer, we have to be able to cater for both. So we've been building not only the game, but the culture of the team, always around that principle."</p><p dir="ltr">While Doucet didn't mention Mario specifically during the studio visit, the inspiration was clearly there. The studio set out to make a game that would feel great and have staying power.</p><p dir="ltr">They succeeded. A year later, Astro Bot is still one of the most-played video games in my house. My youngest, who can't read yet, usually calls it "the wobot game," but has started to know the character as Astro. The levels are just challenging enough to give him a satisfying sense of friction and accomplishment, while still remaining doable. He often surprises the rest of the family with how well he navigates even more challenging late-game stages.</p><p dir="ltr">My older kids are happy to play with him, helping him past the difficult parts, or playing their own extra-tough challenge levels. They all love to take on bosses together. They laugh and cheer each other on as they take on tougher challenges or replay their favorite stages. When one of the kids inadvertently deleted my 100% completion game save--I'm not naming names here; they know who they are--I ultimately shrugged it off because we could just start anew.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562846" data-ratio="0.56304985337243" data-width="1023" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562846"></a><figcaption>Astro TKOs Wako Tako</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4562846-scsiqh.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now to be sure, Astro Bot isn't likely to be as ubiquitous for my kids' generation as Mario was for mine. In the '80s, video game releases were sporadic and mascot characters were almost unheard of. Today, kids get into video games in all sorts of ways, from mobile devices and tablets to consoles, with massive, established franchises like Minecraft and Fortnite. Almost every gamer who came of age in the 1980s has a memory of Super Mario, but Astro's impact will be more diffused because there are more avenues leading to the same destination. Astro won't be a universal constant for its time period, and only time will tell if it has anywhere even remotely approaching Mario's staying power. Still, it will always be special to me for what it has meant in my household.</p><p>Astro Bot has enjoyed plenty of success over the last year. It has sold well, inspired merchandise (including multiple special-edition controllers), and won the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/">top honor at The Game Awards 2024</a>. For me, though, the impact has been more personal: Astro Bot is the game that unlocked a sense of curiosity and play in my kids, and sparked their interest in playing video games more broadly. When I see them playing it, it's like staring through a portal in time and watching myself all those years ago--face alight with the hypnotic glow of an old brown television, mouth agape as my mind reels at the possibilities of this magical new medium.</p>
