                <p>If there's one thing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bloodborne-review/1900-6416078/" data-ref-id="1900-6416078">Bloodborne</a> fans are clear on, it's that they want more Bloodborne. As nearly a decade has passed since its release and Sony has yet to revisit the franchise with another game, some indie developers have taken it upon themselves to make their own Bloodborne games. The latest unofficial Bloodborne game in development, Bloodborne: Top Down Arena, gives the title a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">Diablo-like action-RPG</a> makeover. While the project is far from finished, the game's creator, Maxime Foulquier, has posted a video that shows the gameplay in action.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS! I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena<br>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>  â€” Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As Foulquier noted in the tweet above, he originally had more ambitious plans to remake Bloodborne before he abandoned that out of fear of getting a cease-and-desist from Sony. The video features the Hunter fighting a few enemies, and it makes Bloodborne seem well suited for an entire game in this format.</p><p>Foulquier also <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that Bloodborne: Top Down Arena is different enough from the original Bloodborne to escape a takedown notice from Sony. That's why he doesn't plan to release it on Steam. He also acknowledged that another fan creation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-kart-is-releasing-soon-with-a-new-legally-distinct-name/1100-6522387/" data-ref-id="1100-6522387">Bloodborne Kart</a>, had to be delayed and completely reworked to avoid legal consequences from Sony. However, keeping the Bloodborne name on his own game may only invite Sony's lawyers to go after Foulquier as well.</p><p>Until Sony gets back around to Bloodborne, fan content may be the only way to get anything new. One of the most intriguing fan-made projects is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-graceborne-mod-brings-bloodborne-to-the-lands-between/1100-6524641/" data-ref-id="1100-6524641">Graceborne</a>, an Elden Ring mod that brings elements that originated in From Software's previous title into the developer's current franchise. That title is currently in its alpha stage.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-ii-tides-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-2298">Warcraft 2</a>: Remastered looks to be in the cards, as an "internal alpha" containing a logo and artwork was recently discovered on Blizzard's servers.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/warcraft-ii-remastered-internal-alpha-new-blizzard-catalog-entry-added-349660" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the leak comes from Blizzard's own CDN (content delivery network) servers. One of Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness' big innovations back in 1995 was its focus on naval and airborne combat, and the leaked internal alpha includes artwork showcasing a human warship sailing on a stormy sea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489"></a><figcaption>Leaked artwork for Warcraft 2: Remastered, via Wowhead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is currently gearing up for the Warcraft franchise's 30th anniversary, and will be hosting a livestream on November 13 to celebrate. The developer has stated the stream will have "something for everyone," including fans of the old Warcraft strategy games. There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">no BlizzCon this year</a>, so fans are expecting some big announcements normally reserved for Blizzard's annual fan convention to instead be made during the 30th anniversary-stream.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly makes it seem like Warcraft 2: Remastered will be announced during the livestream, but Blizzard so far has not officially announced the game. It wouldn't be the first classic Blizzard title to receive the remaster treatment, with Blizzard having previously remastered the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a> in 2017 as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a> in 2021 as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also, infamously, remastered one of the most beloved RTS games of all time with 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. Often hailed as Blizzard's first "bad game," the remaster for many fans wasn't what was originally promised, and in many ways felt like a step down from the original Warcraft 3. The reception to Warcraft 3: Reforged was so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-expands-refund-requests-for-warcraft-3-re/1100-6473492/" data-ref-id="1100-6473492">Blizzard offered "no-questions asked" refunds</a>, with a later report stating the game was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-a-victim-of-mismanagement-pressure-from-activision-and-budget-cuts-report/1100-6494287/" data-ref-id="1100-6494287">victim of budget cuts and mismanagement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is evidence to suggest Blizzard may be giving Warcraft 3: Reforged a redo as well. A Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-might-be-floating-a-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/1100-6510801/" data-ref-id="1100-6510801">survey asking players about a potential Reforged relaunch</a> last year generated headlines. Last month, the game's public test realm servers briefly showed an unannounced 2.0 build before being removed several hours later, but nothing has been officially announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Not content to wait for an official Blizzard remaster, fans have already taken to updating Warcraft 2 for the modern age. One fan project, called Warcraft: Chronicles of War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-warcraft-2-fan-remake-using-warcraft-3-reforged-is-available-now/1100-6520147/" data-ref-id="1100-6520147">reimagines Warcraft 2 using Warcraft 3: Reforged's engine</a>. Its Horde campaign is currently playable for free for those who already own Reforged.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans wait for more news during the 30th anniversary-livestream, Blizzard has offered a number of ways to celebrate the franchise across its various games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Warcraft-themed skins in Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's latest update is almost entirely centered around the game's 20th anniversary, letting players tackle "Timewalking" versions of original WoW dungeons and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">earn updated versions of some of the game's most iconic armor sets</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has commented on the possibility of acquiring more companies, saying that while it is considering all options, the Mario maker would prefer to "organically expand" instead.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings announcement</a>, the company said "we do not rule out the possibility of further mergers and acquisitions." At the same time, though, Nintendo said its priority is on the aforementioned organic expansion, and for a good reason.</p><p>Nintendo said organic expansion allows new staff to "fully learn and understand our creative culture," whereas this might be more challenging if Nintendo simply bought a company outright.</p><p>Nintendo has made a number of acquisitions since 2021, including Next Level Games, SRD, and Shiver in the world of game development.

It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms."</p><hr><h2>Final Fantasy XVI Poster Collection</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395304"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 16: poster Collection</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395304-ff16-poster-collection.jpg"></figure><p>If you're already a fan, you can also check out some extra Final Fantasy 16 content through these deluxe art and poster books. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XVI-Poster-Collection/dp/1646092759?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Final Fantasy 16 Poster Collection book</a> contains 33 large-format and full-color art prints that have been printed on press-varnished card stock, making them ready to frame.

                <p dir="ltr">Last year at The Game Awards, Sega announced new entries in multiple franchises within their backlog, including Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, and Streets Of Rage. Today, one of the company's executives confirmed that another classic Sega franchise will be punching its way back into the limelight, as a new Virtua Fighter has been confirmed to be in active development.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, Justin Scarpone--executive VP and head of Sega's Global Transmedia Group--confirmed the existence of a new Virtua Fighter alongside the other legacy Sega franchises mentioned previously. No other details on the upcoming project, or whether it will be part of a larger transmedia strategy--like Shinobi, another legacy IP, which has a game in development and a movie in production--were confirmed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395479"></a><figcaption>Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown (2021)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket, which we announced last year at The Game Awards," Scarpone said. "Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and we have another Virtua Fighter being developed. And so all thatâ€™s very exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming the new game is not a reboot or remake, the new Virtua Fighter would be the sixth entry in the fighting franchise, which ushered in a new era of 3D-based fighters when it debuted in 1993. The most recent game, Virtua Fighter 5, first launched for home consoles in 2007 before being remastered in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega's transmedia strategy began with the successful release of the Sonic The Hedgehog movie in 2020--with the third film in that series set for release next month. Other recent Sega releases include the Yakuza: Like A Dragon series on Amazon Prime Video, Sonic X Shadow Generations on consoles and PC, and Metaphor: ReFantazio from the Atlus wing of the company.</p>

Stolz-Zwilling said Warhose had "some discussions" about utilizing DRM to protect the game from piracy, but it was ultimately decided that "it will not have any DRM system at all."</p><p>Stolz-Zwilling said he hopes this brings closure to the ongoing questions from the community about whether or not Deliverance 2 will have DRM.</p><p>"Stop texting under every post we do that Denuvo is in the game, because it's not.

But that isn't actually going to be the case.</p><p>Many publishers and developers use Denuvo and other anti-piracy software to attempt to prevent people from pirating copies of a game at launch. Eventually, basically all games get cracked over time, but tools like Denuovo make it more difficult for people to do so. Denuvo specifically has been controversial because some PC players claim the software negatively affects game performance, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this may not be true</a>.</p><p>Deliverance 2 launches in February 2025 for PC, as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The open-world RPG takes place during the Middle Ages. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-evolved-without-sacrificing-its-heart/1100-6526012/" data-ref-id="1100-6526012">aims to be</a> more approachable in both story and gameplay without compromising any of the elements that resonated with the first game's hardcore fans.</p><p>2018's Kingdom Come: Deliverance was funded in part on Kickstarter and went on to become a huge success, selling <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1853489512233480418" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than eight million copies.</a> Daniel Vavra, known for his work on the Mafia series, directed the original Kingdom Come and its sequel. </p>
