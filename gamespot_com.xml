The best map for getting started, especially for beginners, is the Liberty Falls map. Here we'll explain how to gain access to the Pack-a-Punch machine, as well as the costs associated with those upgrades for your weapons.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find and unlock the Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch</h2><p dir="ltr">When starting a match on Liberty Falls, the Pack-a-Punch machine will be on the opposite end of the gas station rooftop where you'll spawn. This will take some time to earn enough points to access the area you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also more than one path you can take, with doors to unlock on the left and right side of your starting area, but we recommend choosing the right side. This will give you quicker access to the most essential perks of Juggernog and Quick Revive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067" data-ratio="0.56277056277056" data-width="1848" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls cemetery barrier </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 1:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spend the 1,500 essence points needed to unlock the right-side barrier.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 2: </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Head behind Ollie's Comic Shop to unlock the second barrier needed. This is 1,750 essence points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 3:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Follow the street leading up the hill to the church. This will include a barrier for 2,000 essence points to unlock access to the church front and cemetery.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 4:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The front entrance to the church is also locked, so it will cost you 2,250 essence points to open this final barrier to the church.</p><p dir="ltr">You can now enter and find the Pack-a-Punch machine at the back of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also helpful to note that Black Ops 6 finally <strong>allows players to share the costs of opening doors</strong>. You can choose to pay a portion of the barrier costs, and other teammates can chip in as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Pack-a-Punch costs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Upgrading the power of your weapon with the Pack-a-Punch machine is a hefty price. There are three tiers of upgrades, which are priced as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Tier 1 costs 5,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 2 costs 15,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 3 costs 30,000 essence points</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Playing solo, you should be able to unlock access to Pack-a-Punch and get a tier-one upgrade by level 9.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Arsenal machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also upgrade your weapon's rarity by adding more attachments. This rarity upgrade is applied at any of the map's Arsenal machines. There's an Arsenal machine at the end of the street on the right side, which is just beyond where you open the first barrier. There's another Arsenal machine in the parking lot opposite the church.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades are paid for with the salvage currency dropped by fallen zombies. The costs are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">500 for Common (Green)</li><li dir="ltr">1,000 for Rare (Blue)</li><li dir="ltr">3,500 for Epic (Pink)</li><li dir="ltr">8,500 for Legendary (Orange)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out all the details on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/">player progression and prestige work</a>.
