                <p>Call of Duty's next big update, Season 5, arrives soon, and with it comes the newest BlackCell bundle. For anyone just catching up, BlackCell bundles are Call of Duty's high-end store offerings. Priced at $30, the BlackCell bundles include exclusive items that make your character stand out, and the new Season 5 bundle is no different.</p><p>The centerpiece of the Season 5 BlackCell bundle is the new operator, Solace. He's described as "the living embodiment of good," whose mission is to "stamp out evil and adversaries alike with both divine strength" and a griffin that can be summoned as part of a finishing move.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540359-screenshot2025-07-29at1.58.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540359" data-ratio="0.55853314527504" data-width="709" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540359-screenshot2025-07-29at1.58.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540359"></a><figcaption>Introducing the Season 5 BlackCell operator, Solace. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540359-screenshot2025-07-29at1.58.22pm.png"></figure><p>Purchasing the new Season 5 BlackCell bundle provides access to BlackCell-exclusive pages of the Season 5 battle pass.

Weber replied, "I'm like, 'Yeah, how are we going to do that?'"</p><p>Weber went on to tell <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/senior-the-witcher-4-dev-admits-hes-a-little-worried-about-making-an-rpg-better-than-the-witcher-3-but-he-knows-that-this-stuff-is-subjective-and-doesnt-see-video-games-as-mathematical/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that a video game, like any creative endeavor, is "subjective," so instead of trying to outdo The Witcher 3, the team is trying to do justice to The Witcher 3 by embracing the vibes of how the game was made. He said the studio wants to "take the philosophy we had during The Witcher 3--how to make a game, how to really care about these things, how to tell stories--and keep that philosophy."</p><p>The Witcher 4 is a "true sequel," so CD Projekt Red will also trying to answer "new questions." Otherwise, The Witcher 4 runs the risk of "just redoing what we did before," Weber said.</p><p>"I think it's really trying to have that healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," he said.</p><p>Before this, Weber said when the team was making The Witcher 3, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-wants-studio-to-harness-the-scrappy-energy-that-made-witcher-3-so-successful/1100-6532438/" data-ref-id="1100-6532438">"good creative chaos"</a> going on at the studio. In practice, what this meant was that developers were working in a "vibe-based" manner and getting stuff done even if it was outside of their specific job remit.</p><p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!'" Weber said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt. Some of the others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>The Witcher 4 focuses its story on Ciri, and this has generated some amount of debate and controversy. Some people are calling the game "woke," but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">Geralt's voice actor has slammed these critics.</a> In other news, a new tech demo for the game debuted earlier this year, and while it looked very impressive, the developers want people to know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">it wasn't actually the game.</a></p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG has had a consistently solid player population for months, the mode has been overshadowed by both Reload and Blitz--and so it's only to be expected that Epic would try some new stuff to shake things up. This past weekend's live rocket event has seemingly ushered in the first of these changes, which could be taking the island in a new direction with the mysterious red rifts. And with this latest patch, OG got a retro matchmaking mode with no skill-based matchmaking and no bots.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">OG Duos just went Expert mode!<br>Wanna put your skills to the test? Expert mode has old school matchmaking rules where anyone and everyone could be in your lobby! Good luck ;)</p>  — Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>To try out this new version of OG, just select the standard OG mode (<em>not</em> Zero build), and click the group-size dropdown menu, where you'll find a new option at the bottom for Duo (Expert). And don't worry: the regular Duo mode is still available for folks who don't want to wade into this sweatfest.</p><p>While the removal of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) will be celebrated by some, the net effect of its removal is that people who just started playing Fortnite could be matched against pro gamers--which is the reason pro gamers often clamor to get rid of SBMM. This dynamic tends to be less thrilling for normal players, though, who have a better time when they're <em>not</em> constantly being matched with players who have a much higher skill level than they do.</p><p>In this case, however, the removal of SBMM and bots is actually more of a nostalgia play, because Fortnite didn't have either of those things during Chapter 1. So this sort of matchmaking change brings OG more in line mechanically with what it really was back in the day.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is easily one of the best-looking games of the year, and it looks like it's convincing enough to fool Reddit and Discord's age-checking programs. Over in the UK, new online safety rules went live and now require several platforms to verify the age of its various users there. Brits have been getting around that system using a variety of tricks, and as one Dany Sterkhov noted, pretending to be Sam Porter Bridges is a reliable way to trick the system.</p><p>Like other PlayStation first-party games, Death Stranding 2 has a robust photo mode that allows you to easily and quickly strike a pose with the game's protagonist, who is played by actor Norman Reedus. Game director Hideo Kojima used a sophisticated photography rig made up of dozens of cameras to capture every minute detail of the real-life people who provided their likeness for the game's characters, and with photo mode open in Death Stranding 2, simply pointing your smartphone at your display is enough to bypass the security systems.</p><p>What makes this even more impressive is that even if you're asked to make certain facial expressions, you can do that in Death Stranding 2's photo mode easily. As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Discord and Reddit use their own separate age verification systems, and fooling both of them was remarkably easy. Meanwhile, the UK Government is facing quite a bit of criticism over the introduction of these measures, and it refuses to repeal the Online Safety Act even in the face of petitions that have almost 400,00 people calling for it to be rolled back (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/the-uk-government-say-it-has-no-plans-to-repeal-the-online-safety-act-in-response-to-380-000-strong-and-counting-petition/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>In other Death Stranding 2 news, more interesting details were revealed about the game and player behavior. Kojima tweeted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/" data-ref-id="1100-6533497">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>--got to get those five-star SSS connections!--and that people really loved to rescue kangaroos in the post-apocalyptic outback.</p>
