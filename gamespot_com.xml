                <p dir="ltr">Indie developer Night Dial has just released its latest horror game, titled "Crowded. Followed." The game sees players step into the shoes of an unnamed protagonist who stumbles across a disturbed, dying man in the middle of what seems to be a massive street party. The man urges the player to take a (rather diseased-looking) briefcase from him, warning them that the briefcase will cause them to be followed by an unknown entity.</p><p dir="ltr">From the looks of the trailer, the game's plot appears quite similar to that of 2014's It Follows, a horror film about a woman who is haunted by a cursed, evil force that follows her through life, often taking on the appearance of other people.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyDjc2iO7AM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qyDjc2iO7AM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"This thingâ€¦ it may take the form of someone else," the man on the ground tells the protagonist as a creepy, ghoulish creature resembling a very tall <a href="https://thering.fandom.com/wiki/Samara_Morgan" rel="nofollow ">Samara</a> rounds the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">As the title suggests, Crowded. Followed. sees players fighting to hold onto the briefcase and navigate their way through winding streets, busy metropolitan areas, and a huge party at a club, all while being relentlessly stalked by the unnamed shapeshifter. Interestingly, the protagonist can be seen clutching an asthma inhaler at various points in the trailer, suggesting players may have to contend with medical issues in addition to the whole "sleep paralysis demon wants my briefcase" thing.</p><p>Night Dial's latest analog horror title takes about 60 - 90 minutes to complete, making it a great title to try out for horror-lovers who don't have 18-25 hours to devote to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/">the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. Crowded. Followed. is wallet-friendly, too--the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948790/CROWDED_FOLLOWED/" rel="nofollow ">currently available on Steam</a>, where it can be purchased for $6 USD (though it's currently on sale for $5.39). A free demo is also available for download.</p>
