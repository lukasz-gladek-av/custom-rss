                <p>Sega has announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, and it's not coming to PlayStation 5--at least not right away. The new version is coming for Xbox Series X|S and PC, but there is no word yet on a potential release for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The game launches on June 10, and it'll be available through Xbox Game Pass. On PC, people can buy it through Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YxYLWIJfP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7YxYLWIJfP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Given the day-one launch for Game Pass, some are theorizing that Microsoft might have cut a deal with Sega for this. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-cod-under-microsoft-wont-try-to-do-slimy-platform-things/1100-6524115/" data-ref-id="1100-6524115">trying to give players a choice about where they play their games</a>, as opposed to doing "slimy platform things to force you to do what I want." Space Marine is a Sega-published game, however.</p><p>The game, developed by Relic Entertainment, was originally released in 2011 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. The new Master Crafted edition marks the first time Space Marine will be playable on any Xbox other than Xbox 360 because it never came to the backwards-compatible program for newer Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Master Crafted edition is developed by SneakyBox and features 4K resolution, modernized controls, an overhaul to the interface, improved character models, and remastered audio. Producer Vaidas Mikelskas told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the game "isn't just a technical upgrade--it's a thoughtful restoration."</p><p>Space Marine 2 followed in 2024, and Space Marine 3 is now in the works.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the big announcements from the recent Warhammer Skulls event in the gallery below.</p>

                <p>When you're running a respectable drug empire in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596"> Schedule 1</a>, space quickly becomes limited as you race to fill the available real estate with grow setups,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-mixing-and-recipes-guide/1100-6530964/" data-ref-id="1100-6530964"> mixing stations</a>, and packing stations. Maximizing your income is the real aim of the game here, so that leaves precious little space for the horde of employee beds required to get a little help with labor. Now, in its open beta, Schedule 1 will no longer require employees to be registered to beds.</p><p>Instead, you'll be able to place a locker, which has a much smaller footprint, and removes the possibility of employee pathways becoming entangled, leading to some very confused, and very stuck, NPCs. Solo developer TVGS does mention in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546735912086667480?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes </a>that existing employees will still need to be assigned to beds for "compatibility reasons" but that any new employees can use lockers instead.</p><p>Of course, the obvious solution is to fire everyone, remove their beds, place lockers, and rehire them--if you can be bothered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499701"></a><figcaption>Schedule 1 employees now take up far less space.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499701-scheduleireleasetrailer0-5screenshot.png"></figure><p>This beta includes the save file consolidation changes mentioned in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-patch-notes-introduce-a-new-feature-useful-to-all-players/1100-6531398/" data-ref-id="1100-6531398">last set </a>of patch notes, which means that NPCs and properties save under a single file, reducing the time saves take, and improving Steam cloud-syncing functionality.</p><p>Alongside these adjustments, the new storage unit can now house three employees, meaning efficiency is on the rise. Trash cans will now show the area they apply to as you're placing them down, too.</p><p>As well as a host of bug fixes, item-slot filters have also been added to the game. This means that certain slots on storage shelves can have specific items blacklisted, so your perfectly organized farmhouse will no longer descend into chaos when left in the hands of your employees.</p><p>Rounding off the patch notes, TVGS says that an in-game voting system is in the works, with the first vote likely to commence next week. Here, you can vote on which features you'd like to see in the next major update. Those features are "likely" to be a cartel update, a police expansion, or the addition of Shrooms to manufacturable products.</p><p>These updates are only on the beta branch of the game. To access it, right-click Schedule 1 in your Steam inventory and select properties. Then, click "betas" and select the "beta" branch. As some of these features are experimental, make sure to back up your save before changing over.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed four new games coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library today, May 23. They are Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirbys-star-stacker/" data-ref-id="5000-6379">Kirby Star Stacker</a> is the highest-profile addition. Originally released by HAL Laboratory in 1997, it is a puzzle game with gameplay similar to Tetris Attack or Pokemon Puzzle League. Players have to match blocks that look like Rick, Coo, and Kine from Kirby's Dream Land 2. The Super Famicom version of this game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-brings-three-games-to-us-for-first-time-ever/1100-6517513/" data-ref-id="1100-6517513">came to Nintendo Switch Online in 2023</a>, but now the original release also has a place as part of Nintendo's subscription service.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRmpwGGTXOo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/survival-kids-1999/" data-ref-id="5000-11627">Survival Kids</a> is another notable inclusion this month because it's a Konami franchise about to be reimagined for Nintendo Switch 2. The original Survival Kids is a cult classic that tasks players with surviving on a deserted island. If you enjoy modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a>, they owe a lot to games like Survival Kids that helped trailblaze some of the genre's mechanics. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of Survival Kids looks like a lighthearted, cooperative reinterpretation of the series' formula, it's nice to have the rare Game Boy original available through Switch Online now.</p><p>Game Boy enthusiasts will also enjoy the other two games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault/" data-ref-id="5000-15933">Gradius: The Interstellar Assault</a> is a solid Game Boy version of Konami's classic arcade shoot 'em up. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sword-of-hope/" data-ref-id="5000-16075">The Sword of Hope</a> is an ambitious but lesser-known RPG for Nintendo's handheld console.</p><p>Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope all now available to play through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

The clip here is only 40 seconds long and it contains brand-new footage, but don't get too hyped up unless you're a fan of post-apocalyptic environmental ASMR.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRutwoEyG3s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRutwoEyG3s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In case you can't click the video above, all you're missing out on is a brief clip of an open prepper shelter waiting for a brave deliveryman to come pick up some cargo. At the very least, it's a nice look at the more arid terrain that you'll be able to explore in Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Beyond that tissue-pack marketing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a>. This model features a sleek black finish and insignia based on the fictional Drawbridge company in the sequel, and it's priced at $85. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2 releases for PS5 on June 26</a>, and several previews for the game recently went live.</p><p>While feedback has been mostly positive so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/">game director Hideo Kojima isn't satisfied</a> and he wants to see a few "controversial" opinions about the sequel.</p><p>"I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While the current Switch doesn't ask for a phone number for voice chat, a separate mobile device is still needed to talk with friends through the Nintendo Switch Online app. This will eventually get renamed to the Nintendo Switch app sometime this month and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/">where you find Zelda Notes</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the enhanced Switch 2 Editions</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, a report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/">GameChat including a couple of helpful accessibility features</a>: text-to-chat speech functionality and live chat translation. However, both were showcased in Japanese, so it's unknown officially what languages may be supported on the upcoming system.</p><p>Switch 2 is set to launch on June 5 for $450, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">preorders sold out</a> almost immediately. That said, Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">Doug Bowser believes the company can meet demand for the console</a> throughout the rest of this year.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, May 23, 2025. Below, we look back at how its villains were unusually sympathetic, lending weight to the story.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's one of the most haunting scenes in any Fire Emblem game. A soldier and temporary king, Orson, is seen talking with the reanimated corpse of his wife, Monica. She only says one thing--"darling"--over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson, one of the many antagonists in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-review/1900-6126647/">Fire Emblem Sacred Stones</a>, was a man devoted to Monica long before the campaign of the game began. He's only present during a short part of the story, but he leaves a major impression once the credits roll after the game's 30 chapters come to a close. While you'll first meet him as a playable character, he eventually betrays Ephraim, Eirika, and the other heroes in order to (as he believes) save his wife's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though this story plays out solemnly on a 2.5 inch Game Boy screen, it packs a punch that remains one of the most memorable parts of Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones. Orson's tale, along with those of the other villains in Sacred Stones, exemplifies the type of personal story that sets the Fire Emblem series apart from other strategy games. It provides a personal, intimate look at enemies before we fight them on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LmocGJOdZk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9LmocGJOdZk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Orson's betrayal comes as a shock. When the idea of a turncloak hiding in Eirika and Ephraim's forces is brought up by an enemy commander, it's not immediately clear who he's referring to. We find out when Orson tries to trick Eirika into handing over one of the keys to the games namesake, the sacred stones, while leading her right into the hands of the enemy. Then, he's dismissed and nearly disappears from the story.</p><p dir="ltr">We see him nine chapters later in a terrible state, living for nothing but the reanimated corpse of his wife. We witness brief scenes where he brings her gifts and lashes out at the people around him for the mere act of interrupting their time alone. These moments are short, intimate looks at an unwound man who has forsaken everything in his life for the memory of his love. Our last look at Orson comes from combat dialogue right before he is killed.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the one I love, I betray everything," Orson tells Eirika before they cross swords near the halfway point of Sacred Stone's campaign. "My country, my lord and master… everything."</p><p dir="ltr">While few would endorse his actions, it's easy to understand why Orson made them. Laying the scene out before us--as unsettling as it is--puts him in the spotlight as if he was one of the games' protagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">We get a similarly personal look at Lyon, the prince of Grado who serves as the secondary antagonist in Sacred Stones, that gives plenty of weight to his villainy. Like Orson, one of Lyon's primary drivers is saving someone close to him through experimentation with dangerous magic. He uses the sacred stone, which is a seal that helps contain a powerful demon, to push healing magic, which isn't known to help with grievous injuries in the world of Sacred Stones, further than it's ever been pushed before.</p><p dir="ltr">"If I can just press my studies a little harder [...] I think I might be able to use it to heal my father’s illness," Lyon says at one point in the story. "If that works, there’s no telling how many other people I can help as well."</p><p dir="ltr">As you might have guessed, Lyon's experimentations backfire. He eventually loses control and is influenced by the demon sealed through the sacred stones, before being finally convinced that the only way to prevent a cataclysmic event is to free the demon.</p><p dir="ltr">We see the backstory of Lyon's father sickness, his childhood relationships with Ephraim and Eirika, and his struggles with his poor health and lack of self-confidence throughout the game. Flashbacks, combat dialogue, and story sequences lay out the motivations of a ruler in complete despair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303" data-ratio="0.66701461377871" data-width="958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303"></a><figcaption>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Getting such a sincere look at the villain's perspective is one way to convince us that Ephraim and his army aren't just cutting down evil, faceless enemies. The scenes with Orson and Lyon throughout the campaign overshadow the fantastical demonic villain that enters the fray later on.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem is a franchise that wants you to care about the units you fight with and against. You're not sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, you're sending characters that you've recruited, trained with, leveled up, and grown closer to over the course of the game. It's not uncommon for fans of the series to abort missions and start over as soon as one of their heroes falls on the battlefield. The thought of going on without them is too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Sacred Stones exemplifies this part of the franchise. Moulder, a gentle priest who acts as a father figure to other units and Joshua, a talented swordsman with an unhealthy obsession with gambling, are just two of the 30 units that you can learn about as you watch them interact with one another before each mission. Building out your go-to squad is like choosing which friends you want to spend time with over the course of the games' story.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson and Lyon--villains that are only roadblocks in the path to the game's main demonic antagonist--serve as sobering examples of villains who are tragically relatable. We see why they do what they do firsthand, giving them just as much of a story as any other character in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Later Fire Emblem games have built on what entries like Sacred Stones established for the franchise. Fire Emblem: Engage and Fire Emblem: Three Houses gave us more ways to build relationships with our soldiers on the field. Few games, however, have given us an equally as disturbing look into what would drive good people to commit horrible crimes.</p>

A global Go Fest event is scheduled to follow June 28-29, and like previous years, there will be rotating habitats with different Pokemon, event-themed Research tasks to complete, and various other in-game bonuses. Players who purchase a ticket for the event will also receive an exclusive Special Research story that leads to an encounter with the mythical Pokemon Volcanion.</p>

"Guns are upgradable in Firebreak, but we now think we went too far with how weak they felt at the earliest levels," Kyatta said. "In response, we are making all level-one guns radically more powerful, while adjusting other parts of the game to maintain the challenge balance."</p>

<p>Kyatta added that it heard from players that the double-barrel shotgun did not feel quite right, and the studio agrees, so it's making some changes to "make sure it meets the expectations of its shooting style." The developer also mentioned how "everything" related to general combat intensity and difficulty levels has been overhauled. "Among other things, we're tying different enemy types to different threat levels, adjusting wave frequency and composition, and removing awkward lulls in the action," Kyatta said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Kyatta said Remedy has added "dynamic tutorials" to the game to help players have a "clear path forward without limiting them from discovering alternate ways of going about things."</p><p>Additionally, Kyatta mentioned how the "visual clarity" of FBC wasn't quite right. "The chaos stops being fun when players can no longer make meaningful decisions based on what they're experiencing." With that in mind, Remedy is spending time "cleaning up and reducing a lot of effects in the game, both on-screen and in-world."</p><p>What's more, Kyatta said it was a known issue that the general in-game audio was too quiet in the early tests. The studio is now putting together the final audio mix for the game that should address this.</p><p>Finally, Kyatta said Remedy continues to work on "performance testing and improvements" for PC, which is why the minimum and recommend PC specs have not been announced yet. "We'll share those results as soon as we're confident in them," Kyatta said.</p><p>"We've still got a lot to do to make the launch experience the best it can be, but the team is feeling really good about where we are," he added.</p><p>FBC officially launches on June 17, and it's included as a day-one launch title for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Alternatively, it can be purchased outright for $40 for console and PC.</p>

                <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has dropped its case against Microsoft that sought to block the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The deal was already approved, but the FTC was appealing the decision.</p><p>A memo from the FTC states that, "The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case.
