                <p>It's been over 5 years since Rare's in-development project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-everything-we-know/1100-6503918/" data-ref-id="1100-6503918">Everwild</a> was announced by Xbox, and details have been thin on the ground ever since. In a recent interview, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that Everwild is proceeding well.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/16/xboxera-podcast-episode-250/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, Spencer mentioned a few games in passing that he's excited for. Everwild was one of those games, with Spencer confirming that Rare is making "progress" on the project. "I do think the work that Double Fine's doing and how [Double Fine founder Tim Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team," Spencer said in part. "And the other one, I'll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Spencer also mentioned State of Decay 3 as part of the same section, with the Xbox boss calling the series "one that I love." Later in the interview, Spencer said that studios like Rare are allowed more time to make long-in-the-oven games like Everwild because Xbox's current slate is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-has-more-games-slated-for-ps5-this-year-than-sony-so-far/1100-6529489/" data-ref-id="1100-6529489">packed with games</a>. He also indicated that the next studio he's going to visit is The Coalition, the stewards of the Gears of War franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Everwild is one of those "missing games" that it's easy to forget about, given that it was first announced in 2019, even before the start of the current console generation. A 2022 report suggests that the project was internally rebooted following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/" data-ref-id="1100-6483926">the departure</a> of the game's creative director Simon Woodroffe back in 2020. Everwild's current director is Gregg Mayles, a Rare veteran who worked on games like Sea of Thieves, Viva Pinata, and Banjo-Kazooie. We still have no word on a potential release date for Everwild.</p>

Talking along with Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, the two chatted with an audience about their doubts about their creative process.</p><p>After taking a few pre-submitted audience questions, one came across which asked about the development of sequels and how to maintain character development over multiple games. Druckmann said he goes one game at a time and doesn't think that far ahead.</p><p>"That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games because I'm the game in front of us is so all-consuming," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he responded (via IGN)</a>. "I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, 'what if I never get to do another one?' I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here."</p><p>Druckmann expanded on how his method for character arcs works which simply boiled down to if they can't move forward, he said he jokingly would kill them off.</p><p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'," he explained.</p><p>"And we have to come up with a new answer," he continued. "And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?”</p><p>Speaking of new, back in November, Druckmann confirmed during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion--appearing alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine--that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-hes-been-working-on-new-game-since-2020-and-that-makes-sense/1100-6527766/" data-ref-id="1100-6527766">he was working on his first new game since 2020</a>.</p><p>"I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said at the time.</p><p>Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us premieres on Max in April and will cover some of the events The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

                <p>Sony's big push into the live-service market has been hit and miss, and the company is continuing to invest in the space with the next game from former Assassin's Creed boss Jade Raymond. Her team at the PlayStation-owned Haven Studios is making a heist-themed competitive game for PS5 and PC called Fairgame$--and yes, it's really styled that way.</p><p>Described as a "fresh, modern take on the heist genre," Fairgame$ aims to be a competitive heist game where people steal from the rich to "rebalance the scales" in a society where billionaires hold an increasingly large share of the wealth. While the game was conceived of years ago, this setup is certainly something that remains topical today.</p><p>Not much has been said or shown of the game, but there have been some details released so far, which we're compiling together in this post.</p><h2 id="When_will_Fairgame__be_released_"><strong>When will Fairgame$ be released?</strong></h2><p>Fairgame$ was announced in 2023 but was not given a release date, or window, at the time or since then. Recently, however, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-ps5-live-service-title-fairgame-has-reportedly-slipped/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb</a> reported that the game slipped internally and is now tentatively set for release in 2026.</p><p>Fairgame$ is the debut title from Haven Studios. As for Raymond, she's had a turbulent career after leaving Ubisoft. She<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-ea-assassins-creed-boss-joins-google-ahead-/1100-6465543/" data-ref-id="1100-6465543"> joined Google in 2019 to head up a new internal game team</a>, but in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-is-shutting-down-its-game-studios-impacting-150-people-including-jade-raymond/1100-6486978/" data-ref-id="1100-6486978">Google closed its game studios and Raymond departed.</a> In 2021, she founded Haven. Sony bought the company in 2022.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Fairgame_"><strong>Preorder Fairgame$</strong></h2><p>Fairgame$ is not yet available to preorder. In fact, we don't even know if it's going to be paid game at all.</p><h2 id="Fairgame__trailer"><strong>Fairgame$ trailer</strong></h2><p>The debut trailer for Fairgame$ was striking and impressive, but it didn't have any gameplay footage. Instead, the CG trailer was focused on setting the mood and tone for the game, which involves stealing from the rich as part of a heist-themed multiplayer experience. Check out the trailer below.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="34606091" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Sony doesn't bring its single-player games to PC simulataneously with PS5, but it does do that for live-service games. As such, Fairgame$ would be expected to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026"> launch at the same time across PS5 and PC.</a></p><h2 id="Fairgame__story__setting__and_characters">Fairgame$ story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Creative director Mathieu Leduc said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-fairgame-a-competitive-heist-experience-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that Haven was founded with the goal of making games that its staffers wanted to play, and that's why the team chose a competitive multiplayer game.</p><p>"Fairgame$ came from a desire to create a new type of PvP game with emergent sandbox gameplay. We want to deliver a fresh multiplayer experience that rewards creativity and mastery and delivers surprising stories each and every time you play," Leduc said.</p><p>"In a nutshell, this is a thrilling competitive heist game where you join an underground movement to rob the ultra-rich and rebalance the scales," Leduc said.</p><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2 id="What_s_going_on_with_Sony_s_live_service_push_"><strong>What's going on with Sony's live-service push?</strong></h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a></p><p>In July 2024, Sony's Destiny developer Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">announced mass layoffs and major structural changes</a>. A month later, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed.</p><p>At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market. He joked, "That's one of the reasons they removed me."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's live-service games</a>, check out the gallery below to get the latest on the status of all the projects in the works.</p>
