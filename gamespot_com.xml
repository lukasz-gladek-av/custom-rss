Up to this point, developer Compulsion Games hasn't said much about what the actual gameplay of South of Midnight is, so I was eager to check the game out when the studio offered a chance to see it in action. The demo was on the shorter side and, unfortunately, was hands-off, so I still don't know how it feels to actually play South of Midnight. But from what I saw, the game most reminded me of my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>--South of Midnight looks like an action-adventure game from the PS2 era: a far cry from Compulsion Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contrast-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-136280">Contrast</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/we-happy-few/" data-ref-id="5000-439978">We Happy Few</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In South of Midnight, you play as Hazel, a woman whose home of Prospero is hit by a hurricane. Learning she's a Weaver, a magician-like person who can unravel the corruption affecting a place and suture the fraying ties of the community, Hazel sets off in search of her mother who was washed away during the storm. Hazel can use her magical weaving abilities to tear apart enemies, acrobatically flip through platforms, and solve puzzles. Each major arc of the story sees Hazel uncovering the legend surrounding a creature--sometimes an animal, other times a person--that has achieved larger-than-life, otherworldly status as their past traumas twist them into mythical monsters. Upon deducing how these creatures became what they are, Hazel is tasked with defeating them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> South of Midnight Gameplay Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The setup looks a whole lot like Bridge of Spirits, with Hazel's efforts to explore the trauma and backstories of the creatures that threaten her home resulting in the area being cleansed, much as Kena fought off the Rot and the lingering spirits of the traumatized individuals left behind. And like Bridge of Spirits, South of Midnight takes nods from a culture not often explored in video games--just in this case, it's the American South instead of Bridge of Spirit's Bali (a small province in Indonesia).</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, South of Midnight looks like a modern-day take on the same type of gameplay Bridge of Spirits built on: that of the action-adventure game from the mid-2000s. The demo I watched saw Hazel use combos to take down mobs of enemies, platform between landmarks, complete optional challenges to unlock collectibles, and take on a larger-than-life monster in a boss fight. Again, I have no idea how the game actually plays, but in practice it looks familiar; it looks like a type of game I've played and enjoyed before. What I'm most curious to see is how the gothic-fantasy themes and Deep South setting inform the world design because that--for me, anyway--is what's going to set this game apart from its contemporaries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830"></a><figcaption>Hazel is a Weaver, using magic that emulates the act of weaving thread.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Where the South really influenced the gameplay was mostly across three things," game director Jasmin Roy told GameSpot. "It was the world itself, how we were going to go through various regions that have different biomes, which means in level design, and different spaces to navigate--all these buildings that are abandoned, things like that. And we went like, 'It would be cool to be able to jump on [buildings] and move around and do things. And that combined itself with magical realism--how you're going to have powers to interact with the fantasy element of the settings. And when you combine those two things together, you start going, 'Okay, I'd like to be able to jump, move, use the strands, manipulate objects, create objects with that fantasy of everything being this traditional arts and craft of weaving.' And then the third thing I know that really influenced [the world] was the mythical creature, folkloric, the giant thing. So that informed how we built the world and how we created mechanics to go around them."</p><p dir="ltr">Roy described South of Midnight as a more linear experience, with the player moving forward from one area to another. "The region informed all the rest [of the game]," Roy said. "And that's how we ended up creating a feature set and the gameplay loop and how it works. That's why we think it's a unique journey and it's all built as a journey. So you are asking, 'Oh, is it the same gameplay loop?' It does fluctuate because it is narrative-driven. So most of the time with the creature, it will play out with, 'Oh, I need to learn their story to go on.' But there are also other different beats of narrative events that will happen because dealing with creatures and regions is not the only thing you'll do in the game to progress. There are other events to be discovered once you get the game right."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831"></a><figcaption>Two-Toed Tom is a crocodile whose past has transformed him into a monstrously large creature.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Some of the [gameplay] loops do repeat, so I just want to make that clear," studio head Guillaume Provost said. "The experience [of meeting] the creatures pass through multiple beats and [culminate with] filling your bottle--those are loops that do repeat themselves that you do recognize throughout the game's structure itself. But to Jasmin's point, you don't always fight the creatures--there's no fighting. There are different types of encounters that you'll get throughout the game that kind of celebrate different beats that have to do with the story and/or contact your problem that the creatures are going through."</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of [the creatures] are going to focus on traversal," Roy said. "Some of them even focus on narrative beats. It really is a mixed bag. Some of them will evolve into direct confrontations, like we saw with the demo today. But there are other features that do focus on traversal. We have some of that, and we also have some that focus on that. I don't want to reveal them too much because I really think they're really cool. But yes, the idea was that even though the loop was going to be about experiencing their story and interacting with them and beating them, depending on which type of creature you're going to encounter, fighting wasn't always the right word. [Fighting them isn't] always the right thing because [the creatures] do have wildly different stories of things that happen to them."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829"></a><figcaption>Some of the mythical creatures Hazel encounters were once human.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"You as a player are there to resolve their trauma or help move past the situation that they're in," Provost continued. "So in certain cases, when it made sense from a narrative [standpoint], structural point of view, there is a combat sequence. For example, when Two Twod Tom eats your house, you get really angry. There's a setup for it that creates the conflict. Hazel, the main character, is not roaming around trying to kill mythical creatures. That's the key takeaway. When there is conflict, there's conflict that's instituted for a narrative construct and reason that makes sense. But in other cases, there are problems with the creature that don't involve conflict. It's better resolved either through narrative [choice] or puzzle-solving or platforming or other types of challenges that actually have to do with specifically the issues of that creature."</p><p dir="ltr">How the studio spoke about trauma was the one qualm I had about the game at the event, given how often "resolve" and "fix" were tossed around. The preview event didn't include an example of how Hazel would do this and the developers were vague on the subject, but I'm always wary of folks talking about trauma as an easily fixable issue when it's regularly an ongoing process. And taking into account that South of Midnight is taking inspiration from the Deep South, a place of long-lasting intergenerational trauma that rarely is just addressed and "fixed," I'm looking at this specific part of the game with an air of caution. Admittedly, the rest of the event showcased that Compulsion has shown a tremendous amount of respect and care toward other aspects of the American South in terms of ambiance, landmarks, music, and language--South of Midnight sounds like a trip to the Deep South--so it's just as possible that the studio has handled the themes of trauma with similar care and simply isn't ready to showcase how those storylines play out yet.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1717879913" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Midnight's mythical creatures and stories of trauma. "They're folktales; they're more universal. In this world, they're legends that [Hazel] ends up coming across after she starts her journey. And then the more she sees, the more it stops becoming surprising for her, and that's the magic-realism angle. Whereas after she leaves the most grounded area, which is where she's from, this little town, her home, and she starts going into what we call the focal arc of the Deep South, and she starts meeting these characters and communities, those people just accept these creatures around them. And those creatures, their story is really tied to the land, to the history of that land. And they would have more, I guess you'd say, high-level allegorical messages behind them, if that makes sense."</p><p dir="ltr">Having now seen a smidge of what South of Midnight has to offer, I'm mostly excited--I loved Kena: Bridge of Spirits so another game akin to that is right up my alley--but I do have some worries about the story that I hope to see addressed. South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>

<section><p>Creature-collector games have never looked like this before, but I hope it's a blueprint for the future.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The creature-collector genre is a space first and foremost dominated by Pokemon, then filled out with many games inspired by it. Lots of kids who grew up on the massively popular IP via the card game, anime, and its many video games are today developers looking to add their own spin on the format--some of them to modest or better acclaim, like TemTem, Cassette Beasts, and Palworld. I enjoy such games, but most of them tend to be uninterested in achieving a vision of a game I've had in my head for years--to no fault of their own, of course. It's <em>my</em> vision, not necessarily theirs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beastieball/" data-ref-id="5000-590692">Beastieball</a>, a new creature collector from Wishes Unlimited--the team behind heartfelt indie darlings Chicory: A Colorful Tale and Wandersong--seems serendipitously built from the ground up as though its studio read my mind. Finally, there's a Pokemon-style game that consciously washes its hands of some of the genre's more uncomfortable implications of animals.</p><p dir="ltr">I've written about the intersection of animal rights and gaming before, and many readers who previously overloaded my articles with negative comments were, from one perspective, right on the money. Where one may be concerned with animal rights, they need not extend their concern to virtual animals, since these are not living beings. To that, I both previously offered and once more render a resounding <em>duh.</em> But it's never been my point to argue for the liberation of Pokemon, Pals, or, in this case, Beasties.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather, my focus remains on <em>portrayals </em>of animals in games. How we present ideas through our media often affects how we view similar subjects in the real world, even if we can't always sense the changes taking shape. If I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of books, or listen to a lot of podcasts, all espousing a particular point of view, how long will it be until I start to believe it's true in real life? One needs only to look at how YouTube algorithms or the "manosphere" have, in many cases, Roganized a generation of (usually) white guys. My concern with how we gamify animal exploitation is not centered on freeing virtual animals from their imaginary shackles; it's about hoping to promote portrayals that reject the tropes we so often see in games--where animals are little more than crafting resources, transportation vessels, and supply chains. If we reconsider how animals are portrayed in games, it would have a knock-on effect in real life for some number of players. That's how progress happens, and Beastieball is a sure sign of it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782" data-ratio="0.56063618290258" data-width="1006" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782"></a><figcaption>The simple change from dogfighting to volleyball erases a lot of the genre's typical, more awkward implications.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So as to not bury the lede here, I'd enjoy Beastieball for much of what it does, even if it did those things the way Pokemon or any other major creature collector game does them. But by making a concerted effort to harmonize its story universe and its gameplay mechanics, it's revealed an exciting new, animal-friendly path ahead for games like it. None of this means you should feel bad for liking Pokemon. At the same time, it feels really good to like Beastieball.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon's central mechanic is its turn-based combat system, which has been around for so long that it can be easy to overlook that it's essentially in-universe dogfighting, a practice few would endorse in real life. There's long been debate about whether or not the creatures actually like fighting each other the way they're made to when captured by human trainers. Some say they enjoy it, and only resist capture so that the trainers can prove their worth. This doesn't seem to be in the text, but even if we accept it as true for the sake of discussion, the fact that a mistreated creature can't choose to leave their trainer suggests these creatures are closer to indentured servants than companions.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon does gift some of its prominent creatures with personalities--Ash’s Pikachu most of all, of course. But for the most part, the series' lovable monsters are defined only by their breed. The story is naturally focused on Ash and his entourage of Pokemon trainers. It's a story of human triumph in which the creatures are tools to achieve a goal. Beastieball goes to great lengths to ditch all of these notions and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780" data-ratio="0.56107249255214" data-width="1007" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780"></a><figcaption>Beasties form bonds and unlock additional moves during their volleyball matches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For one, its turn-based combat system is recontextualized as volleyball. It's said that the Beasties adore the sport, and they'll actively seek out trainers with whom they can tag along to meet other Beasties and play volleyball--called beastieball in-universe. There's no hint of Beasties causing harm to one another. Such a simple reimagining of the genre's key mechanic can help players of all ages, but especially younger, often more impressionable players, experience a creature collector that doesn't require the cognitive dissonance of believing you both love your creatures and eagerly send them into street fights.</p><p dir="ltr">Given how Pikachu is both Ash's companion animal and fiercest soldier, this depiction breaks down quickly. Pokemon asks us to accept that this is just how its world behaves. Fair enough, I suppose--the series has never been too concerned with self-reflection--but even better is <em>not</em> asking that of players, which is what Beastieball does.</p><p dir="ltr">Beastieball goes beyond just that, though. The entire world of the game exists in harmony with this example; it's clear that slight alterations in the genre's tropes were consciously made to get away from them. Beasties who play together a lot can become close friends and teach each other moves, and this process is depicted with the pair gleefully meeting for an epic celebration that expresses love and appreciation. Rather than force a Beastie into a Poke Ball-like object, they can be recruited via you discovering their unique recruitment conditions, like winning a game in a certain way or performing specific moves. And the Beasties you recruit trail behind and beside you, freely joining in on your adventure, like dogs on a walk rather than pets locked in a crate.</p><p dir="ltr">As you fill out your Pokedex-like Beastiepedia, details are filled in that often have nothing to do with gameplay mechanics. These short biographies feel heartfelt, as though their writers mean to celebrate the animals for their traits and personalities the way a museum would. It's not all there to help you dominate your competition and beat the game. A lot of it is pure enrichment via lore that sees its starring critters as unique beings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781" data-ratio="0.5609514370664" data-width="1009" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781"></a><figcaption>Townsfolk view their Beasties as companions, not belongings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even people around the open world will remark on their Beasties in such a sweet way. A woman I met early in my travels went on about how she feels her bird-like Beastie is unique from others in their family, and explained how that is. Beasties aren't merely tools or even breeds. They're individuals, each of them spoken of not as "it," like a chair or a doorknob, but "he," "she," or "they," like beings with their own wants and needs.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite such similar story structure and gameplay mechanics to Pokemon, Wishes Unlimited's game disposes of the parts that require mental gymnastics. Though you still want to be the very best (like no one ever was), to catch them is not your real quest. Its story is actually about saving a Beastie habitat from closure, and the adventure you go on is all in service of returning to your town with the resources to save a space that means so much to the local people and Beasties. This is not a tale of conquest; it's a story about community.</p><p dir="ltr">This has long been a genre where we often, consciously or not, ignore the uncomfortable implications of a story's universe. But Beastieball proves you can have it both ways. In the broader sense--the one that will ultimately determine the game's staying power--it's an awesome creature collector that will surely scratch the Pokemon itch so many never quite satisfy. But by bringing the studio's now-trademark air of emotional sincerity and attentive kindness to a genre where it's often lacking, Beastieball is the creature collector I always wanted but wasn't sure I'd ever get.</p>

Epic's graphically impressive and fast-paced arena shooter spawned multiple sequels, with the last, fully released entry being 2007's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/unreal-tournament-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-24294">Unreal Tournament 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic did release a pre-alpha build for a new entry in the series, simply called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/unreal-tournament/" data-ref-id="5000-301276">Unreal Tournament</a>, back in 2014. However, the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-fortnites-success-new-unreal-tournament-stops/1100-6463665/" data-ref-id="1100-6463665">officially canceled in 2018</a> as Epic shifted all of its focus to its money-printing battle royale juggernaut, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The preservation of the two classic Unreal games, which were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-shutting-down-online-servers-for-rock-band-unreal-tournament-and-more/1100-6510037/" data-ref-id="1100-6510037">delisted from storefronts in 2023 when Epic shut down official servers for them</a> alongside other older titles like Rock Band, is thanks to the work of a dedicated fan community by the name of <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Old Unreal</a>. They've made the process of downloading and installing the games on modern PCs as simple as a few clicks of a mouse. While there are no longer official dedicated servers and playing online multiplayer in each game requires jumping through some additional hoops, there are still community servers keeping each shooter alive in 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/479060/unreal-tournament-epic-games-internet-archive-free" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Epic confirmed that it isn't getting in the way of letting people play the two classic Unreal titles available on Archive.org, and said people are "free to independently link to and play these versions."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Epic has taken a more forgiving stance when it comes to some of its older game properties. Epic gave away an estimated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-have-hurt-paragon-but-its-turned-in/1100-6457495/" data-ref-id="1100-6457495">$12 million of in-game assets it built for its defunct MOBA Paragon</a> in 2018 for anyone making projects in Unreal Engine to use, some of which have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-pseudo-sequels-to-epics-scrapped-moba-paragon-are-out-now-in-early-access/1100-6509929/" data-ref-id="1100-6509929">repurposed into multiple Paragon successors</a>.</p>

                <p>The latest Xbox update restores friend requests, improves search, and adds more personalization options for profile pictures and home screens.</p><p>Starting with this update, you can only be friends with someone if they accept your invitation and vice versa. You can still follow people, but that's a one-way connection that updates you on the content they choose to share with followers. All current connections will update accordingly, meaning you won't have to make any changes to keep your current friends and followers list.</p><p>However, if you do want to manage your friends and followers, you can hit the Xbox button on your controller and select the People tab. Once there, you can look at your friends list, accept/delete requests, and search for new friends. Along with these changes, privacy and relationship-notification settings have been revamped.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1690/16904437/4399775-xboxecosystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399775" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1690/16904437/4399775-xboxecosystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399775"></a><figcaption>Friend requests and search functions have been updated across Xbox consoles and apps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1690/16904437/4399775-xboxecosystem.jpg"></figure><p>The new search function grants higher accuracy--according to Microsoft--and can interpret typos, shortcuts, synonyms and even emoji. The changes to search have rolled out on console and on the Windows Xbox app.</p><p>On console, you now have more freedom to customize your profile. You can create gamerpics (i.e. your Xbox profile pic) from achievement art or your screenshots. Additionally, you can zoom in and crop images when setting your home background.</p><p>As for the Windows Xbox app, the home interface has been revamped, letting you get back into what you've been playing with the "jump back in experience" (even from compact mode). The Xbox Accessories app has also gotten a free update, letting you calibrate thumbsticks and triggers, map mouse inputs, and more on your Elite or Elite 2 Controller.</p><p>In other Xbox news, a new ad campaign emphasizes the brand's offerings on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">mobile and smart TVs</a>.

                <p>Remedy is working with Annapurna Pictures on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-and-annapurna-strike-a-deal-to-expand-control-and-alan-wake-franchises/1100-6526191/" data-ref-id="1100-6526191">movie and TV show versions of Alan Wake and Control</a>, but how are those projects progressing? According to Remedy boss Sam Lake, it's still very early days for both.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy?utm_source=twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN</a>, Lake said the team is "very excited," but noted that it's "very, very early days."</p><p>In Hollywood, adaptations of popular brands get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/" data-ref-id="2900-5059">announced frequently but not every project makes it to market</a>. Time will tell how the Alan Wake and Control adaptations fare, but Lake said bringing Remedy's games to film and TV has been something the team has been looking into "for a long time."</p><p>"Now, with Annapurna, we have a perfect partner and it feels like a genuine collaboration. Obviously, they bring in their prestige expertise and we bring in our universe and our games, and together we are exploring ideas. But yes, early days, but I am very excited," he said.</p><p>Alan Wake II was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-marvel-not-just-twin-peaks-inspired-alan-wake-2/1100-6515464/" data-ref-id="1100-6515464">inspired in part by David Lynch and the Twin Peaks series</a>, and this prompted a question about whether or not Remedy would try to work with Lynch on its game adaptations for TV and film.</p><p>"Wouldn't that be cool?" Lake said. "Yeah, no. I mean, as I said, early, early days, and where we are with everything is that we are just exploring the potential in our universe for different projects and ideas. We'll see where it goes."</p><p>Lake also confirmed that he's never met Lynch, but is hopeful he can one day sit down with him over a cup of coffee and discuss art.</p><p>Remedy also has a deal with Annapurna Pictures for Control 2, and that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resigns-from-the-company-report/1100-6526463/" data-ref-id="1100-6526463">unaffected by the mass resignations at Annapurna Interactive.</a></p>
