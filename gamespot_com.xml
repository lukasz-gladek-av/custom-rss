Currently, players have to decide between the $20 Guild Wars: Game of the Year Edition, the $30 Guild Wars Trilogy, or buying each individual campaign for $20. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-is-celebrating-20-years-with-a-new-and-deeply-discounted-complete-edition/1100-6530852/" data-ref-id="1100-6530852">Guild Wars celebrated its 20th anniversary</a> with a $40 "Masterpiece Collection" bundle that brought together all of the original Guild Wars content under one roof.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>

                <p>The future for single-player games has been a question mark since the rise of multiplayer and live-service titles across the video game industry. But according to a newly released survey from Ampere Analysis, single-player games remain the preference for 56% of gamers.</p><p>Ampere has shared the results of its survey, which had responses from 34,000 players across 22 different markets around the world. The new findings note that interest in single-player games has increased 4% over the last four years, and that there's only a small percentage of women (58%) who favor those titles over men (56%) who share their preferences.</p><p>One of the key findings from this survey suggests that fan interest in single-player games increases with age. Only 49% of younger players between 16-24 preferred single-player, while 64% of gamers age 55-64 favored it. Among gamers 25-34, single-player games were preferred by 56%.</p><p>The report notes that the US has the highest share of gamers who prefer single-player titles with 65%. However, Chinese gamers reportedly have the least interest in single-player games, with only 47% of players saying that they prefer those titles.</p><p>"This data reaffirms that single-player games are absolutely still viable--and sought-after--in the live-service-dominated landscape," said Ampere's senior research manager Louise Wooldridge. "The market favors multiplayer games for their ongoing engagement and monetization, but cracking a finely balanced formula for single-player games can leverage this broad audience appeal. Although most gamers prefer this content to multiplayer experiences, the friendship circle still plays a significant role in game discovery and uptake."</p><p>In recent years, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">canceled a Last of Us multiplayer title</a> to focus on single-player games like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/" data-ref-id="1100-6530174">forcefully pushed back</a> on the notion that single-player titles are dead. The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-remains-committed-to-cutting-edge-single-player-games/1100-6530381/" data-ref-id="1100-6530381">its commitment to single-player games</a> as well. Earlier this month, Sony noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-ref-id="5000-511540">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstation-5s-most-played-games-is-a-single-player-title-from-2020/1100-6536204/" data-ref-id="1100-6536204">one of the most-played titles on PlayStation 5</a> since its debut in 2020.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> proudly displays its influences, and the resemblance to games like Persona is clear across multiple aspects. One of them is the school side of things--it's in the name, after all. While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities. (They don't seem to have an official name, so I'll just call them moons.)</p><p>There's a total of ten exams--the main story continues afterward, but there's a clear cut-off point at the end of week 1. Without further ado, you can find all Demonschool quiz answers below, listed by each corresponding week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_7">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 7</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_6">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 6</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_5">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 5</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_4">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 4</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_3">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 3</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_2">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 2</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_1">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 1</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</h2><ul><li>What is my name? - Thomas Vincent</li><li>Do the island and school have the same name? - Yes, they do</li><li>So what in fact is the island's name? - Hemsk</li><li>How many members are needed to form a club? - Four</li><li>Who is the school's dean? - Asatiani</li><li>If you fail in school, where do you go? - Prison</li></ul><p>Your reward is six moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</h2><ul><li>What happens when two demon hunters attack simultaneously? - A combo</li><li>Does every demon hunter have their own special attack? - Yes</li><li>When a demon hunter makes a slight adjustment left or right, what is that called? - Sidestep</li><li>What elements are all demons weak to? - Almighty</li></ul><p>Your reward is four moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</h2><ul><li>Who runs the island? - Dean Asatiani</li><li>What's the name of the alley shopkeep? - Triops</li><li>Who saved the island from invaders 100 years ago?
