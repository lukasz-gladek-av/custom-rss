                <p>Developer Rebellion is perhaps best known for the Sniper Elite series, but the UK's studio latest release, Atomfall, is now the developer's "most successful launch" in its 32-year history. </p><p>Atomfall launched in full on March 27 and reached 1 million players over its first weekend, climbing further to more than 1.5 million so far. The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident </a>in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>"To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion," the developer's CEO and co-founder, Jason Kingsley, said in a statement. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</p><p>Rebellion also shared some other stats from launch, including:</p><ul><li>316,000 players killed the scientist at the start of the game</li><li>Players have used the cricket bat 3.7 million times to rack up kills.</li><li>More than 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</li></ul><p>Atomfall no doubt benefitted in terms of player numbers by launching into the Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass game catalogs. Rebellion did not, however, say how many copies of Atomfall have been sold across all platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.</p><p>In fact, there is no indiciation at all as to how Rebellion is measuring success for Atomfall. Also unknown is how much Atomfall cost to develop or market. As always, game development budgets remain mysterious. What we do know is Atomfall is not Rebellion's first Game Pass day-one release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance was a Game Pass launch as well.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p>

A new trailer highlights the newest Nightfarer's (Nightreign's version of classes) impressive mobility, showing the ability to send out a scatter of arrows while sliding or even firing shots after double-jumping off a wall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQ4uE_TPdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Iron Eye has some heavy-hitting abilities as well, such as a move that pulls out a massive bow and arrow that can pierce enemies and is followed up by a shockwave that knocks down surrounding foes. The Ironeye joins other Nightfarers like the magic-specializing Recluse, the grapple-shot-wielding Wylder, the nimble assassin-like Duchess, and the tank-oriented Guardian for a total of five playable classes revealed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring Nightreign so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players got to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-included-over-30-billion-lost-runes/1100-6530467/" data-ref-id="1100-6530467">Elden Ring Nightreign in February as part of a network test</a>, only for it to be plagued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">server issues that From Software later apologized for</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>, Tamoor Hussain said that the battle royale-inspired nature of Nightreign at first seems like From Software is chasing multiplayer trends but in reality aligns with many of the design principles the studio is known for, calling it "very much a From Software game." In an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/" data-ref-id="1100-6529380">interview with GameSpot</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki said creation of the spin-off didn't begin with a battle royale-structure in mind, but was something that took shape over the course of development as a way to move players through the game's map.</p><p dir="ltr">Elden Ring Nightreign will release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 on May 30.

                <p>From the original PlayStation through to the PS5 Pro, graphics have always played a key role in marketing that console. Former Sony president Shuhei Yoshida thinks that it might be time for Sony to start focusing on other aspects of video games so that Sony can become popular in a "broader" sense.</p><p>"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values ​​such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken] Kutaragi-san's time," Yoshida said to <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a> (via a translation by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genki</a>). "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that. Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best--in terms of graphics quality--to those who want it. But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="588321705" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

for photorealistic visuals in several of its biggest games. While games like last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> are an exception to the rule, Sony generally tends to favor a degree of realism with its exclusives. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-boss-believes-games-with-live-action-like-visuals-may-arrive-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6530498/" data-ref-id="1100-6530498">games with live-action-like visuals</a> aren't far away from being realized.</p><p>There are downsides to this, as games striving for realism can look dated after a few years and the cost to produce them has grown enormously. Former Sony executive Shawn Layden has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/">the AAA video game space is unsustainable due in part to rising development costs</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/">Sony is aiming to speed up its game-development process</a> with AI and machine-learning initiatives.</p><p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/">revealed the reason why the studio sold itself to Sony</a> back in 2001 was due to rising development costs. As Gavin explained, Naughty Dog spent about $100,000 to develop 1992's Rings of Power, $1.6 million on the first Crash Bandicoot game released in 1996, and $1.6 million on Jak and Daxter in 2001.</p>

                <p>For several years, former Donkey Kong and Pac-Man champion Billy Mitchell's biggest battles shifted from arcade expos to courtrooms over allegations that he cheated on some of his championship runs. Now, Mitchell has emerged victorious in an Australian court against Karl Jobst, a YouTube artist who allegedly defamed Mitchell.</p><p>Jobst has accused Mitchell of cheating numerous times, including his contention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-donkey-kong-record-holder-billy-mitchell-accused-of-cheating-yet-again/1100-6511134/" data-ref-id="1100-6511134">that Mitchell used an 8-way joystick for Donkey Kong</a> in his record-breaking runs. Via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/01/donkey-kong-champion-billy-mitchell-wins-defamation-case-australia-youtuber-karl-jobst-ntwnfb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>, that allegation paled in comparison to Jobst's since-retracted assertion that Mitchell drove another YouTube artist, Apollo Legend, to suicide following his legal settlement with the former champ.</p><p>Jobst's defense in court argued that Mitchell has a reputation for cheating and for suing people who made those accusations. The judge agreed with that characterization of Mitchell, but ruled that Jobst's videos had "severely damaged Mitchell's reputation and caused distress."</p><p>Following the judge's ruling, Jobst must now pay $350,000 plus interest to Mitchell. When Mitchell brought the case to the court, he asked for $400,000 in damages and $50,000 in aggravated damages.</p><p>Mitchell had previously sued Twin Galaxies to force the organization to restore his high scores. The two sides <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twin-galaxies-has-reinstated-billy-mitchells-donkey-kong-records-kind-of/1100-6520365/" data-ref-id="1100-6520365">settled out of court</a> in early 2024, and Mitchell's scores were re-added to the historical section of Twin Galaxies' site, but not the current listing of scores.</p><p><em>Image credit: David Greedy/Getty Images</em></p>

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that Pac-Man on mobile will shut down on May 30, but players can continue playing the game until the closure date.</p><p>The shutdown notice came from within the Pac-Man game itself as well as both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pac-man/id293778748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments&amp;hl=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a>. It stated that in-app purchases will no longer be available after April 1. This version of the game contains the original 8-bit classic arcade experience, as well as original mazes in Story Mode. There are also limited-time themed events that reward players with exclusive skins through Adventure Mode.</p><p>It's notable that this version of the game, simply titled Pac-Man with no subtitle or additional branding, is shutting down, as 2025 marks the series' 45th anniversary. However, Bandai Namco is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/namco-is-celebrating-pac-mans-45th-anniversary-with-live-events-museum-exhibits-and-more/1100-6529868/" data-ref-id="1100-6529868">celebrating the anniversary in other ways</a>. Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture is hosting a special Pac-Man display from April 30-June 4, along with a themed event on May 10. From May 18-September 28, the Great Park Gallery in Irvine, California is also going to host a Pac-Man retrospective exhibition.</p><p>Club America will also offer limited-run Pac-Man-branded soccer jerseys, and Bandai Namco is partnering up with retailers like Walmart to launch new Pac-Man toys, apparel, and accessories.</p><p>Finally, the edgy and dark platformer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-brings-its-pac-man-metroidvania-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-in-july/1100-6530419/" data-ref-id="1100-6530419">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, is launching on July 18 for PC, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
