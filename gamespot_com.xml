                <p>Billionaire video game industry veteran Gabe Newell, the founder of Valve, has shared his thoughts on the role that artificial intelligence could play in the future of technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM&amp;t=1s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Zalkar Saliev</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-ai-is-a-significant-technology-transition-on-a-par-with-the-emergence-of-computers-or-the-internet-and-will-be-a-cheat-code-for-people-who-want-to-take-advantage-of-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>) from his yacht, Newell said he thinks it's "incredibly obvious" that machine learning and AI systems are going to "profoundly impact pretty much every single business." He said we could be looking at a huge technology transition on par with the arrival of the computer and the internet.</p><p>"So if I had to point to a technology transition to get in front of, it's to figure out how to use AI to do anything better. If you wanna be an accountant, learn AI, if you want to be an attorney, learn AI, if you're gonna be a programmer, you know, make sure that you know how to use the tools that are comfortable with those programming concepts. That all seems super obvious," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPFctkKv6RM?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Newell went on to say that people who reacted quickly when the internet came online years ago reaped the benefits of embracing the new technology, and something similar could happen with AI.</p><p>"On the internet there were the companies and individuals who saw the opportunity and took advantage of those opportunities to create more value either as an individual or as a corporation and they zoomed ahead of everybody else," Newell said. "So essentially AI is going to be a cheat code for people who want to take advantage of it."</p><p>That Newell is a big believer in AI is not a surprise. After all, he is a <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">co-founder of Starfish</a>, a neural network company similar to Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Starfish uses AI systems to fuel its research.</p><p>AI has been a major player in the world of technology and video games for some time already, but its expansion seems to be accelerating in part through evolutions of the technology, including generative AI. Nvidia, which supplies some of the hardware used to propel AI advancements, is reaping the benefits of late, recently becoming the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most valuable company in the world with more than $4 trillion in market cap.</a></p><p>Exactly how advancements to AI might impact jobs in gaming, and all sectors, remains to be seen, but some have expressed fear about job losses. In fact, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">job losses due to AI are coming</a>, but overall hiring will increase due to the number of new jobs created.</p><p>In related news, the video game voice actor strike recently ended, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">one of the major sticking points being protections against AI. </a></p>

                <p>The talent behind Critical Role have previously hinted at their collective desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-may-expand-into-video-games/1100-6528190/" data-ref-id="1100-6528190">to create a video game</a>. Now, it's finally happening as Critical Role has partnered up with AdHoc, the developer behind the upcoming superhero action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-first-video-game-development-adhoc-studio-1236463963/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the new game will be set in Exandria, the world that was created for Critical Role's fantasy campaigns. Critical Role's Travis Willingham also indicated that characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells could appear, but the story "would have to be something brand new."</p><p>Willingham was instrumental in bringing AdHoc into co-development on the new game after he was cast in Dispatch. He noted that Critical Role wants to follow Dispatch's template and open up the narrative based on player choices.</p><p>"We're tossing around ideas, what are we thinking about in terms of scope and budget, and some of the things we must have," said Willingham. "You are going to want to see your favorite characters."</p><p>The actor went on to explain that Critical Role doesn't see its new endeavor as a AAA title, and the team wants to complete the game in a faster timeframe than the typical five-year cycle for larger projects.</p><p>Earlier this year, Critical Role's Darrington Press <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-designers-join-critical-role-publisher/1100-6532474/" data-ref-id="1100-6532474">hired two of the designers behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</a> to create new fantasy projects for the company. More recently, Critical Role lined up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-notes-include-critical-role-collab-new-difficulty-mode/1100-6532694/" data-ref-id="1100-6532694">a collaboration with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After cryptic teases across social media--as well as a special teaser site created just for this new project--Saber Interactive has finally lifted the curtain on its next hellish adventure. Hellraiser: Revival is a new first-person survival horror adventure set in Clive Barker's Hellraiser universe--with an old friend and his original actor in the starring role.</p><p dir="ltr">Hellraiser: Revival follows Aidan, whose girlfriend unwittingly unleashes Pinhead--who will be portrayed by Doug Bradley for the first time in 20 years--and his Cenobite horde to drag her to Hell. Aiden must rescue his girlfriend from the Cenobites by following her into Hell, which the players will do in a first-person survival horror setting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_4kAp6gsZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>Aidan will use the Genesis Configuration puzzle box, along with an arsenal of other weapons, to fight the horrific Cenobite entity. Weapons shown in the announcement trailer--which has a redband version on the <a href="http://www.hellraisergame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official website</a>--include a knife and a baseball bat with nails in it, while we also get to see at least one kill with the powerful puzzle box itself.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Teasers for this new Hellraiser project began last week, as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saber-interactive-is-teasing-something-with-spooky-vibes-for-later-this-month/1100-6533234/">teaser website</a> with the URL <a href="https://july-22-2025.com/" rel="nofollow ">https://july-22-2025.com</a> mysteriously appeared--which showed nothing but static mixed with a brief flash of the number 55. Saber Interactive's official social media channels began pointing to the site, along with other teasers and a montage of horror-focused content creators reacting to the announcement trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Hellraiser: Revival will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, but no official release window was confirmed in the announcement.</p>
