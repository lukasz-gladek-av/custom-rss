                <p>IO Interactive has partnered with Moon Publishing to create Hitman: The Board Game. In it, up to four players can try their luck at taking down contracts using a variety of items and weapons pulled directly from past Hitman games. Hits will take place across the globe, as the game's various boards allow for a number of familiar locations to make an appearance. However, traps, different entry and exit points, and other obstacles should keep infiltrations feeling fresh. It looks like it’ll be a ton of fun, if Moon’s upcoming Kickstarter is successful.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJkaRKSaFM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWJkaRKSaFM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moon Publishing is known for creating solid table top experiences, including one based on Ghost Ship Games’ Deep Rock Galactic. That game came with several mini-figs, dice, and more, and even got an expansion. Based on the trailer, Hitman: The Board Game will potentially be just as be involved.</p><p>Already Moon released a few weeks back showcased different characters and boards, and a successful Kickstarter could mean more of both; it would be cool to get additional packs of high-profile targets and/or expansions offering iconic environments from the games.</p><p>Agent 47 has been on the move as of late. Even going so far as to target a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">James Bond villain</a> in a recent Hitman: World of Assassination update. This Hitman: The Board Game, however, could mark a new first for the iconic assassin. Fans looking to make this a reality can head over to Moon Publishing's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moodpublishing/hitman-the-board-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a> and hit the “notify me on launch” button.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fast-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-671284">Fast Fusion</a> has the distinction of being one of the few Switch 2-exclusive games available now, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/fast-fusion/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people seem to like it quite a bit so far</a>. Not content to rest on its laurels after the game's release, developer Shin'en is releasing a free content update later this week for the game that includes three new racetracks.</p><p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/exclusive-fast-fusions-first-major-update-arrives-this-week-with-three-new-tracks" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>, Fast Fusion's update will launch on June 26 and will include three new tracks, significantly expanding the game's offerings. From screenshots, these tracks will explore both urban and more natural areas, and will feature various types of weather.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5Hf2HIroc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this content drop, the update will also bring some tweaks and changes to help improve the game's performance. Shin'en is adding a "Pure" graphics mode that turns off upscaling and renders the game at 1440p dynamic resolution while docked and 1080p while handheld, in an effort to reduce any graphical blurriness caused by DLSS. The studio is also fixing some bugs and making progression slightly easier. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><p>Fast Fusion is the third entry in the Fast series of hovercraft racing games, and it boasts 4K/60FPS gameplay (enabled by DLSS). In addition to being one of the few exclusive games to the new console, it's also very accessible, costing only $15. Check out the launch trailer above to see the game in action.</p><h3>Fast Fusion Update 1.3 Patch Notes</h3><ul><li>Added Carbium Cup with three new tracks.  <ul><li>Alpine Trust</li><li>Sunahara Plains</li><li>Zenshoh Habitat</li><li><em>These tracks are based on FAST RMX tracks but with all new graphics and changed track layouts to allow to be played perfectly with the new Hyperjump feature.</em></li></ul></li><li>New PURE rendering mode without any upscaling, rendering at 1440p docked, 1080p handheld (dynamic resolution).</li><li>New GPU particle system for snow.</li><li>Two new jukebox entries.</li><li>Easier progression (lower price for 3rd cup).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode.</li><li>Stability and performance improvements.</li></ul>

Destroyed robots drop cash that can be used to purchase class upgrades. According to the <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_game_modes#Mann_vs._Machine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2 wiki</a>, there are currently 29 missions and five operations (groups of missions played in sequence) for Mann vs. Machine.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, 13-years-later, Valve is looking to update Mann vs. Machine with the community's help. Valve, in the signature comedic style it always uses when writing about Team Fortress 2, is asking players to submit Mann vs. Machine maps and missions by August 27 for possible inclusion in the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve's tongue-in-cheek <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=247188" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> clarifies that the update, or at least a portion of it, will be arriving right before Halloween, but that the submitted maps do not need to all be Halloween-themed (though some of them could be, Valve later states).</p><p dir="ltr">"The king of the fictional land where this all happened (ancient Greece), decreed on stone tablets that even though the update was dropping right around the ancient Greek candy-harvest festival of Halloween, the maps did not need to all be Halloween-themed (first tablet) and in fact shouldn't be (second tablet)," Valve writes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Valve has asked for help to create new Team Fortress 2 content. The class-based FPS received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">14 new community-made maps</a> as part of a major summer update in 2023.

The mod returns the game to how it was in 2008, albeit with new weapons, modes, and quality-of-life features.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being nearly 20-years-old, Team Fortress 2 still has a strong following on Steam and is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">best free games on Steam</a>. Over the past six months, the game has maintained anywhere from around 40,000 to 56,000 concurrent players, and actually reached a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-which-was-released-16-years-ago-just-broke-a-player-record/1100-6515946/" data-ref-id="1100-6515946">concurrent player peak of over 250,000</a> in 2023 following the release of the previously mentioned summer update.</p>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is currently putting Agent 47 on the backburner while focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">the upcoming James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a>.

"The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</p><p>Abrak went on to note that First Light will feature greater stealth, action, and seamless combat options that let players switch between ranged attacks and melee on the fly. He added that Bond will follow his character's long-standing tradition of driving exotic cars.</p><p>"That gives us more challenges to play with," added Abrak. "In Hitman, you have these live challenges.
