                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">unveiled as soon as this week</a>, according to some reports. But once the system arrives, the real question is what's going to be on it beyond AAA Nintendo titles? According to a new report, Nintendo may have already secured some AAA support from Konami, Square Enix, and Ubisoft.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate the Hate</a> is reporting that Konami's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will be among the titles available on Switch 2, as will Square Enix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. But it sounds like Ubisoft will be going even deeper by bringing a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> for the Switch 2 launch window. The upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, is also said to be in the works for Switch 2, but not in time for the system's launch. That title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">recently pushed back to March</a>.</p><p>The report goes to mention that Ubisoft is "doing more than half a dozen games for the Switch 2," including a game from The Division series, Rainbow Six Siege, and a potential compilation of the two Mario + Rabbids games. Earlier this month, a separate report from Nate the Hate suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Microsoft will bring Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to both Switch 2 and PS5 in 2025.</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">Switch 2 could sell 4.3 million consoles</a> this year alone in the US, according to at least one video game analyst. Despite Nintendo's veil of secrecy, potentially leaked details about the Switch 2 have been running rampant. At CES, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">a Switch 2 mockup</a> that may have earned the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">a visit by Nintendo's lawyers</a>. Once Nintendo officially announces Switch 2, the level of interest it attracts may only get bigger as it gets closer to launch.</p>

The 256GB version is currently available for $349 (was $400), and it includes a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow so you can start gaming on the VR headset right away. As an added bonus, you’ll get a free 3-month trial of Meta Quest+, which gives you access to a deep catalog of other VR games along with a rotating monthly selection.</p><div title="6528767 - Meta Quest 3S Discount" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3057" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528767 - Meta Quest 3S Discount" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Meta Quest 3S (256GB)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$349 (was $400)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Quest 3S is the more affordable sibling of the Quest 3, though it offers many of the same specs. This includes the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset, 8GB RAM, and support for the Touch Pro controllers. The main difference is in the lenses, as the Quest 3S uses 1832 x 1920 Fresnel lenses (found in the Quest 2) while the Quest 3 uses 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses. However, the lower resolution should result in longer battery life.

                <p>The first major professional tennis tournament of the year, the Australian Open, is underway now in Melbourne. New for the 2025 event is an alternate broadcast that makes players look like something out of Wii Sports. The Australian Open organizers rolled out what they are calling "AO Animated" versions of tennis matches this year, featuring animated, video game-looking versions of the real players.</p><p>As you can see in the video game, from the Jacob Fearnley vs. Nick Kyrgios match, the animation is far from perfect--at times, the player's racket and the tennis ball vanish out of thin air. The audio doesn't sync up perfectly, either. But it's pretty solid, all things considered. You can watch more of these matches on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open YouTube page under the "Live" tab.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fla1j5t4-Ws" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fla1j5t4-Ws" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Broadcasts of this nature are becoming more and more popular these days. Before this, the NFL and Disney+ partnered to air a very <a href="https://www.nfl.com/schedules/simpsons-funday-football" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre-looking Simpsons-themed broadcast</a> of the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Dallas Cowboys game on December 9. This broadcast had the likes of Homer, Bart, Moe, Carl, Barney, and Lenny suiting up and making plays on the field.</p><p>Before that, the NHL and Disney teamed up for a video game-style broadcast of a professional hockey game, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-nhl-broadcast-will-look-like-a-video-game-tonight-and-a-chicken-will-drop-the-puck/1100-6512314/" data-ref-id="1100-6512314">characters from the show Big City Greens lacing up their skates.</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-playoff-game-is-on-nickelodeon-this-sunday-with-spongebob-graphics-and-slime/1100-6499505/" data-ref-id="1100-6499505">who could forget the NFL's slime game featuring SpongeBob</a>?</p>

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly announcing a new entry in a "legendary Japanese IP" during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Along with this new game, Microsoft will also show off Doom: The Dark Ages, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and South of Midnight.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, this IP has decades of history and "should make a lot of fans happy."

Ninja Gaiden is one of the first franchises to come to mind. While it's not exclusive to Xbox platforms, entries like Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden 2 were.</p><p>However, The Game Kitchen and Koei Tecmo recently revealed the 2D side-scrolling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ninja-gaiden-game-on-the-way-from-blasphemous-devs/1100-6528432/" data-ref-id="1100-6528432">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, so a new fully-fledged 3D entry may not be likely.</p><p>Another possibility could be Resident Evil 9, as Capcom already confirmed that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-confirms-new-resident-evil-game-is-in-development-with-resident-evil-7-director/1100-6524638/" data-ref-id="1100-6524638">new entry is in the works with Resident Evil 7's director.</a> A new Tales games could be announced, as the franchise enters its 30th anniversary this year.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-6s-main-color-might-have-leaked/1100-6522502/" data-ref-id="1100-6522502">Persona 6 announcement</a> could be possible too, as Atlus has been relative quietly about its 2025 plans after having an impressive 2024 release slate with Persona 3 Reload, Unicorn Overlord, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/" data-ref-id="1100-6528323">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><p>In other Japanese Xbox news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> is reportedly set to release on Xbox sometime this year.</p>

                <p>Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 launches later this week and developer Grinding Gear has now previewed what to expect from it.. According to game director Jonathan Rogers, this patch primarily addresses issues developer Grinding Gear can address "relatively quickly," such as endgame maps and enemy balance.</p><p>You can see some of the details in a new video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile YouTube</a> channel. Endgame mapping (i.e. the autogeneration of levels) have received a balance overhaul, altering the number of chests, number of monsters, and lots of other variables. Four new "Tower" maps have been added, and the first Tower map, Lost Towers, has been redesigned to be "less boring." More endgame maps will include bosses, correcting a glitch that causes fewer bosses to spawn than intended.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNJSDxwC9bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pinnacle content has gotten some tweaks too. You'll be able to see citadels from further away in the fog of war making them easier to find. You'll also get up to six respawns for the pinnacle boss The Arbiter of Ash. The respawns can only be activated by the player who put in the keys at the Burning Monolith and they affect every player in your party at once. Respawns will be added to other Pinnacle content soon.</p><p>In other changes, lower-level unique items have gotten buffs to make them more fun to use. The patch makes effects more visible, both by removing clutter from some maps and by redesigning existing effects. Many monsters and bosses have gotten significant balance changes, such as some attacks not being triggerable when the enemy is off-screen.</p><p>Rogers noted that if a specific issue isn't discussed in this patch that does not mean that Grinding Gear is not aware of it or that it will not get addressed. You can look for the full patch notes when the patch launches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 will eventually be free-to-play,</a> but if you want to get early access, you'll have to shell out some cash.

                <p>We've known since the beginning of Chapter 6 Season 1 that we'd be getting a Godzilla skin with the battle pass in January. But it looks like this collaboration is going to be a lot bigger than you might have expected. Like, a <em>lot</em> bigger--judging by the short teaser Epic Games just dropped, there will be a skyscraper-sized Godzilla roaming the battle royale island starting this week.</p><p>It's not the most shocking news, since a Godzilla-sized Godzilla is a fairly logical thing to expect from a game that's had <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuY_X5ALrak?si=a7C69amDs0FzmKA3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">kaiju-sized monsters and mechs on the island in the past</a>, but it's cool to see the confirmation even so.</p><p>It's pretty clear, however, that there's still plenty more to this collab than we know about right now. For one thing, this collab is with Legendary Pictures for its Monsterverse franchise and last year's Godzilla x Kong--it would be pretty reasonable to expect both a King Kong skin in the item shop and a large King Kong boss on the battle royale island to battle Godzilla. And there are plenty of other potential kaiju from that franchise that could get skins, like Mechagodzilla and the Scar King.</p><p>The Godzilla skin is included with the Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass starting Jan. 17, though it will require a little bit of grinding to unlock. But, unlike in past seasons, you won't need to do any specific quests. Instead, Godzilla will be unlocked by earning XP in any experience--no need to play battle royale at all if you don't want to.</p><p>The timing of Godzilla's arrival is amusing, since this week is also bringing us the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku-themed Fortnite Festival Season 7</a>. Miku famously fought Godzilla in <a href="https://youtu.be/wPayU7s-G5Q?si=XZk4D637ia5xbAgH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a video from one of the Project DIVA rhythm games</a>, and so this is a bit of a serendipitous pairing.</p>
