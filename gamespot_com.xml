                <p>Amazon and Games Workshop have <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that they've reached a final agreement regarding the creative guidelines for adapting the Warhammer 40K universe into several different films and television series.</p><p>Man of Steel star Henry Cavill, who's in charge of producing and starring in the show, posted on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDY_euNohPB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> that he had been recently busy workshopping the different characters and lore to adapt. "Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop," he explained. "That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret."</p><p>Warhammer 40K developer Games Workshop also said in a community update post that the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first project is about to go into full development</a>, starting with its scripts, which will form the foundation for future projects in the universe. The production process for these films and series is expected to take a number of years to develop to fruition.</p><p>The deal between Amazon Prime's Warhammer 40K show and Henry Cavill began in 2022 when Cavill announced his attachment to the project. A year later, Amazon, Games Workshop, and Cavill <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">finally solidified a deal</a>.

                <p>After an 11-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">Path of Exile 2</a> got off to a hot start earlier this month with its early-access period. Although fans have responded very favorably to the game so far, Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games has already taken in player feedback for some post-launch changes.</p><p>In a post on Path of Exile 2's <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the developer noted that some of the most pressing issues have already been addressed with a new update, while others will be fixed in an upcoming patch. One area that Grinding Gear is moving more cautiously on is item-drop frequency. To give players more rewards, the number of rare monsters is being increased, while more valuable drops can be earned from defeating the extra-difficult rare monsters that appear later in the game.</p><p>Some of the adjustments being saved for a later patch include dodge-roll modifications that will make it easier to avoid being trapped by monsters, the ability to teleport between saved checkpoints, the addition of more checkpoints, and a change to the minimap that will make rare monsters appear when there are 200 remaining, instead of 50 remaining.</p><p>Grinding Gear previously announced that Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-on-ps5-and-xbox-will-have-couch-co-op-with-cross-progression/1100-6523835/" data-ref-id="1100-6523835">features cross-play and cross-progression</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The publisher also assured players that the sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">isn't replacing the original Path of Exile</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">Path of Exile 2 rushed passed the 1 million players</a> mark in early access.</p><p>The notes for Path of Exile 2's 0.1.0c patch are reproduced below.</p><ul><li>Campaign bosses killed after the first kill will now drop less currency items, replacing them with other items.</li><li>Increased the drop rate of Regal Orbs.</li><li>Significantly increased the drop rate of Gemcutter's Prisms.</li><li>A single Gemcutter's Prism also improves the Quality of a Skill Gem by +5% (previously +1%).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Chaos Orbs and distributed it amongst the other more valued Currency Items (Like Regal Orbs, Exalted Orbs).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Artificer's Orbs and distributed it to Lesser Jeweller's Orbs.</li><li>Disenchanting Rare Items with 6 Modifiers now provides 2 Regal Shards (previously 1). The value displayed will still show as 1 until a later patch.</li><li>Increased the values of all Prefix Modifiers that can roll on Waystones. We've also adjusted the chances of getting the more commonly powerful Modifiers such as increases to Rarity and Pack Size.</li><li>Monster Modifiers now grant higher amounts of Item Rarity and Item Quantity. This is most common on Magic and Rare enemies, but also affects Unique Enemies if applied through various Endgame Mechanics like the Deadly Evolution Keystone.</li><li>Increased the chance for Rare Monsters in Maps to have 3 or 4 modifiers.</li><li>Rare Monsters in Map areas are now revealed on the minimap when there are 200 Monsters remaining (previously 50).</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Persistent Buff Skills, such as Raging Spirits and Mana Remnants, were not working for the Infernalist when in Demon Form.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could sometimes be unable to interact with the Map Device in The Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Monsters Shattered in a Blood Circle Ultimatum Encounter were not contributing blood.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the instance to permanently stop time (freeze) when trying to revive a Chronomancer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Rare Monsters could not be found within the Chimeral Wetlands.</li><li>Fixed a bug where "Move only" was name-locking.</li><li>Fixed three instance crashes.</li><li>Fixed a client crash.</li></ul>

                <p>New information continues to come to light about the suspect in the brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including a connection to the world of video games. The suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, worked at Civilization studio Firaxis Games, a spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/493418/uhc-shooter-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-arrest-firaxis-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>What appears to be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/details/experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mangione's LinkedIn page</a> states that he worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis from May 2016-August 2017; he said he fixed more than 300 UI bugs in the game. Also in 2016, Mangione's alleged LinkedIn page says he was the founder and president of <a href="https://pennupgrade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Upgrade,"</a> a game development and research team at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Following his Firaxis internship, Mangione's subsequent career roles were seemingly outside of the game development scene.</p><p>Mangione was arrested on Monday, December 9, after he was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was later charged with the murder of Thompson in Manhattan on the morning of December 4. Mangione is currently detained in Pennsylvania; he is expected to be extradited to New York to face charges.</p><p>According to a law enforcement source talking to <a href="https://apnews.com/live/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-updates-day-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>, Mangione was in possession of a three-page, handwritten letter that said in part, "I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone." The note reportedly added, "I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites had it coming."</p><p>Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said in a court appearance that Mangione had $10,000 in cash when he was detained, including $2,000 in foreign currency. Police said they found a black, 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printed black suppressor in Mangione's backpack. Police documents said Mangione "became quiet and started to shake" after being asked if he had been in New York recently.</p>

                <p>Recently, voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that Geralt would be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, but he's now walking back those comments after he was "slapped" by developer CD Projekt Red for saying anything in the first place. At the MCM Comic Con Birmingham event recently, Cockle said his original comments were based on "a rumor," and he claims he doesn't know if Geralt will actually be in The Witcher 4.</p><p>"I did go online and I said something about this, and then I got slapped by CD Projekt because… I don't know how true it is," he said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-may-not-have-geralt-after-all-his-actor-was-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-accidentally-sharing-a-rumor-that-hed-be-in-it-just-not-as-the-protagonist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>. "I went off a rumor--I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character, and I don't actually know if that's true now, because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything!'"</p><p>Cockle went on to say he doesn't actually know what the story for The Witcher 4 is all about or if Geralt will feature in it. "Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me," he said.</p><p>Back in August, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">very matter-of-factly said</a>, "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time." In the same interview, Cockle admitted he might be lying through his teeth about everything he said.</p><p>As for what the actual developers have said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">The Witcher 4 won't just be "Witcher 3 in new clothing,"</a> according to CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski. More specifically, Nowakowski said to expect "new gameplay elements and new mechanics" that weren't a part of the original trilogy starring Geralt.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">The Witcher 4 has over 400 people working on the game</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">now in full production</a>.
