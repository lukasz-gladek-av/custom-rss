                <p>In November, the Xbox Series X|S console will have been around for five years. Naturally, there has been talk about the next generation of Xbox consoles, and Microsoft recently spoke about what it envisions for its future hardware and its idea of a player-first environment that will follow players across multiple devices.</p><p>Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald explained how the company is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem across multiple devices in the future. "When we think about the future of the Xbox, we're really focused on how do we put the player at the center of the experience, and when you really look at how modern players play games today, the vast majority play across multiple different devices," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the VP, Microsoft envisions players having options like the Xbox ROG Ally for when they're on the move, and dedicated hardware when they come home that'll allow them to pick up from right where they left off.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said. "So it's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center."</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">what we do know about the next-gen Xbox</a> is that it'll be powered by AMD technology, which Microsoft says will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" that's "enhanced" with the power of AI. The company also hinted at games not being "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, and in February, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the in-development console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><p>On the handheld side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">the Xbox ROG Ally will launch during the holiday season</a> and there'll be two models to choose from. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, while the base model ROG Xbox Ally is white and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Pricing for these units haven't been officially revealed yet, but recent leaks claim that the premium "X" model could cost as much as $1,050, while the ROG Xbox Ally is rumored to be $699.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has announced that its RTX Hair feature will be added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on September 4. In a nutshell, RTX Hair uses Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS) to improve lighting and shadows in video game hair, which Nvidia says is a solution that doesn't require a lot of extra memory as opposed to using triangles to render hair for every frame.</p><p>By using linear swept spheres, hair will look more realistic because the geometry is naturally round, thus making it easier to avoid self-intersection when casting shadow and reflection rays. This will allow Harrison Ford's digital doppelganger in the Indiana Jones game to sport a fuller head of hair when the update to the real-time path tracing mode arrives next month. The feature will be available to RTX-50 series GPUs, and earlier this year, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/" rel="nofollow ">Nvidia added</a> that this is a "big step toward rendering high-quality digital humans" in real time.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - 14 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive</p>
      </div>
<p>Hair and related elements like fur have been one of the more challenging things to accurately render in video games over the years. Fortunately, great strides have been made over the years as video game characters went from having what looked like static blobs of meat for hairdos--or buzz-cuts for many protagonists throughout the 2000s and early 2010s--to longer hair that moved realistically during gameplay.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched last year for PC and Xbox Series X|S--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">and in April 2025 for PS5</a>--and September will see the arrival of its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-dlc-the-order-of-giants-coming-in-september/1100-6532248/" data-ref-id="1100-6532248">The Order of Giants</a>. The DLC will see Dr. Jones embark on an expedition to uncover the secrets of the Nephilim Order.</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab has finally revealed the answer to a question we've all been asking about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a>, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">surprise hit co-op climbing </a>collab with Landfall--is Bing Bong sentient?</p><p>The answer is yes, or at least, he used to be. The studio revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kgWKv_iQ1Vg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent video</a> that developers used to possess Bing Bong to talk to streamers, but no longer will be doing so. In a video that shows a look behind the curtain, Aggro Crab revealed that devs would talk to players through Bing Bong, but only in cases where they were publicly sharing their game.</p><p>"It was a really funny way to give creators a wild experience in the first few weeks of us releasing Peak," the video explains. Aggro Crab also clarifies that devs weren't able to join private games, and that talking Bing Bong was only really present in those first few weeks. "We removed this feature mid-June, so if you are seeing anyone claiming that the devs are joining them through Bing Bong or any other way, they're full of sh**."</p><p>Bing Bong, a lumpy green plushie, is found on the crashed plane at the start of Peak. Even though he may no longer be sentient, he has become something of a mascot for the game, and many players give up precious pack space just to cart him to the top of the mountain.</p><p>This kind of direct interaction with streamers isn't out of character for Landfall--on the studio's previous title Clustertruck, the developers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7xRFTlahU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"hacked" a version of the game</a> being run at Summer Games Done Quick, interacting with the speedrunner through messages on the screen and modifying game visuals on the fly.</p><p>Peak has been surprisingly successful for a game developed largely in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/" data-ref-id="1100-6532754">one-month game jam</a>, selling over a million copies in its first week and continuing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/" data-ref-id="1100-6533021">reach higher player peaks</a> over time. The game is receiving regular updates, with the latest update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">adding the new Mesa biome</a>, and the one before that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">implementing cannibalism</a>.</p>

                <p>Despite the legendary dragon Pokemon's popularity, a large number of Pokemon fans are going around pronouncing Rayquaza's name wrong--and The Pokemon Company is trying to teach us how it's actually said.</p><p>If you use the common pronunciation of ray-KWAH-zuh, you would be incorrect according to official sources. A reminder of this--and the correct pronunciation--was popped up on the big screen at the Pokemon World Championships 2025 over the weekend, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-weve-been-saying-this-pokemons-name-wrong-all-these-years" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a>. According to the "mispronounced Pokemon" graphic shared by The Pokemon Company, the correct pronunciation is ray-KWAY-zuh, sounding closer to the word quasar.</p><p>While some fans reacted with shock to the official pronunciation, others flat-out refuse to adopt it. The iconic legendary has been around for a long time, making its first appearance in 2002's Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, before becoming the mascot Pokemon for Pokemon Emerald two years later. Having been a part of the series for over two decades, it's no wonder players would refuse to change how they've been pronouncing Rayquaza all this time.</p><p>Of course, some fans on social media point out that they already use the correct pronunciation, which is used more often than not in Rayquaza's infrequent but memorable appearances in the Pokemon anime.</p><p>The next big Pokemon release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and while the game has more of a focus on Mega Evolutions as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/" data-ref-id="1100-6533977">major combat shakeup</a>, it's not clear if fan-favorite Mega Rayquaza will be making an appearance.</p>

The update, titled Emotional Rescue, includes a new realm replicating Inside Out's Headquarters, and introduces Joy and Sadness as new characters--along with plenty of new items and cosmetics.</p><p>When the free Emotional Rescue update drops on August 20, players will be able to access a new realm from the Dream Castle--the Headquarters from Inside Out. Players can complete various quests themed after the Disney Pixar film, and build a remote Headquarters to invite Joy and Sadness to their Valley. Both characters have tasks they need help with in exchange for cute themed Friendship rewards--Joy wants to fix the Valley's mood swings, while Sadness needs help with a rainy day.</p><p>The Memory Mania Mini-Event will be returning between September 1 and 16, where players will have to track down Riley's phone when it spawns around the Valley in exchange for rewards themed after Inside Out 2. The nostalgia theme continues with a Retro Roadtrip Star Path featuring retro furniture pieces and vintage fashion, allowing players to create a kitsch drive-in movie theatre for the Valley.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifx8vineBcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ifx8vineBcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new update also has some new additions to the Premium Shop, including Lucky from 101 Dalmatians, and new Dream Styles for Anna from Frozen and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog.</p><p>Along with the new content, the free update also includes plenty of improvements and quality-of-life updates for Dreamlight Valley, including an overhaul of the Star Path system and Routine Duties, making the regular Duties easier to complete.</p><p>As the number of companions available in the game has grown, players will now be able to equip two companions with them at once. They'll also be able to assign certain animal companions to associated villages--for example, Pua or Heihei can be assigned to Moana or Maui.</p><p>You can check out the full list of changes, including gameplay improvements and bug fixes, in the <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/update-aug-20-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below.</p><h2>Emotional Rescue Update Patch Notes</h2><h2>NEW CONTENT</h2><ul><li>Head over to the Dream Castle, find a new door, and cross over into a memorable realm.</li><li>Meet Joy and Sadness in the Headquarters and put together a grand Dream Production to help inspire Riley for an upcoming talent show!</li><li>Place a remote Headquarters in your Valley to welcome Joy and then Sadness, along with their memorable Quests.</li><li>Assist Joy in solving the Valley’s mood swings and help Sadness fix a ‘rainy day’ to collect heartwarming Friendship rewards.</li><li>Buckle-up, we’re going on a road trip!

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-285282">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, and a new operator is coming to the game in September when Year 10: Season 3 begins with Operation High Stakes. The new guy is called Denari, and he's got the potential to be a game-changing defender thanks to his ability to lay down laser traps.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwW4zfpvE4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VuwW4zfpvE4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Denari is a Swiss military veteran who wields a Scorpion EVO 3 SMG or an FMG-9 SMG, and an optional P226 Mk 25 pistol in conjunction with his Glaive-12 shotgun sidearm. But the real attraction is his ability to use T.R.I.P. connectors to make laser grid traps that can slow down enemies or even temporarily trap them. The lasers do inflict damage, and simply powering through won't get rid of them because the devices reactive after a few seconds.</p><p>There are a few ways to counter Denari's T.R.I.P. connectors, including shooting them, melee attacks, or using explosives. Drones can also be used to dismantle the connections. However, the most effective tactic appears to an impact EMP grenade that can disable the laser field. Unfortunately, many of those options leave attackers wide open for a trap by Denari or his allies.  </p><p>Ubisoft also announced that Lair, Nighthaven Labs, and Consulate will be added to the pool of modernized maps. The Dual Front mode is also adding a safe room that will allow teams to regroup in the middle of a match to take the advantage. Some of the other balancing tweaks include the removal of magnified scopes from Doc, Rook, Frost, Echo, Castle, Tachanka, and Goyo. Sledge, Oryx, Pulse, Rook, and Ying will also be able to use the Reaper MK2 machine pistol, which was previously exclusively wielded by Rauora.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X: Operation High Stakes will begin on September 2.</p>
