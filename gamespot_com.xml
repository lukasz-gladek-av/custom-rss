                <p>Supermassive Games has announced another round of layoffs and has delayed its next Dark Pictures game. In a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement shared on social media</a>, Supermassive said it's cutting staff against the backdrop of a "challenging and ever-evolving environment" in the video game industry.</p><p>"As we adapt our team structure to better align with these changes, we've had to make the very difficult decision to begin a redundancy consultation process where we anticipate losing up to 36 of our colleagues," Supermassive said. "This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to those affected."</p><p>The restructure has "no impact" on the making of Little Nightmares III, Supermassive said, but the same cannot be said for Directive 8020, which is the latest entry in Supermassive's The Dark Pictures Anthology.</p><p>"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p>Supermassive Games is owned by Nordisk Games, which also owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios.</p><p>Supermassive Games previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-games-is-cutting-jobs/1100-6521363/" data-ref-id="1100-6521363">cut jobs in February 2024</a> with up to 150 positions impacted. Numerous video game companies have laid off staff in recent times, including Microsoft. The Xbox company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">recently laid off staff, canceled games, and closed at least one studio outright. </a></p><p>Directive 8020 is a survival-horror game starring Lashana Lynch, who is known for her roles in the James Bond movie No Time To Die and in the MCU for playing Maria Rambeau.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The wait won't be much longer to visit Sedge Town and Pokemon Forest, where you can see a group of Pikachu hanging out in the woods. That's because PokePark Kanto is slated to open in early 2026, with advance ticket sales starting later this year for the Tokyo-based attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">The new PokePark Kanto details were shared as part of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6784/#1">Pokemon Presents</a> livestream. According to The Pokemon Co., this will be "the first permanent outdoor Pokemon attraction" ever. It's built upon two main areas--the previously mentioned Sedge Town and Pokemon Forest--and sits on 26,000 meters of land at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomiuriland" rel="nofollow ">Yomiuriland</a>. The Pokemon Forest aims to show Pokemon in natural settings, while Sedge Town will see trainers and Pokemon sharing space together.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZAe5ewM-ic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="330">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zZAe5ewM-ic?start=330" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One interesting note about PokePark Kanto is that it's not set in a Universal theme park. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-in-orlando-opens-next-year-check-out-a-first-look/1100-6523129/">Super Nintendo World opened at Universal Orlando</a> earlier this year, with similar Mario parks at Universal Studios Hollywood and Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">PokePark Kanto was first announced in December 2023, according to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/a-new-pokemon-theme-park-is-launching-in-japan">Nintendo Life</a>. Kanto is the setting for the first games in the series, Pokemon Red and Blue. The theme park will open 30 years after the Game Boy titles launched in 1996 in Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, The Pokemon Co. also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-friends-is-a-brand-new-pokemon-game-out-today-for-switch-2-and-more/1100-6533330/">revealed Pokemon Friends for Switch systems and mobile devices</a> today.
