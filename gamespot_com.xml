                <p>The popular soccer game Rematch has reached 5 million players, and now the game's newest patch has arrived, ushering in new features and changes--however, the promised cross-play feature remains missing.</p><p>Developer Sloclap said in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that the new Rematch patch "contains many changes in all domains, which should all improve the game in different ways." As for the promised cross-play feature and netcode improvements, Sloclap said these efforts require "the work of specialists in their domain."</p><p>"We can't put all our resources on these topics to make them happen faster," Sloclap said. However, the studio teased that it's making "very good progress" and will have more news to share soon.</p><p>New for Rematch in the update is a colorblind mode that caters to people with deuteranopia, protanopia, or tritanopia by offering a toggle for team colors. Additionally, the player-progression screen has been updated to improve readability. In terms of fixes, the ball indicator should no longer incorrectly follow the ball, while issues with the social panel screen have been addressed.</p><p>There is also a new gamepad-remapping feature in Rematch that is described as "quite basic" for now, but Sloclap said it wanted to start slow here before offering a "more advanced version soon." The new Rematch update also has an improved goal validation system for when the ball is caught on the line. "Decision-making now uses a delay to check for potential deflect/catch and account for network variation before validating the goal," Sloclap said.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>Sloclap also announced that it's creating Test Servers for the purpose of testing future updates in "separate environments." Sloclap said it needs to spend more time on this before it's ready, however.</p><h2>Matches / Core Gameplay Improvements</h2><h2>Major Changes / Updates</h2><p>Gamepad Remapping</p><ul><li>This first version is quite basic (it doesn’t allow to create combinations of inputs), but we opted to allow players to start tinkering with mapping before offering a more advanced version soon.</li></ul><p>Better Hit Detection</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the ball would be deflected instead of being caught by the goalkeeper in certain situations : the ball speed was not correctly evaluated to decide whether to catch or deflect.</li></ul><p>Note: some design to tweaks to catch vs. deflect parameters will also be coming soon.</p><ul><li>Improved goal validation when the ball is caught on the goal line : decision making now uses a delay to check for potential deflect/catch and account for network variation before validating the goal.</li><li>Other general netcode improvements and fixes.</li></ul><h2>Major Fixes</h2><ul><li>Multiple fixes to camera during goal replays, removing jitter</li><li>Fixes to "hindering" (physical contact between players): it should now be more efficient to “body block” opponents</li><li>Fixed end match screens skip function (at last!): scoreboard can now be analyzed without going back to ranking screen automatically</li><li>Fixed pause menu toggle in any stage of match: pause menu should be accessible at all times during matches</li><li>Fixed various crashes happening during post-goal sequence</li></ul><p>Multiple animation improvements and fixes</p><ul><li>New statics tap animations</li><li>Polish on volley shoots animations</li><li>Polish on Dive player animations</li><li>Polish on pushball animations</li><li>Minor animation improvements and fixes</li></ul><h2>Minor / Misc.

                <p>After a lengthy stretch of rumors, reports and leaks, the next major installment in the Battlefield franchise is finally being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-trailer-coming-very-soon-see-a-teaser-now/1100-6533340/" data-ref-id="1100-6533340">unveiled on July 24</a>. Before then though, we've received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s first teaser, and things are looking pretty chaotic out there. </p><p>The scattered teaser primarily cuts between several news clips providing a lot of context for the game's inevitable conflict. Of significant note is the trailer's emphasis on the collapse of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is an alliance of existing world militaries. In the broadest sense, this alliance is meant to act as a form of deterrence, both to prevent members from fighting and to prevent outside states from attacking a member.</p><p>Battlefield 6 seems to kick off with an attack on NATO though, with much of the teaser focusing on news reports from all around the world about an attack on a NATO base in Mukhrovani, Georgia. Interspersed between these reports is other alarming news stemming from the fallout of this attack, including the assassination of a secretary general at NATO HQ, a frenzied social media response, and the US president's mobilization of armed forces.</p><p>Throughout, repeated mentions are made to Pax Armata, who appear to be the villainous faction of Battlefield 6 and the perpetrators of the attacks, which can be seen spreading to Belgium and then Gibraltar. The Battlefield X account also makes mention of the organization in the teaser announcement, which reads, "Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks. Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But who’s pulling the strings and to what end?"</p><p>The teaser stresses the modern setting of the latest Battlefield game, which was recently confirmed by leakers and eventually EA. The series has been all over the timeline recently, with Battlefield 2042 taking place in the near future while the game before it, Battlefield V, took place during World War 2.</p><p>It won't be long before we learn more about Battlefield 6's gameplay and setting, seeing as the reveal is set for July 24. Additionally, EA and Battlefield Studios have shared that there will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">open beta</a> ahead of the game's release where it is expected to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
