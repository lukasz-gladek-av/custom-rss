                <p>When two things rub together, they create friction, and friction slows things down and creates wear. That includes not just things like analog sticks, but the keyswitches in our keyboards, too. Cherry, the German company that sets the standard for keyswitch quality and consistency, is offering their own answer to those problems with <a href="https://www.cherry.de/en-gb/company/news/press/article/cherry-leads-the-revolution-from-mechanical-to-smart-switches" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some of their latest keyswitches</a>, announced this at this year's Computex computing convention, held yearly in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p>One of the most common (and annoying) ways we see frictional wear as gamers analog stick drift, which occurs when the potentiometers beneath your analog sticks begin to wear out or get debris caught in them. Cherry has two of their own switches that look to prevent this issue, the MK and IK switches. Cherry name is so synonymous with their MX switches that you might think the company's name is Cherry MX, but these two switches help prove otherwise.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498373,1300-4498374,1300-4498375,1300-4498376,1300-4498377" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498373-ik1a-11lb_image002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498374-mx2a-hcad_image002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498375-mx2a-j1nb_image005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498376-mx2a-lc9d_image012.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4498377-unnamed%2821%29.png"></figure><p>Cherry showed off a preview of the MK magnetic switches at the show. They don't have a release window for these just yet, but they're in the works. Magnetic switches promise to offer "frictionless speed and gaming grade precision," according to Cherry. With these just in preview, they didn't have more more to say.</p><p>More imminent are the IK Series of inductive keyswitches, which the company says will release in Fall of 2025. These switches work on a similar principle to Hall Effect switches, but with Cherry's own patented design, which they say consumes 5% of the power required for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-hall-effect-stick-replacements-now-available/1100-6528320/" data-ref-id="1100-6528320">Hall Effect switches</a> (and 50% of the power as compared to the aforementioned MK magnetic switches). According to Cherry, the IK switches feature "a robust, magnet- free metal-based design for enhanced reliability, analog precision, and long-term stability." This is coupled with "enhanced RGB lighting, customizable actuation, and ultra-low power usage."</p><p>However, if you prefer the traditional physical MX switch series--don't worry. Cherry still has you covered with three new switch offerings: MX Honey, MX Blossom, and MX Falcon.</p><p>The Honey switches are silent, tactile switches, meant to give the user the satisfying feedback of a tactile switch without the clicky-clack of traditional tactile switches. The MX Blossom switches, meanwhile, are the lightest linear mechanical switches the company has offered yet, with an actuation force of just 35 centinewtons (cN). For comparison, many of Cherry's other MX switches require between 60-70 cN, with others as low as 45 cN. So these switches are light and quiet. Finally, the MX Falcon switches are for heavy typists who want "bold feedback and a satisfying tactile punch," which the company says was inspired by the "crisp snap of typewriters." Even the look of the switch--which you won't see after installation unless you pull off the keycaps--was inspired by '90s retro design,' with a PC-beige-and-black housing and orange key stem.</p><p>These new MX switches will be available next month, with 36-switch consumer sets to follow a bit later.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is billing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" data-ref-id="5000-671281">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> as "the story leading into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>," giving players the chance to participate in the Imprisoning War that occurred during Hyrule's ancient past. According to developer Koei Tecmo, the game will also delve further into the lore and characters from this mysterious time period.</p><p>"This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom," Koei Tecmo's Yosuke Hayashi said during Nintendo's latest Creator's Voice video. "In this Hyrule Warriors game, you'll see how the people of Hyrule contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf."</p><p>Though the war is the focal point of the story, Age of Imprisonment will also offer a deeper look at Hyrule itself. "As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn't just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game. It also shows life in the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time," Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8ojj0HrzA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moreover, the game will shed light on some mysterious characters from this time period. As previously confirmed, King Rauru and Mineru will both be playable characters, but Matsushita teases that players will "also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."</p><p>Like previous Warriors games, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a large-scale action game that pits players against hundreds of enemies at a time, with more appearing on the battlefield than before thanks to Switch 2's added horsepower. "Nintendo Switch 2 has made it possible to include lots of enemies in our Warriors games," Matsushita explained.</p><p>"At the same time, it was also important that you could play with higher frame rates than the Nintendo Switch system. We were able to achieve that with this game," Hayashi added.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is slated to arrive "this winter," while the Switch 2 itself will launch on June 5 for $450. Nintendo is also offering a limited-time Mario Kart World bundle for $500, but this will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">only be available through Fall 2025</a>.</p>

Saber Interactive's new title, RoadCraft, takes a different approach. This game puts players in control of sites that have already been devastated by natural disasters and lets them choose how they want to rebuild the area around them.</p><p>RoadCraft is now out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2104890/view/563623871217927077" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and currently at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 35 on the platform's most-played titles</a> with just under 34,000 concurrent players. That's a very good start for a game considering the AAA titles it's competing with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> RoadCraft Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To a certain extent, RoadCraft is a crafting game, except it stays close to reality. Players can't simply take short cuts and skip past the clean up stage. Once the debris has been taken away, the rebuilding process begins. Laying down new roads is a part of that, but not the end. RoadCraft is designed to let the players decide where everything should go, and how they want to put it there.</p><p>RoadCraft allows players to utilize cranes, haulers, bulldozers, and other machines either solo or alongside up to three other players while coordinating with voice chat. Progression is shared and the game also supports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>.</p><p>There are eight different maps to reshape to your whims, included forested areas and deserts. Players can fully develop these locations or take a more minimal approach with the rebuild. It's entirely up to you, once the game is in your hands.</p><p>RoadCraft is currently on sale at Fanatical for $35.59, 11% off its regular price of $40. It's also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p><p><em><i>Disclosure: Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom</i>.</em></p>

                <p>According to leakers and data miners, code for double jumping and wall-running has been added to Call of Duty with the latest update, but it remains unclear if this will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> or Call of Duty 2025, if used at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Several reliable Call of Duty accounts on X: <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1924770383665745976" rel="nofollow ">CharlieIntel</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thebluefoxvn/status/1924328399679697079" rel="nofollow ">AndrewVN</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1924347527991541904" rel="nofollow ">COD Warfare</a>, all shared a look at the code in the new update, as well as video of it in action. It's important to note that the double jump and wall-running are not live in the actual game but instead are being demonstrated by someone who activated the code that was added. The movement looks similar to the movement in Black Ops 3, which originally introduced the controversial wall-running mechanic. It's been confirmed that a Black Ops 3 map, Fringe, is being remade for Black Ops 6 as part of Season 4. The map may not work without wall-running or significant changes, providing a possible reason for these being added.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what exactly this is being planned for, if it's going to be used at all, is unclear. It could be leftover code; it could be for a special mode in Black Ops 6 or used in this year's Call of Duty. While unannounced, it is rumored that Call of Duty 2025 is Black Ops 7 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">sequel to Black Ops 2</a>. Black Ops 2 had a near future sci-fi setting, but with the sequel coming out the same year the game was set, it would likely get bumped to a farther out date. It would make sense that the futuristic Call of Duty game brought back the futuristic mechanics of wall-running and double jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">The code was found as part of the most recent update to Call of Duty, which prepares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Warzone and Black Ops 6 for Season 4</a>, set to release on May 29.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone are set to expand in a big way this week with the arrival of Season 4. In this post, we're running through everything that's announced and rumored so far, including new weapons, more maps, a possible wall-running feature, and more. The full blog post covering everything that's new in Season 4 will be released on May 21, but for now, here's everything we know.</p><h2 id="Season_4_release_date"><strong>Season 4 release date</strong></h2><p>Season 4 for Black Ops 6 and Warzone will launch on May 29.</p><h2 id="Season_4_story_trailer">Season 4 story trailer</h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season continues the ongoing narrative, and that's no different for Season 4. In the new season, players can expect the return of a popular character--<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Vikhor_%22Stitch%22_Kuzmin" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stitch</a>.</p><p>"After a daring black site breakout staged by Adler, he strikes a deal with the devil. Crack the codes and unmask the Pantheon moles in Season 04 of Black Ops 6," reads a line from the description.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g-pQLuCHsk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6g-pQLuCHsk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="New_maps">New maps</h2><p>The <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Fringe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fringe map</a> from Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is coming to Black Ops 6's multiplayer in Season 4. It's expected to be just one of at least a few new maps, as Activision normally releases multiple new maps with each new season.</p><h2 id="New_operator"><strong>New operator</strong></h2><p>As the new cinematic alludes to, Season 4 is adding Stitch as a playable character, and he looks quite menacing. Also coming in Season 4 are a group of new skins for Adler. There could be more operators and more skins, and we'll find out soon when Activision releases all the new details for Season 4.</p><h2 id="Battle_pass"><strong>Battle pass</strong></h2><p>Of course, Season 4 will introduce a new battle pass. And while it hasn't been revealed yet, completing it will yield a rad new skin for Stitch that you can see below.</p><h2 id="New_weapons"><strong>New weapons</strong></h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season typically adds more weapons for everyone, and that seems to be the case for Season 4. Detonated reports that the LC10 and FFAR from Black Ops Cold War are coming to Black Ops 6, while the Essex Model 07 from Black Ops 4 is reportedly on the way as well.
