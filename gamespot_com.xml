                <p>The Game Awards, coming up this December 12, will honor 2024's best games, and Fortnite players will be able to vote on one category from within the game.</p><p>Studio 568 created a dedicated Fortnite island for event, and it's here where players can vote for the Best Fortnite Island of 2024. Additionally, host Geoff Keighley will show up in the game through a virtual avatar created by Epic's MetaHuman technology. Keighley flew to England to have himself scanned to create his digital likeness, and as you can see in the video below, it's pretty impressive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3JnlvOR5Xc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u3JnlvOR5Xc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite, as it's called, is a Fortnite hub world where players van visit the 10 creator-made islands that are in the running for Best Fortnite Island of 2024.

                <p>After multiple reports of compatibility issues, Microsoft has stopped automatically pushing Windows updates to PCs that have a variety of Ubisoft games installed, including Star Wars Outlaws, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.</p><p>The Windows 11 24H2 update has been in testing for most of 2024 and started rolling out to most users last month. Those who have updated and enjoyed some games from Ubisoft have reported instabilities with many titles, including startup issues and frequent crashes. Microsoft has become aware of the issues and is investigating, pausing automatic updates on Windows machines that have various Ubisoft titles installed. The company also recommends that players don't manually update until a fix has been found.</p><p>According to a post on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's known issues for 24H2</a>, it lists the following Ubisoft titles as having potential issues with the Windows update:</p><ul><li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li><li>Assassin's Creed Origins</li><li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li><li>Star Wars Outlaws</li><li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li></ul><p>Ubisoft has started trying to fix things on its end, with the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest patch for Star Wars Outlaws</a> providing a workaround if you have already updated to 24H2. The patch notes do say, however, that this fix isn't optimized and could still exhibit performance and stability issues until a permanent solution is found.</p><p>The best solution then is to avoid the 24H2 update entirely if you can, which should be easy enough now that Microsoft has taken action to prevent accidental automatic updates. You can roll back your Windows version via a new installation if you're stuck with the update and are struggling with some of the games listed above, as a fix from Microsoft or Ubisoft doesn't seem to be imminent.</p>

                <p>Deep Rock Galactic is getting a roguelite spin-off called Rogue Core, planned for early-access release in 2025. Watch the pre-alpha gameplay teaser below.</p><p>Rogue Core is based on the same structure as Deep Rock Galactic. It still takes place on the hostile but resource-rich planet of Hoxxes IV. You can still play with up to four players in co-op. You still play as gun-toting dwarves delving into the deep places of the earth. However, instead of working miners, you'll play as the more militaristic Reclaimers, sent to investigate the abandoned deep mines close to the planet's core.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core - Pre-Alpha Gameplay Teaser</p>
      </div>
<p>These deep mines were excavating Expenite, a rare mineral found only close to Hoxxes IV's heart. Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, you won't start a run fully equipped. Instead you'll use Expenite to upgrade your Reclaimer's weapons and equipment. If you are playing with friends, this becomes a "draft" where all players pick from the same set of options. What one player takes will be blocked off from another, so you'll have to strategize with your crew to maximize each upgrade's impact. You can also loot improvements from special rooms or by completing difficult challenges. In the final game there will be five (or more classes), but only two have been announced: the sword-toting Slicer and the drone-handling Falconeer. Rogue Core will also feature permanent progress between runs and spaceship hub called the RV-09 Ramrod.</p><p>As for the game's environment, the trailer shows off deep-sea floors with shifting stone walls, abandoned caverns flush with mining equipment, and the hostile, barren rock of the core itself. The closer you get to the center of the planet, and finishing your run, the more the game's biomes will resemble the hostility of the core. Rogue Core has new and returning enemies, including boss battles.</p><p>According to a blog post and developer Q&amp;A on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2605790/view/4482865501645572470" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Rogue Core started as an expansion to the base game, but it developed its own identity. Developer Ghost Ship Games also wished to put Rogue Core in early access, which it couldn't do if it were DLC. The game is currently in pre-alpha and Ghost Ship plans to release it in early access sometime in 2025.</p>

                <p>Activision has announced more details around Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 that speak to the game's popularity, though the publisher has not disclosed a sales number for the title as of yet.</p><p>In a statement, Activision said Black Ops 6 is now the "biggest Call of Duty ever" over its first 30 days when it comes to total players, total hours played, and total matches played. Before this, Activision said Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/#:~:text=Black%20Ops%206%20Had%20A,500%20Million%20Units%20Sold%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">broke records for the same categories over its first three days.</a></p><p>Developer Treyarch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861096257374056822" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thanked fans for their support</a> and announced that a double XP weekend for Black Ops 6 will begin this Wednesday, November 27. That's a few days before the actual weekend, but Treyarch is no doubt kicking things off early due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the US.</p><p>In addition to double XP, Black Ops 6 is adding new multiplayer playlists on November 27. These include Prop Hunt, Stakeout 24/7, and Hardcore Stakeout 24/7.</p><p>Big numbers for Black Ops 6 were expected prior to launch. Not only is the Black Ops brand highly popular, but the game launched into Game Pass, opening the game up to a potentially larger playerbase.

At a higher level, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-microsoft-doesnt-share-xbox-one-sales-numbers/1100-6435219/" data-ref-id="1100-6435219">doesn't even disclose Xbox console sales numbers anymore</a>, as the company instead focuses on ambiguous "engagement" metrics that can be spun and positioned to Microsoft's benefit.</p><p>Black Ops 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/" data-ref-id="2900-5979">No. 1 best-selling game of October 2024 in the US</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 3 best-selling game overall after just a few days on sale.</a></p>
