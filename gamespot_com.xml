                <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025, parent company Take-Two announced as part of its earnings briefing today. Some expected Rockstar to announce a delay given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">Rockstar's history of delaying its big games</a>, but it did not happen.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said there is "always a risk of slippage," but he feels "really good" about the game making it out on time in Fall 2025.</p><p>"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p>GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has now sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold. One company believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">GTA VI can sell 40 million units and drive $3 billion in revenue during its first year alone.</a></p><p>Rockstar's other juggernaut series, Red Dead Redemption, continues to soar as well. Red Dead Redemption II has now sold 70 million copies, up from 67 million just three months ago. </p><p>GTA VI is not the only big game that Take-Two has in the works for 2025, as the company is also launching Sid Meier's Civilization VII on February 11, PGA Tour 2K25 on February 28, and WWE 2K25 on March 14. Looking beyond that, Take-Two has Mafia: The Old Country lined up for Summer 2025, with GTA VI landing in Fall 2025, and Borderlands 4 at some point in calendar 2025.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a> debuted last summer shortly before the start of the current NFL season, so it's fitting that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-revealed-for-february-2025-including-starfield-for-standard-tier/2900-6219/" data-ref-id="2900-6219">arrived on Game Pass today</a> before the end of the post-season. That means Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can run their own Super Bowl simulations before the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles meet again on Sunday.</p><p>EA has traditionally released its Madden NFL Super Bowl predictions ahead of the game, but the publisher has yet to do so this year. Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-super-bowl-predictions-over-the-years-how-often-does-ea-get-it-right/1100-6487137/" data-ref-id="1100-6487137">Madden NFL's Super Bowl projections</a> have only been right six out of the last 13 years, which gives it a 46% accuracy rating. Some years are closer than others, but Madden NFL successfully picked the exact score for Super Bowl 49 before the New England Patriots downed the Seattle Seahawks 28-24.</p><p>You may have noticed that the cover athlete for Madden NFL 25--Christian McCaffrey--doesn't play for either the Chiefs or the Eagles. Instead, McCaffrey is a running back for the San Francisco 49ers who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-cover-athlete-christian-mccaffrey-injured-will-miss-4-games/1100-6526490/" data-ref-id="1100-6526490">spent some time on the injured list</a> this year, reviving talk about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-bowl-2020-patrick-mahomes-and-the-madden-cur/1100-6473047/" data-ref-id="1100-6473047">the infamous Madden curse</a>. The reality is that football is a physically taxing sport, and almost every player deals with injuries at some point. That hasn't stopped Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase from proclaiming that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfls-best-wide-receiver-is-aware-of-madden-curse-doesnt-want-to-be-cover-star/1100-6528594/" data-ref-id="1100-6528594">he's aware of the so-called curse</a>, and doesn't want to be a Madden NFL cover star.</p><p>Madden NFL 26 will likely arrive this summer, but it has yet to receive an official announcement from EA. Although it's been 13 years since Madden appeared on a Nintendo console, EA is very optimistic about the franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/" data-ref-id="1100-6529253">making a comeback on Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is capable of running at up to 60fps on Xbox Series X, game director Carrie Patel has confirmed.</p><p>Patel said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtStowg2Rk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, "You can get up to 60[fps]" on Xbox Series X. The use of "can" here might indicate an alternative graphics mode that prioritizes image quality over frame rate, but we don't know for sure as of yet.</p><p>The frame rate reaching 60fps on Series X is newsworthy in part because Obsidian previously said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-will-be-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-allowing-for-juicier-visual-effects/1100-6526077/" data-ref-id="1100-6526077">only capable of reaching 30fps on Xbox Series X.</a> Obsidian said this decision was made early on in the development of the game and has allowed the studio to get "a lot juicier" with visual effects. Things have changed since then, though, and Avowed can now run at a higher frame rate on Series X.</p><p>Patel also told fans to expect some amount of bugs and issues. "You gotta accept a little jank to do something fun and creative, I think," Patel said.</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>Avowed is Obsidian's first new release since 2022's Pentiment. It's not Obsidian's only in-development project, either, as the studio is also making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-steelbook-premium-edition-is-up-for-preorder-comes-with-five-day-early-access/1100-6527801/" data-ref-id="1100-6527801">Avowed preorder guide.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For the first week of each Content Commissioner takeover, players will "chase glory together to complete Community challenges and ultimately determine how many Apex Packs will be up for grabs the following week," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/takeover-game-updates" rel="nofollow ">a new blog post</a> on the official Apex Legends website.</p><p dir="ltr">The community goals for the first week of each takeover are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 1 challenges:</strong> 10 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 2 challenges:</strong> 15 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 3 challenges:</strong> 20 Apex Packs earnable</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The second week of each takeover is when players will get a chance to earn those Apex Packs. Players will be faced with five in-game challenges. Players who complete all five will gain access to the Apex Packs they unlocked during the previous week, along with a special Creator Commissioner-selected Legendary-tier weapon skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also earn a free banner frame via Twitch Drops if they tune in to a Twitch stream from an approved Apex Legends content creator. A free Creator Commissioner-themed stat tracker will be available for players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-send-gifts-in-apex-legends/1100-6508429/">gift to their friends</a> via the in-game store.</p><p dir="ltr">The Apex Legends Season 24 Creator Commissioners schedule--and the Legendary-tier skins they've chosen for their two-week time in the spotlight--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 25 - March 10:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ninjayla">Ninjayla</a> (Legendary skin: Death Ray Wingman)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>March 11 - 24:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oraxe">Oraxe</a> (Legendary skin: The Pioneer Kraber)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>April 1 - 14:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apryze">Apryze</a> (Legendary skin: Bone Breaker Mastiff)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>April 15 - 28:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaminariqpi/">Kaminari Qpi</a> (Legendary skin: Tombstick Mastiff)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Respawn hasn't yet announced which limited-time modes will be available during the Creator Commissioner takeovers, though more information is likely to be shared when the Season 24 patch notes are released. The trailer did mention that both Ash and Ballistic were buffed, and details on those changes will also be available once patch notes are live.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also gave players a glimpse of the game's new Arsenals: special Loot Bins available in battle royale mode that include a weapon, ammo for that weapon, and a special attachment or hop-up for that weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 24: Takeover begins on Tuesday, February 11 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NASA will be hosting its first-ever Twitch stream from the International Space Station (ISS) next week. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the announcement via its official X (formerly Twitter) account, and shared some details on what viewers can expect from the stream.</p><p dir="ltr">"This Twitch event from space is the first of many," said Brittany Brown, who directs NASA's Office of Communications Digital and Technology Division. "We spoke with digital creators at TwitchCon about their desire for streams designed with their communities in mind, and we listened. In addition to our spacewalks, launches, and landings, we’ll host more Twitch-exclusive streams like this one. Twitch is one of the many digital platforms we use to reach new audiences and get them excited about all things space."</p><p>The stream itself will take place on the ISS--roughly 250 miles above Earth's surface--and will feature appearances from NASA astronauts Don Pettit (who is currently aboard the ISS) and Matt Dominick (who recently returned to Earth after participating in NASA's Crew-8 mission). The spacefaring duo will discuss topics like daily life aboard the ISS and the microgravity experiments currently being performed on board, while also highlighting "ways for Twitch users to engage with NASA, including citizen science projects and science, technology, engineering, and math programs designed to inspire the Artemis Generation."</p><p dir="ltr">The Artemis Generation refers to the astronauts who will explore Earth's moon as a part of NASA's Artemis Program.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon," the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/" rel="nofollow ">official Artemis Program website</a> reads. "NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time NASA has conducted a Twitch livestream, nor is it the first time the agency has broadcast a livestream from the ISS. But according to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-goes-live-first-twitch-stream-from-space-station/" rel="nofollow ">official NASA website</a>, "This conversation will be the first NASA event [livestreamed] from the International Space Station developed specifically for the agency’s Twitch platform."</p><p>The stream will take place on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa">NASA's Twitch channel</a> on Wednesday, February 12 at 8:45 AM PT / 11:45 AM ET.</p>
