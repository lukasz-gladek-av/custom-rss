                <p>Julian LeFay, widely regarded as "the father of The Elder Scrolls", has passed away at the age of 59, following what his studio described as a "courageous battle with cancer." His death was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms/posts/4441113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed by OnceLost Games</a>, the studio he co-founded, which called his passing "an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry."</p><p>According to CEO Ted Peterson, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/father-of-elder-scrolls-stepping-away-from-industry-due-to-ailing-health/1100-6533230/" data-ref-id="1100-6533230">LeFay stepped away from work just a week before his death</a>, choosing to spend his final days surrounded by family. Despite his illness, he remained actively involved in development, continuing to guide the team, mentor younger developers, and help shape The Wayward Realms to reflect his signature design philosophy and creative ambition.</p><p>Lefay was a key figure behind The Elder Scrolls: Arena and Daggerfall, two titles that laid the foundation for one of the most influential franchises in gaming history. His legacy was so deeply embedded in the series that the in-game deity Julianos was named in his honor. In 2019, LeFay teamed up with fellow former Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman to establish OnceLost Games, announcing their ambitious new RPG, The Wayward Realms, in 2021.</p><p>OnceLost Games affirmed that work on the game will continue in LeFay's honor, stating that the team is dedicated to realizing the vision he helped build. "Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," the statement reads. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder players experience in The Wayward Realms."</p><p>The statement goes on to say that while "this is an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry," development on the game will continue. The team is committed to honoring LeFayâ€™s legacy by bringing his vision to life.</p><p>The tribute concludes: "Julian's impact reaches far beyond our studio. He touched millions of players worldwide and inspired generations of developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder in The Wayward Realms."</p>
