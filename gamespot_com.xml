                <p>If you've come across The Stench of Corruption quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you may be wondering how to find and complete each of its objectives. It can be challenging to round up each location you need to visit, after all, and find out exactly what to interact with in each spot. Luckily, we've got you covered below.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out The Stench of Corruption, follow the steps below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</a></li><li><a href="#Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</a></li><li><a href="#Search_the_room_for_any_clues_of_the_saboteur_s_identity">Search the room for any clues of the saboteur's identity</a></li><li><a href="#Reach_the_tunnels_below_the_Spaceport">Reach the tunnels below the Spaceport</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_key_on_any_Flushing_Terminal_to_override_the_bypass_protocol">Use the key on any Flushing Terminal to override the bypass protocol</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</h2><p>Your first stop is the Departure Building on Spaceport, which can be found near the middle of the map, just west of the Launch Tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282" data-ratio="0.56416028815849" data-width="2221" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282"></a><figcaption>Departure Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg"></figure><p>Since you'll be visiting the southwest lobby for the next part of the quest, we'd recommend approaching the building from that direction anyway.</p><h2 id="Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</h2><p>The staff locker room is located in the southwest lobby on the bottom floor of the Departure Building.

Whether that was worth it to you once you see how it looks is another story, though. But hey, everyone likes different things, right?

Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale.</p><p>Interested in other retro gaming solutions?

                <p>Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.</p><p>Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!</p><p>Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.</p><p>Check out yours (login required): <a href="https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4</a>… <a href="https://t.co/SrVS9oNdIP" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP</a></p></div>  — Steam (@Steam) <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week.</a> To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=replay%2F%3Fsnr%3D1_4_4__118%26snr%3D1_4_4__118&amp;redir_ssl=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">click the Steam Replay banner</a> in the Steam app's store page. It'll be interesting to see how the Steam Machine will affect players next year for those who prefer a more traditional console setup.</p><p>There are a few limits to keep in mind: Steam Replay does not count time played while offline or disconnected from the internet. It also leaves out unreleased games, preloads, prerelease versions, and disabled games.</p>

                <p>The success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game.</p><p>"It's more pressure," Larian founder Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/swen-vincke-says-theres-definitely-more-pressure-to-nail-divinity-after-the-smash-success-of-baldurs-gate-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.</p><p>"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'" added Vincke. "By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn."</p><p>Vincke recently came under fire for saying that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">Larian uses some generative AI</a> in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to "explore things" and that it allows artists to "experiment" and "make their lives easier." He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.</p><p>According to Vincke, Divinity will probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/" data-ref-id="1100-6537011">get an early-access release</a> like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.</p><h2>How to complete A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step to completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders is to head back to the drain where you previously found the barrel for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-source-of-the-contamination-quest-guide/1100-6535935/" data-ref-id="1100-6535935">Source of the Contamination</a> quest. This barrel can be found outside the Water Treatment Center on the Dam Battlegrounds map by approaching from the north via the swamp. Check the map below for the exact spot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157"></a><figcaption>Water Treatment Control drain location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg"></figure><p>This time, you won't need to interact with the barrel. Instead, simply walk around in this nasty water for a moment to trigger the next step of the quest, which asks you to find traces of the barrel's origin. Luckily, you won't need to travel far at all to round up where the barrel came from.</p><p>Walk to the west just a bit to find a truck in the swamp water. It's hard to miss since it's sitting out in the open, but we've marked the location on the map for you below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158"></a><figcaption>Find a truck submerged in the water here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Approach the truck and interact with the prompt that shows up to take a photo of it. Afterward, you'll receive a final task to search the trucks for clues about who sabotaged the water supply. Just interact with the door of the truck to find a Spaceport Warehouse Key. Pick it up and place it in your safe pocket, as it can come in handy for finding good loot next time you're in Spaceport.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156"></a><figcaption>This truck is the source of the contamination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that you're finished with the quest, you can extract at the nearby Central Swamp Lift. Just be mindful that this area can be easily camped by other raiders, so keep your wits about you. When you return to Speranza and turn this quest in, you'll receive a follow-up quest called The Stench of Corruption, which you'll need to complete if you want to earn the Warden outfit.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

                <p>Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p>For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><p>If you're playing on Xbox or PC, you can access Black Ops 7 with Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass.

This could help explain why Activision is offering a discount on the game about a month after launch, though there could be other reasons as well.</p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's initial sales may have been lower, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game in the US so far.</a> On December 17, we will find out from Circana how Black Ops 7 sold in the US, though the game's availability on Game Pass will put an asterisk on its sales performance.</p>
