                <p>The difference between real and generated frames is a hotly contested topic, especially when it comes to their prevalence in PC gaming. Nvidia and AMD have made big improvements to their own solutions for predicting and simulating frames that can be inserted in-between real ones spat out by your GPU, and now Steam is making it a little easier to determine the difference between the two.</p><p>In an update to its in-game performance tools, Valve has added the ability to differentiate between frames generated by your hardware, and ones generated by your pick for frame generation, whether it's Nvidia's DLSS suite or AMD's FSR toolset. A new frames-per-second counter can show you what frame rate you're currently seeing with frame generation on, and what is actually being rendered by the game, which can be useful to determine issues with the technology.</p>

<p>Usually, issues arise with frame generation when your base frame rate isn't high enough, creating a mismatch between the responsiveness of the game and the fluidity you see on-screen. Valve's approach lets you determine if your settings are still a bit too demanding for your hardware by letting you see the true frame rate at a glance, so that you can make adjustments to fine-tune this balance.</p><p>The update also adds more information to the overlay, including additional GPU and CPU utilization information, maximum and minimum frame rates, a frame rate graph, and more. You can choose between four display levels in the in-game overlay settings, as well as the color and opacity of the display to suit the game they're being layered onto.</p><p>Valve says this update is specifically for Windows users now, and for modern GPU hardware. Additional support will come at a later, undetermined date. You can find out more about how Valve calculates all of its performance metrics in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">detailed breakdown here</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> livestream for The Edge of Fate, which is set for release on July 15, Bungie developers explained how they expect players to sequence break the new planet of Kepler--and that's intentional.</p><p>The new destination of Kepler is described as being similar in depth to the Rise of Iron content from the original game in 2016. It was complex with many puzzles and mysteries to solve. The Edge of Fate's content has been designed so that the campaign missions "slowly" lead players into unlocking different abilities and the varying levels of them, as well as uncovering more of Kepler's explorable areas.</p><p>There are puzzles to figure out, secrets to unlock, and particular routes that will be inaccessible without using abilities, such as Matterspark, to shrink down and traverse through vents or hidden paths. During the stream, Bungie developers explained that this was done in order to teach players that it's necessary to look at and think about the world around them in a different way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After the main campaign story missions are complete, you can unlock abilities anywhere, but this means that you can sequence break puzzles and missions. Bungie says that this is "entirely intentional" and that it is looking forward to seeing what players can do beyond the limits of its own playtesting processes.</p><p>"We're not 100% sure where players might sequence break," said Destiny 2 assistant game director, Robbie Stevens, "but that's intentional."</p><p>With the news that players breaking Destiny 2 is finally intended by Bungie, it'll be interesting to watch the varied combinations and broken builds created by players in action.</p><p>Where Bungie draws a stricter line though is its raids, with many items and abilities being disabled for the Contest Mode versions of its raid races. During the stream, Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid race start date</a>, and detailed the new Epic raid system that will be available shortly after its release.</p>

                <p>In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>developer livestream, Bungie has detailed the start date for The Edge of Fate raid race, and it may signal some changes to the traditional raid race experience that players are used to.</p><p>For the past few expansions, Guardians have had 48 hours to complete the raid race on Contest Mode. Contest Mode is a time-limited version of the race that is available as soon as the raid is released. It has inflated difficulty in the form of reduced outgoing damage, higher combatant health, and a reliance on flawless team communication and strategy. These traditionally began on the Friday following the release of the expansion on Tuesday, but this time around that's changing.</p><p><strong>The Edge of Fate raid race will begin on Saturday, July 19</strong>.</p><p>We assume that it will still begin at the daily reset time, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, several weeks after the raid's initial release, a new version of the raid will become available. This is known as an Epic version of the raid and will expand the story, adding new content. Bungie emphasized that it is not holding anything back in the base version of the raid to enable the Epic version to exist, but rather that the Epic raid will "enhance" the raid experience.</p><p>For those wondering about how to prepare for the race in the four short days between the expansion's release and the launch of the raid, Bungie recommends completing the campaign's main story on Legendary difficulty to reach the recommended Power level.</p><p>Guardians can further enhance their preparation by grinding for more powerful gear, which can drop at higher tiers with more benefits when completing difficult activities. With the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">new Exotics</a>, armor, and modifiers, this raid race will be one to watch.</p>

                <p>Remasters and ports are big business, and when Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition was announced, hardcore fans who played the original 2011 version were excited. That excitement quickly turned to frustration as the PC release contained a number of bugs, and Sega is now offering refunds to everyone who bought it.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169520/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine__Master_Crafted_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, there are almost 100 "mostly negative" reviews citing buggy loads, ugly UI changes, and constant crashing, leaving fans disappointed. "Decided to pick up a copy after the price was reduced for Anniversary Edition owners as some goodwill was returned," one player wrote. "Have played less than an hour and got sent into bugsplat just navigating the menus, all of which are a downgrade compared to the original. No idea why Relic have decided to fix what's not broken here."</p><p>Sega dropped the price to $20 for anyone who already owns the Anniversary Edition, and as <a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> is reporting, letting fans who already purchased it on PC get a refund through July 10. Sega also laid out improvements that Patch 3 was to implement, including "fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens" and more technical fixes like moving local user profile data to a different location to prevent certain crashes. </p><p>However, the game's problems go outside PC players. Xbox Series X|S players--who play the game via Game Pass Ultimate--are also experiencing a bug that's eating their save files. It's such a common complaint that players are sharing their stories over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> to see if there's any possible solution, as refunds aren't available on that platform yet.</p><p>If you're too frustrated to keep playing but still want your Warhammer goodness, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-you-can-get-a-free-warhammer-40k-game-this-week/1100-6532330/" data-ref-id="1100-6532330">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</a> is on supersale right now over at GOG. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is available on current-gen consoles and PC, and was such a success that a third game is already in the works.</p>

                <p>Crash Bandicoot may not be as popular as he used to be, but three decades ago he was one of PlayStation's first breakout original characters. But when former Sony executive Shuji Utsumi attempted to get Hollywood interested in making a Crash Bandicoot movie, he was given the cold shoulder by film executives.</p><p>Utsumi--who is currently the CEO of Sega of America--told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/reviving-sega-will-be-the-greatest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about his attempt to bring Crash Bandicoot to the big screen. Despite the success of the games--from 1996 to 2010, Sony released a Crash-related game nearly every year--no one seemed to share Utsumi's vision for what the film could be.</p><p>"When I started to get involved in the video game business, I picked up Crash Bandicoot and started asking some of the movie studios if they were interested in turning that property into a movie," recalled Utsumi. "But I was treated like, 'hey, video games is like a toy business.' They didn't really take it seriously."</p><p>Utsumi went on to note that the Sonic the Hedgehog movies have proven to be very successful for both Hollywood--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-franchise-races-past-1-billion-at-the-box-office/1100-6528632/" data-ref-id="1100-6528632">the film franchise has pulled in more than $1 billion</a>--and for Sega itself in terms of boosting game sales and Sonic's status as an iconic character. Crash Bandicoot, however, has seen better days. Developer Toys for Bob made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-review-/1900-6417574/" data-ref-id="1900-6417574">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> in 2020, but the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">canceled plans to produce Crash Bandicoot 5</a>.</p><p>Although the Crash Bandicoot games were originally developed by Naughty Dog, the rights to the character are currently held by Microsoft after its purchase of Activision Blizzard. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/want-a-crash-bandicoot-movie-ask-xbox-the-last-of-us-boss-says/1100-6531823/" data-ref-id="1100-6531823">expressed his support for a Crash Bandicoot movie</a>, but he also reiterated that it's Microsoft's call whether to actually pursue that project.</p>
