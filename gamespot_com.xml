                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-tanks-review/1900-6342098/" data-ref-id="1900-6342098">World of Tanks</a> lets players engage in simulated war battles, but the real war between Russia and Ukraine has led to Lesta Games--the Russian studio behind the game--facing charges that it illegally funneled money from its title to Ukraine.</p><p>The original developer of World of Tanks is WargamingUnited, a company that withdrew from Russia and Belarus directly because of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Wargaming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">has also raised money in support of Ukraine</a>, which would be a crime under current Russian law. Lesta Games--which took over the local Russian rights for World of Tanks--has repeatedly stressed that it has no relationship with Wargaming. That wasn't enough to prevent Russia from seizing control of Lesta Games.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/russia-assures-world-of-tanks-players-they-wont-end-up-in-prison-as-it-takes-full-control-of-the-studio-in-charge-of-it-domestically-accusing-it-of-funnelling-funds-to-ukraine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Moscow has frozen all assets that belong to Lesta Games, and accused the company's co-founder, Malik Khatazhaev, of being part of an "extremist group" under the control of Wargaming CEO Viktor Kisly. The evidence cited in court reportedly drew upon footage of Wargaming's support for Ukraine.</p><p>Russian media is reportedly telling World of Tanks players in the country that they won't be arrested for spending money on the game that might have gone to Ukraine. Duma's Information Technology Committee's deputy chairman, Anton Gorelkin, also told players that Lesta Games' assets will likely be handed over to "a specialized Russian company."</p><p>It bears repeating that the World of Tanks game rights in Russia are only limited to that country. Wargaming still has its World of Tanks assets and rights in other countries. Lesta Games isn't the only video game developer to be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Developer GSC Game World continued to develop <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> even as some of the devs either fled the country or remained to fight. The story of those developers was told in GameSpot's documentary, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">How Stalker 2 Survived a War</a>.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is out today, and immediately someone has smashed it with a hammer. In the video below from YouTube account TechRex, we see the host perform an extreme durability test on the console, culminating in a test that the Switch 2 was never going to survive.</p><p>The test begins with a simple drop test, where the Switch 2 is dropped from a tabletop height. As you can see in the video, the Switch 2 survives multiple five-foot drops with no issues, at least in this specific test environment. The video also has the host slashing the Switch 2's screen with a box cutter trying to snap off the Joy-Cons improperly, and attempting to apply force to break the kickstand.</p><p>Finally, the host drops a hammer on the screen and then smashes it with a lot more force. It's painful to type these words and even more painful to watch the video, but alas, here it is for your own enjoyment or punishment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p33K1uuOk-A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>No mass-market technology product is designed to withstand the kind of abuse that TechRex subjected the Switch 2 in this video. But it's good to know the Switch 2 has a fighting chance to survive a drop from a day-to-day height like a coffee table or dining table. </p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-remove-switch-2s-protective-film-nintendo-says/1100-6531977/" data-ref-id="1100-6531977">officially recommends that you keep the Switch 2's film screen on</a>, but that likely would not protect it from scratches with a box cutter. For that, you might want to invest in a tempered screen protector, or make changes to your personal life.</p><p>If you're unlucky enough to need a repair for your Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-2-owners-have-holes-in-their-screen-thanks-to-gamestop/1100-6532136/" data-ref-id="1100-6532136">or if GameStop stapled your Switch 2 screen</a>), you can <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay Nintendo for an official repair</a>. Also worth mentioning is how the Switch 2 packaging itself does not contain much in the way of protection for the console.</p><p>The Switch 2 launched today, June 5, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> as its marquee <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch title</a>. The game is enjoying a positive critical response, though it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-missing-one-feature-people-really-wanted/1100-6532133/" data-ref-id="1100-6532133">does not include one feature many wanted to see.</a></p>

                <p>If you're a member of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">Switch 2 upgrades for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a> come included with your subscription. But how exactly you access those upgrades can be mildly confusing, so be warned.</p><p>When you transfer your data from a Switch to Switch 2, it will start downloading various software from your old system. Once it's done downloading one of the Zelda games, you might think the rest happens automatically--but no. Instead, starting up Tears of the Kingdom starts the Switch version, with a menu option at the bottom to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Selecting that menu item forwards you to the Nintendo eShop store page, or you can find the store pages manually.</p><p>But here's where the process may trip up unsuspecting Hyrulians. The store page displays two different buttons. On the left side, next to the "Online + Expansion Pack" label, is "Download." On the right side is "Continue." The Continue button is noticeably much bigger and brighter, and located where you'd usually go to complete a transaction. But the free option for subscribers is the "Download" button.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507548" data-ratio="0.55186509964231" data-width="1957" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507548"></a><figcaption>Tears of the Kingdom's eShop page</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4507548-switchzeldaupgrade.jpg"></figure><p>You can still hit Continue to buy the content, which means you would continue to have access to it even if you let your Switch Online subscription lapse. But if that won't be a problem for you, there's no reason to pay the $10 premium. Purchasing the upgrade will prompt a second download, after which you'll need to restart the software if you had it running.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has just launched, which means lots of fans are getting their first hands-on with the games, including the launch lineup like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/love-weird-lil-guys-mario-kart-world-is-the-game-for-you/1100-6532028/" data-ref-id="1100-6532028">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-is-a-surprising-stem-showpiece-but-it-should-still-be-free/1100-6532015/" data-ref-id="1100-6532015">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.

                <p>The midnight launch of the Switch 2 went off relatively smoothly in the US, but one group of customers were in for a nasty surprise when they got home to unwrap their new console. It looks like one GameStop branch was a little too heavy-handed with the stapler, as customers are reporting that they unboxed their Switch 2 and discovered ghastly puncture holes right in the shiny new screen.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/midnight_release_went_bad_for_me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a> (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), customers showed up to a GameStop located in Staten Island, and after purchasing a Switch 2, their receipt was stapled to the box. It's worth noting that the Switch 2 box has thin cardboard, and the Switch 2 itself sits right underneath the flap with its screen facing up, so it's not surprising that a quick whack with a stapler would result in damage to the screen.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">[image or embed]</a></p></div>  — Wario64 (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@wario64.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">June 5, 2025 at 9:18 AM</a></blockquote>

                <p>After years of rumors and speculation, Final Fantasy Tactics is heading to modern consoles with a remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/" data-ref-id="1100-6532075">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. Director Kazutoyo Maehiro, art director Hiroshi Minagawa, and original script, scenario writer, and editor Yasumi Matsuno <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all gave statements about the remaster</a>. However, it was Matsuno who opened up about the political backdrop of the story and how it's still more relevant than ever.</p><p>The story of FFT centers around two men, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral, who come from completely different backgrounds but initially have similar goals. Eventually, their lives fork off in massively different directions and they find themselves now at odds with one another.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles - Announcement Trailer</p>

<p>"Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole, it was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag," Matsuno said.</p><p>Matsuno had made a career of injecting heavy politics into his stories. Before FFT, he had helped create the Ogre Battle series. Fans might remember Ogre Battle (originally Ogre Battle: Let Us Cling Together) for the PlayStation, having similar tones and story structure. Atlus even pushed back the North American release to limit the competition with FFT, but also to get the attention of players who liked FFT on board with its game.</p><p>"Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system," he continued. "It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine. And now, in 2025--a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society--I offer this story once again."</p><p>Matsuno signed off with "the will to resist is in your hands."</p><p>Despite being in the shadow of Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy Tactics has become a cult classic over the years, with Ivalice becoming a mainstay in FF lore.</p><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is scheduled for release on September 30 on PS4 and PS5. </p>
