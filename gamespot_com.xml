                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is an online multiplayer extraction shooter that features PvE as well as PvP systems. You can run in and shoot NPC enemies or, if you're feeling particularly violent, you can blast player-controlled characters. But for developer Embark Studios, the latter isn't really the point of the game, so don't expect more PvP systems in the future.</p><p>In <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video playthrough</a> with GamesBeat on December 30 (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund explained that the team isn't planning on adding anything like PvP leaderboards because the PvP environment merely creates tension in the game. It isn't the bedrock on which the rest of the game was built.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Arc Raiders Solo Experience Changed My Brain</p>
      </div>
<p>"We've had several discussions about Nemesis systems and all types of things," he said. "I don't know where the team [is] on them right now. I think one of the beauties of this game is the fact that we don't have those leaderboards, and it's not competitive. We don't want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay. The game isn't about shooting other players. You can do that if you want to, but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension."</p><p>There's a risk-reward system at play when you embark in Arc Raiders, as you make calculated assessments on the situations around you. Söderlund said that, in one iteration of the game, other players weren't visible, but bringing them in and making the game an online multiplayer environment further enhanced that tension as you determined the risks you're willing to take.</p><p>"The game was without other players for a long time," Söderlund said. "And yes, there were instances where the game was fun, and there were areas where it worked quite well. But also, the minute you added other players and then use subtle ways of signaling--you don't know how many players are on the server, you don't know how many players have died, you don't know how many players are around you--but we signal to you that there are other players. You hear them shooting. That's why audio is a very important part of this game. You hear them encountering Arc and other players. You see the raider flares as they go down. At one point--it was funny--I came back into a playtest, and the raider flares were gone. I'm like, 'Why did you remove those?' And they're like, 'Well, well…' So I just said, 'Just bring them back.' They're such an iconic part of this game."</p><p>This tension, as well as the myriad players you could encounter as you shot your way through Arc Raiders, made the game feel alive and populated in a way that was missing during developmental playtests. Söderlund once again emphasized that tension, but said that other players were only one part of the equation. The sound, the enemies, the world--these make up the rest of it.</p><p>Speaking of tension, Arc Raiders is fielding some intense pressure lately. The game has come under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI for things like voice lines</a>, with Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">defending the technology</a>, saying it's beneficial for developers and players. Still, the game continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">a huge success for the Swedish studio</a>, so much so that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Embark Studios has received movie and TV offers</a>.</p>

                <p>More than a decade after its last release, Carmageddon is returning with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carmageddon-rogue-shift/" data-ref-id="5000-705080">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Developed by Redout studio 34BigThings, this spin-off casts players as a faceless driver in a world wrecked by war, disasters, and an inconvenient zombie apocalypse triggered by megacorporations.</p><p>Zombies--called the Wasted in this universe--overwhelm humans while players clash in deadly races for power, prestige, and a chance to escape the chaos by catching a rocket off Earth. While this sounds par for the Carmageddon course, the catch here is that Rogue Shift leans heavily into roguelite gameplay. Players drive through randomly generated paths and tackle events to seize upgrade credits, and even if you crash out, permanent bonuses unlocked with beatcoins grant you an edge for your next run.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFmSbChgC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each run will require you to carefully plot your destination, as your ride will require repairs along the way. Difficulty also increases dynamically, but finding the right synergies between vehicles, perks, and weapons will help you build the ultimate killing machine that can be used against the Wasted hordes or other drivers roaming the streets.</p><p>34BigThings says there are 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to choose from, and each of the 15 unlockable vehicles has unique handling characteristics related to their drivetrain, weight, center of mass, suspensions, tire friction, and pressure.</p><p>"We made Carmageddon: Rogue Shift to challenge you in a way that keeps you coming back. Our goal is to get you into that flow, firing-on-all-cylinders flow state we fondly remember from the original Carmageddon games and, more in general, the combat racing games that defined the genre," head of design Giuseppe Enrico Franchi wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/06/carmageddon-rogue-shift-new-gameplay-details-on-the-roguelike-racer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was one of 2025's biggest success stories in gaming, and it's keeping up the momentum in 2026, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">January 4 becoming the game's biggest day ever in terms of daily users</a>. The game was originally going to be a free-to-play title, but it changed to $40 ahead of launch. Why $40? Embark Studios boss Patrick Soderlund said in an interview that the decision to switch from free to premium came after the team saw the success of Helldivers 2, which was also priced at $40.</p><p>"We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" he told <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=NXyvhtFgKyZ2B6nb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p><p>The executive added that $40 was the right price for Arc Raiders also because it helped the game avoid being an "offender" for players. The game has no campaign and is 100% multiplayer.</p><p>"We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be," he explained.</p><p>Arc Raiders has now reportedly sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">12 million copies across all platforms</a>, driving more than $350 million in revenue.</p><p>Arc Raiders and developer Embark are owned by South Korean game giant Nexon.
