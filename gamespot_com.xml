                <p>Star Wars: Battlefront II's best and most complete version is currently free to keep on Xbox, but only for a limited time and only for EA Play members. Now through December 20, EA Play members can grab the 2017 game for the nice price of $0.00. EA Play is included with Game Pass Ultimate, so those subscribers get the game free as well.</p><p>The version of Battlefront II that's free is the Celebration Edition, which includes the base game and all past free updates. It has almost all of the content that was previously sold as DLC and microtransactions, so you're getting pretty much the complete package.</p><p>The Celebration Edition originally launched in December 2019 priced at $40, following on from the standard edition's debut in 2017. If you're not an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate member, you can still get the Celebration Edition for a great price, as it's currently marked down to only $4.</p><p>Battlefront II had a challenging launch in 2017, as the game's early-access debut was criticized for its use of loot boxes. EA removed these in time for the game's public launch, though, and the game steadily grew and improved with new maps and modes over the years.</p><p>The new Battlefront games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell more than 35 million copies</a>, but EA was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch from DICE for a third game</a> due to licensing costs. While the modern Battlefront series didn't continue, the classic Battlefront games were re-released earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-review-fire-away/1900-6418207/" data-ref-id="1900-6418207">to a poor critical reception.</a></p><p>After Battlefront II, DICE would go on to release Battlefield V in 2018 and Battlefield 2042 in 2021. DICE is now working with a network of other studios on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">the next Battlefield</a>, which returns to a modern-day setting and is reportedly on tap to launch in October 2025.</p><p>As for the Star Wars video game series, some of the upcoming games include Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream and the next Star Wars Jedi game from Respawn, among others.</p>

Speaking to Conner Mather (<a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1868620511061627152" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GTA VI Countdown</a>), Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the developers at Rockstar Games are trying to deliver something unexpected with GTA VI, even if that takes time.</p><p>"Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about. You thought you were anticipating this thing but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said he understands that fans have become "a little frustrated" as Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">works in secrecy on GTA VI.</a> But he said Take-Two's philosophy is to "wait for a title to be ready" before releasing it.</p><p>"I think [GTA VI] will be extraordinary and worth waiting for," he said, adding that he expects GTA VI to be "breathtaking."</p><p>Of course, part of Zelnick's job is to hype his company's products and use all kinds of marketing speak and buzzwords to get people excited, so hearing him say all of this is no surprise.</p><p>Another noteworthy tidbit from the interview is that Zelnick said he is aware of the GTA VI memes about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA VI."</a> He said, "I've seen some of those."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R09uNAeQNdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GTA VI is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">set for release in Fall 2025</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

Rival publishers are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reportedly waiting to assign dates to their own games</a> until Rockstar Games officially announces a release date for GTA VI.</p><p>In other news, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">recent report</a> said that with GTA VI, "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p>

                <p>Epic Games has had its share of legal victories over the years, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">one over Google earlier in 2024</a>. But when it comes to the federal government, the United States Justice Department just came down on Epic Games for violating Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which was put in place to keep members of the board of one company from being able to serve in the same capacity on a competitor's board.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice Department announced</a> that two members of Epic's board who were appointed by Tencent have voluntarily stepped down after the government raised the Clayton Act issue through its Antitrust Division. Tencent is a minority owner of Epic, and also the majority owner of Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. Epic has since confirmed that the two departing board members are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein. Additionally, Tencent has relinquished its right to appoint any additional members to Epic's board of directors.</p><p>"Our relationship with Epic has always centered on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers," said a Tencent spokesperson. "We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision."</p><p>Epic subsequently announced that Feder and Wallerstein will be replaced by "two new independent board members [who] will be nominated by committees of Epic's shareholders." Feder and Wallerstein will presumably retain their positions on Tencent's board.</p><p>Tencent is also a minority owner of Ubisoft, which is currently in negotiations with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-maintain-control-as-talks-with-tencent-continue-report/1100-6528283/" data-ref-id="1100-6528283">about a potential management buyout</a>. The Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--reportedly wants to maintain control of the company in any deal, while Ubisoft has been said to be in a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for any future investment in the company. For now, no deal between the two companies has been announced.</p><p>Earlier this week, Epic went to court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">to sue an alleged cheater</a>, whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments, which allowed him to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-calls-out-apple-for-arbitrary-rejection-of-its-new-app-store/1100-6524733/" data-ref-id="1100-6524733">Epic is still butting heads with Apple</a> over the former's desire to build an app store.</p>
