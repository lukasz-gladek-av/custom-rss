          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fortnite-remix-finale-event-featuring-juice-wrld/1100-6527953/" data-ref-id="1100-6527953">Fortnite Chapter 5 and Remix Finale event</a> takes the stage in-game on November 30, it will feature a pack of four iconic musical artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD. Like previous in-game concerts, such as those starring Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, the event is likely to be a kaleidoscopic audiovisual roller coaster. Still, by including the late Juice WRLD, who passed away in 2019, this in-game concert will also be decidedly different from any before seen in Fortnite: It will be the first to use an artist's likeness posthumously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-defends-use-of-a-i-in-new-movie/1100-6525952/">something that Hollywood is also grappling with as of late</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently spoke to Nate Nanzer, Epic's head of global partnerships, in a music-focused interview that hit on the developer-publisher's decision to bring Juice WRLD, whose real name is Jarad Anthony Higgins, to Fortnite. Nanzer told me Epic had long hoped to do something like this with the late artist and explained why the company feels now is the right time.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something that our players have been asking for for years and years and years, and we've wanted to do it, but we wanted to find the right moment," Nanzer said. "We obviously want to do it in the most respectful way possible. We worked very closely with his mom and his label, and we were able to find the right moment where it felt right, around this event, and he has new music coming out, so all the stars kind of aligned around this moment."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer mentioned that Juice WRLD himself was "a big Fortnite player," and though the Epic executive didn't say this, it stands to reason that Juice WRLD would want to be in the game if he could say so today. Still, even with the involvement of his family and his music label, for some, the inclusion of a deceased artist's likeness in this manner may always cross a line. In the movie world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-plans-to-sue-anyone-who-makes-an-ai-replica-of-him/1100-6527453/">Robert Downey Jr. recently said he plans to sue anyone who tries to create an AI replica of his likeness</a>, and that even if it were to occur after he has died, his "law firm will still be very active." Events in 2012 surely predate many of Fortnite's biggest fans, but the Juice WRLD concert also recalls the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbrFmPBV0Y">Tupac "hologram" that once performed at Coachella</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773" data-ratio="0.6015625" data-width="896" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773"></a><figcaption>Epic says players have begged for a Juice WRLD in-game concert, but when--if ever--is the right time for it?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the Fortnite world, I haven't personally seen a lot of pushback to Juice WRLD's involvement in next weekend's event. Certainly, there have been some feelings of ethics-based squeamishness, but the prevailing sentiment on places like the game's subreddit and popular Discord servers is one of excitement, perhaps owing to the often younger player pool in Fortnite. Whereas older players and onlookers may see this as a line being crossed, younger players who have already spent years growing up within Fortnite may more quickly accept this as a marvel of modern technology, and they may be excited to finally have the Fortnite Juice WRLD event Nanzer says has been one of the community's most requested.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our community loves his music. We have data [that shows he is] still extremely popular. And I would say, I can't quantify this, but when I look at Reddit threads, or Discord chats, or Twitter threads, Juice WRLD comes up over and over and over again. I mean, people have made Juice WRLD concerts in Fortnite Creative and [Unreal Engine for Fortnite]."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer added that he feels fans of the late artist will come out of the event with positive feelings. "We're hopeful. We know our players have been asking for it, so there's a lot of pressure to really deliver it the right way. I think people are really gonna love what we have coming, like, I think it's done in an awesome way. I think if you're a Juice WRLD fan, you're gonna feel good about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, Juice WRLD's mother, Carmela Wallace, was involved in this collaboration. Earlier this month, she shared remarks on the upcoming event, which you can read in full below.</p><p dir="ltr">"Jarad always loved to play Fortnite - it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others. From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does.‚Äù</p><p dir="ltr">The debate over when it is or isn't acceptable to use a deceased person's likeness won't end when Fortnite Chapter 5 does next weekend, but Nanzer told me the company wants "music to permeate everything in Fortnite," which likely means this isn't the last time Fortnite will court controversy, even unintentionally, as it strives to fulfill its vision of a multimedia metaverse. In fact, there are already rumors that a future Fortnite collaboration will revolve around XXXTentacion, a musical artist who was murdered in 2018 at the age of 20.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is a tastemaker on a global scale. Much of the games industry over the past half-decade has been mired in chasing lucrative trends that Fortnite started or had massive success with. Once meant to be nothing more than a survival game, Fortnite is today an increasingly hard-to-define platform that doesn't merely feature pop culture; it shapes it. As Epic continues down this path of making the ultimate <em>everything</em> experience, it's inevitably molding what the future looks like, whether we're ready to live there or not.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Editor's note: Remarks from Mrs. Wallace were added to the body of this story shortly after publishing.</em></p>

                <p>It's a perfect time for Iron Wolves to be thankful as Destiny 2's Iron Banner event will make its return next week. The Iron Banner usually brings along new weapons and ornaments, and this event will be no different as it introduces both a new armor set and rocket sidearm into the the loot pool. </p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-11-21-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny</a> announcements, the name of the armor set was revealed--Iron Intent--with pieces "worthy of Weyloran, Nirwen, and Orewig" themselves. Players will know those names as great Iron Lords, who've all had weapons and ornaments named after them throughout the years. The Iron Banner will return to the game starting on November 26, with the match type of Control for the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765"></a><figcaption>The new Iron Banner armor set, Iron Inent, for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg"></figure><p>The armor has a Norse-adjacent aesthetic with the Titan helmet almost looking like a hammer with the Warlock mask having studded horns. All three have intricate braiding embossing up and down the plates. Destiny has had similar ornaments before with the Valhund set, but still very different in presentation.</p><p>Along with the Iron Intent set, the announcement teased the first-ever Stasis rocket sidearm. It also revealed that it would be possible to get the weapon with the Loose Change perk with Chill Clip perks. As Iron Banner events are now two weeks long, there's plenty of time to get the perfect roll on the new weapon. The few rocket sidearms in the game have proven to be excellent, and the current Artifact has a lot of Stasis weapon-centric perks, so it should be a pretty desirable weapon. </p><p>The previous Iron Banner brought new versions of old favorites, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-claws-of-the-wolf-god-roll-guide/1100-6524666/" data-ref-id="1100-6524666">Claws of the Wolf</a> pulse rifle and Crimil's Dagger hand cannon. This will be the last time the banner is raised and Lord Saladin's sigil is lit during this episode, and if you missed out, it's a great time to make your enemies hear the howls and know fear.</p>
