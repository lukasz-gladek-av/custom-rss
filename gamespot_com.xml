                <p>With Nintendo announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/">Mario Kart World as an $80 launch game</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft also confirming</a> that its first-party titles will be sold at the same price, it looks like gaming is about to get a lot more expensive. Similarly to how base video game prices increased from $60 to $70 starting in 2020, other publishers will likely start to charge more for their products, but EA isn't currently planning to join this trend.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A session of its Q4 and FY2025 earnings conference call, EA was asked whether it would adopt a similar approach to other companies and adjust its "pricing power" for key IP in the future. "Our business is very different today than it was even just 10 years ago," EA CEO Andrew Wilson explained.</p><p>"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, well that's still a part of our business. It's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond. At the end of the day, whether weâ€™re doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p><p>"From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current strategy at this point," EA CFO Stuart Canfield added. It's worth noting that EA makes a <em>lot </em>of money from microtransactions. EA recorded $5.34 billion in this department in its 2025 financial year, and in comparison, video game sales brought in $2 billion in sales.</p><p>These comments come on the back of EA's publication of its fourth-quarter results for the three months ending on March 31, 2025. Wilson said that the company "significantly exceeded expectations" thanks primarily to games like EA Sports FC in Q4, The Sims, and Split Fiction. Live-service revenue also increased by 1% to $1.42 billion during this quarter, The Sims experienced the best growth in the history of the franchise, and total Split Fiction sales are nearly double what EA expected from the Hazelight Studios-developed game.</p><p>At the same time, it hasn't been smooth sailing at EA, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/">as hundreds of workers were laid off</a> and two "early-stage" incubation projects at Respawn Interactive were canceled.</p>

                <p>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has announced that it has reached an agreement with Plaion to acquire the publishing rights to the game. The company says that this deal will allow it to accelerate its content-development plans for Payday 3, and "pursue broader strategic opportunities" for the Payday franchise.</p><p>To secure the deal, Starbreeze issued $3.4 million in new shares--representing 10% of its outstanding share capital--with the bulk of the sales going toward repaying Plaion under its previous Payday 3 agreement and settling "certain outstanding" claims. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze has hinted</a> at new Payday projects in its announcement, as it'll continue to work with Plaion on "future Payday franchise" projects as part of its long-term strategy.</p><p>Following on the heels of the successful Payday 2, Payday 3 got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2023. The game was beset with various technical issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-sales-and-player-numbers-significantly-lower-than-hoped-for/1100-6521109/">low player numbers</a>, and a mandatory online-only requirement that proved to be very unpopular with the Payday community. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-ceo-is-gone-after-games-bad-start-and-low-player-numbers/1100-6521797/">Starbreeze's CEO Tobias Sjogren left the company in 2024</a> and the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">announced plans to improve the game</a> through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">various patches</a> as part of an effort titled Operation: Medic Bag.</p><p>Beyond Payday, Starbreeze is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-dragons-game-is-a-multiplayer-co-op-adventure-from-the-makers-of-payday/1100-6519684/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for all major platforms</a>. Not much is known about the game, but it is expected to be released in 2026.</p>

                <p>If you've ever played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, you'll be familiar with the creeping overwhelm that can happen when returning to the game after a while, or if it's your first time playing. There are a lot of menu options, quests, triumphs, challenges, and more all housed within a complicated UI that many people seem to struggle to navigate easily. I recently returned to the game after a three-month hiatus and found myself blindly clicking to find the menus I needed--and that's as someone with more than 3,000 hours in the game.</p><p>During a reveal stream for the new expansion, The Edge of Fate, Bungie also outlined many quality-of-life upgrades and updates coming to the game. The most notable of these is a complete overhaul to the game's UI, which is now known as the Portal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858"></a><figcaption>The new Portal in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png"></figure><p>The Portal is a streamlined activity-selection screen, instantly showing the activities available at that time. There are different subsections within the Portal depending on the type of activity you want to play. These are split into Fireteam, Pinnacle, Crucible, and Solo Ops sections. Solo Ops is a new category that splits off smaller, shorter, self-contained gameplay sessions for those who want to play without the need for a fireteam.</p><p>You can also tailor the activities on offer depending on the rewards you're seeking. There are 50 new gameplay modifiers, which allow for the most customization in Destiny 2 so far. Activity rotations are now curated to provide variety and something new.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859"></a><figcaption>The Portal splits subsections into clear activities</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png"></figure><p>From looking at the improved UI and the introduction of the Portal, it's already clear that Bungie may have fixed the most frustrating problem with its space shooter to date. As an avid Destiny 2 fan I've found myself trying to convince my friends to jump in, but with a complex New Light experience that dumps new players into the game with little direction other than suggesting to follow a marker for a bit to see what happens, they were reluctant, to say the least.</p><p>Now, with the Portal, the next logical activity is highlighted in the bottom right of the interface, whether that's a new campaign mission, or the next activity you need in order to complete a specific quest or triumph.</p><p>The Portal will be added with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, which also introduces new Destiny 2 armor systems, weapons, and locations. The first of those new locations, Kepler, will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">customizable difficulty</a> options, further deepening your ability to play the game exactly as you'd like.</p>
