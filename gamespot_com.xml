                <p>A new competitive mode called Seek and Deploy Extraction is coming to Halo Infinite this year, and to celebrate, Halo Studios has partnered with ForgeHub for a contest to build a multiplayer map for it. The event runs now through May 13 and features a $20,000 prize pool.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sneak-peek video on YouTube</a>--seen below--for S&amp;D Extraction that included info on the Halo Infinite map contest. The first-place winner will take home $5,000, with the runner-up receiving $4,000, per <a href="https://www.forgehub.com/events/contests/12631" rel="nofollow ">ForgeHub's website</a>. Additionally, only one 4-vs-4 arena can be created per person for this event, though people can collaborate in teams.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E3sCBLERWYs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's take on the tactical competitive mode--think Counter-Strike--will see squads of four rotating between offense (planting the bomb) and defense (stopping the bomb) each round. Winning six rounds first in S&amp;D Extraction will see your team come away victorious. The video notes that players won't have to "worry about carrying a bomb," as a designated area will prompt you to plant it. The starting weapon for Spartans is the Bandit Evo, though you can buy different weapons and equipment between rounds.</p><p dir="ltr">One mode that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-mode-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says/1100-6527192/">seemingly not coming to Halo Infinite is a battle-royale experience</a>. A developer who reportedly worked on the game's multiplayer mode claimed it had the chance to be "a game-changer for the franchise." Last month, however, did see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-doesnt-have-a-fuel-rod-cannon-but-will-have-a-rocket-that-fires-fuel-rods/1100-6529207/">the addition of a new power weapon that fired fuel rods</a> for the FPS.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">there are multiple Halo games in the works utilizing Unreal Engine 5</a>. There are no concrete details yet on any of these titles, though.</p>

                <p>Joe and Anthony Russo's new Netflix movie, The Electric State, is getting a tie-in game. The game is called The Electric State: Kid Cosmo, and it's a prequel to the movie.</p><p>Described as a "bite-sized adventure puzzle game," Kid Cosmo focuses on the movie's characters Michelle and Chris. The game is described as being a "narrative-driven game" and taking place over the course of five years. You can <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see footage of the game at Variety</a>.</p><p>Kid Cosmo launches on March 18 for iOS and Android--only Netflix subscribers can get it. As for the movie, the film debuts on Netflix on March 14.</p><p>The game hails from the Russo brothers' production company, AGBO, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-hemsworths-netflix-movie-extraction-might-become-a-game-under-agbos-new-deal-with-nexon/1100-6499357/" data-ref-id="1100-6499357">received $400 million in funding from gaming giant Nexon in 2022 to produce video games.</a> Anthony Russo told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game, which focuses on the characters Michelle and Chris, will provide more depth than what's possible in the movie alone.</p><p>"There's just a limit in a two-hour medium to how much ground you can cover, in terms of story. So the game does hold something very special in terms of like, who these people are, what their relationship is to one another, and how it evolves and grows over time," he said. "And I think people will find it very relatable. It's a wonderful, complicated brother-sister relationship in everything that that entails."</p><p>AGBO is likely to produce more video games in the future, as Anthony Russo said a "very important" aspect to the company's mission is to have its film and TV projects work "hand-in-hand with our gaming efforts." While Kid Cosmo is a mobile game, Anthony Russo said it's possible future games could land on other platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0g_7kEqKdU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y0g_7kEqKdU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Every idea has a different way that it can best be explored and best be brought to audiences or gamers for an experience," he said when asked if future games could be AAA console or PC games. "So we really like to tailor everything to the creative idea that weâ€™re exploring, evolving and building upon, in terms of how we find an expression for it."</p><p>AGBO <a href="https://www.agbo.com/about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently hired longtime Fortnite boss Donald Mustard</a> to help lead its gaming efforts, and Joe Russo said Mustard is now working on "building out what we think the future of storytelling could be." He said this could take the form of "some hybrid between linear and virtual and gaming."</p><p>"The three of us together are trying to explore and ideate around what opportunities there could be over the next decade using new tools and new technology to tell stories and can we make it can we make it true transmedia, where the same assets that we're using for CG in movies is also the same assets that are in the game, that are also the same assets in a virtual experience," Joe Russo said.</p><p>Netflix is involved in gaming, too, though the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">still trying to find its footing in the space</a>. As part this process, Netflix has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">closed a AAA gaming studio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-wont-release-these-six-previously-planned-games/1100-6529261/" data-ref-id="1100-6529261">canceled plans to release multiple games.</a></p><p>The Russo brothers are also making multiple more Marvel movies, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-mcu-sdcc-rdj-doctor-doom-russos-deadpool-wolverine-avengers-doomsday-secret-wars/1100-6525402/" data-ref-id="1100-6525402">Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. </a></p>

                <p>Rockstar Games made a big announcement today--but it seemingly has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. The company announced that it has acquired the Sydney, Australia-based game developer Video Games Deluxe, a studio with ties to LA Noire. Going forward, the studio will be re-named Rockstar Australia.</p><p>Video Games Deluxe had a long history of working with Rockstar prior to this acquisition, as the studio teamed up to help co-develop LA Noire and GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara previously established the Australian studio Team Bondi, which created LA Noire for Rockstar Games.</p><p>McNarmara said in a statement, "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."</p><p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p><p>As for Team Bondi, the Sydney-based studio named after the iconic beach, released LA Noire in 2011 with Rockstar Games as the publisher, and it was the company's one and only release. The game was a success by some measurements, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-at-odds-with-team-bondi-report/1100-6322180/" data-ref-id="1100-6322180">Rockstar and Team Bondi reportedly butted heads</a>. Team Bondi also faced allegations of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/igda-investigating-team-bondi-workers-rights-complaints/1100-6321475/" data-ref-id="1100-6321475">"absolutely unacceptable"</a> working conditions.</p><p>Happy Feet and Mad Max director George Mitchell's company, Kennedy Miller Mitchell, bought the rights to Team Bondi's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/whore-of-the-orient/">Whore of the Orient</a>. Warner Bros. was signed on as the publisher of the project, before backing out, leading to the game's cancellation.</p><p>Rockstar's global network of development studios are understood to collaborate on big games, so it's possible Rockstar Australia is also working on GTA 6. Nothing is confirmed, however, and Rockstar is known to be one of the more secretive gaming companies. Officially speaking, there is no word on what Rockstar Australia is working on.</p><p>Rockstar's new development studio in Australia joins the company's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big network of international studios</a>. These include:</p><ul><li>Rockstar Dundee</li><li>Rockstar India</li><li>Rockstar International</li><li>Rockstar LA</li><li>Rockstar Leeds</li><li>Rockstar Lincoln</li><li>Rockstar London</li><li>Rockstar New England</li><li>Rockstar New York</li><li>Rockstar North</li><li>Rockstar San Diego</li><li>Rockstar Toronto</li></ul><p>GTA 6 is set for release this year on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's projected to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and bring in more than $3 billion in revenue during its first year.</a> The game's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, Rockstar Games has not uttered a word about the game.</p>
