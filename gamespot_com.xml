                <p>The folks working on Balatro have let us know how to properly pronounce the game's title, even though there's no real "wrong" way to do so.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, publisher PlayStack's head of video marketing Naman Budhwar said, "'BAH-luh-trow' is how local folks say it, but it's kind of a 'gif' and 'jif' situation where [LocalThunk] doesn't really mind how people say it." Anyone can pronounce the word how they want, including variations like "Buh-LAH-trow" and "BAY-lah-trow."</p><p>Balatro recently go its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">fourth Friends of Jimbo pack</a>, which includes collaborations with Dead By Daylight and Assassin's Creed. Past Friends of Jimbo packs included crossovers with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, and Stardew Valley.</p><p>Last month, Balatro had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-confusing-rating-finally-changed-leads-to-europe-changing-how-it-rates-gambling-games/1100-6529673/" data-ref-id="1100-6529673">European classification changed from PEGI 18 to PEGI 12</a> due to an appeal from the game's regional publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing. PEGI concluded that even though Balatro taught poker hands, its more fantastical and mystical elements mitigated the gambling-gameplay aspects.</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.

                <p>Backyard Baseball pressed all the nostalgia buttons when it was revived last fall for PC as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-baseball/" data-ref-id="5000-4385">Backyard Baseball '97</a>, a pixel-for-pixel faithful remake of the original game--a challenging project given the revival team didn't have the game's original source code. As of today, March 27, it's available on platforms that didn't even exist when the game debuted: smartphones and tablets for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backyard-baseball-97/id6740349666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2qZH_9nmCyxb_gYycCVhW6c_EkcZ7D4nV6wUaS0rLtlduYRXJlQEKO9VrtjxDjgkG7qOl0nm5osbFrVa6FRG2OJlnHemcvfzxPRwVOwnQGD_6ZuKpxnbHczwY_sefEb6hkEsB3MF8urEEvhIXgEf5uJtAkaJepkZ5khP36cvCJ-888oPviaCc0RxJYIuNjd08NMgMOBK9-o392kjvEQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Android</a>.</p><p>Backyard Baseball '97 brings the same experience you might know from PC to smartphones and tablets, featuring touch controls and a few on-screen buttons that replace things like the ESC key that pauses the game on PC. Beyond those minor differences, this is the same experience PC players have access to. Like on PC, it also works with compatible controllers for those who may prefer that method. It's listed at $5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>The Backyard Sports series debuted with 1997's Backyard Baseball. In subsequent installments, the games tackled a variety of sports like football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and even skateboarding. Reboots of the series have occurred several times since then, first in the PS2 era with 3D takes on the formerly 2D series, and then again a few years later with a pair of Xbox 360 exclusives. A new game in the series hasn't been seen since 2015's pair of mobile-only sequels that were later removed from mobile stores.</p><p>Though Backyard Baseball '97 (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-soccer/" data-ref-id="5000-6785">Backyard Soccer '98</a>) doesn't feature real-life pro athletes, some later games did when they originally debuted, and Playground Productions has indicated at least some of these players will be returning to future revivals as they release.</p>
