                <p>Lost Soul Aside looks like it's going to deliver some high-octane hacking and/or slashing when it launches this year on May 30, and the game got its time in the spotlight during the February PlayStation State of Play event.</p><p>The fast-paced trailer gave looks at the monsters invading the world, impressive traversal mechanics, and even giant Kaiju fights. The world is being invaded by monsters, which you will need to hack through, and--in some instances, as shown in the trailers--take down in intense one-on-one fights. Lost Soul Aside is blending sci-fi and fantasy, which the trailer shows off with a large variety of environments, from liminal dreamscapes to modern cities and even ancient ruins. The traversal shown uses some kind of nano bots to create platforms and wings.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EKvNt4bijE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0EKvNt4bijE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-may-30/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the game will feature a large variety of weapons to use in its lightning-fast combat and will use the DualSense Haptic Triggers to add more feeling to every sword swing. The blog teases both close-range combat choices like swords, in addition to ranged bow options.</p><p>Developed by the Shanghai-based Ultizero Games, Lost Soul Aside was first announced back in 2022 and looks to blend fantasy and science-fiction elements with intense combat. We'll see if the studio has succeeded when it releases on PS5 and PC on May 30.

                <p>A new trailer for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds debuted during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">February Sony State of Play</a>. The fast-moving trailer showed off Sonic and his animal pals racing through a variety of recognizable Sonic locales, like Metal Harbor and Chao Park. And you may not have to wait long to feel the need for speed, as the trailer ended by announcing a closed network test coming on February 21.</p><p>The trailer showed more detail for the karts belonging to Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Shadow, and more. It also spent some time showing Sonic stunting while riding around on his kart and on a jet-board. It made a point to show the racers passing through rings that acted as portals, giving significance to the "CrossWorlds" name. It seems as if a typical race might actually cross through several iconic Sonic locations, as well as others like an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch this year.</p>
