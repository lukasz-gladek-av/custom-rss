                <p>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has commented on what impact, if any, there might be on the video game industry due to growing concerns about the global economy due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's latest investor briefing</a>, Wilson said he's personally witnessed many "twists and turns in the macro environment" in his 25 years with EA. In that time, he's learned that EA and its core franchises have remained "incredibly resilient through macro-challenging times."</p><p>The reason for this, Wilson said, is that he believes "entertainment is a fundamental human need."</p><p>"At this point in time, our form of entertainment is the first form of entertainment for much of the global population, and that grows every year as our industry continues to grow, and we represent incredible value," he said.</p><p>Wilson went on to say video games, despite growing costs, represent "incredible value" relative to other things that people can spend money on.</p><p>"While we are always prudent and pragmatic and thoughtful as we navigate macro uncertainty, we do believe that if we continue to deliver incredible entertainment experiences, we continue to invest behind our biggest franchises that remember, aren't just about entertainment, but are also about connection," he said. "This is where people spend their best time with their best friends where they connect with them every day to enjoy their best moments of the day that even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macroeconomic downtime, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p><p>Wilson also pushed back against the idea that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">EA might raise game prices to $80</a>, following Nintendo and Xbox. He said the business today is very different from what it was a decade ago when core revenue streams came from selling discs on shelves. That's still part of EA's business, but it's significantly smaller. Today, EA has multiple other revenue streams, including microtransaction-based free-to-play games and more expensive deluxe editions for games that help offset growing production costs.</p><p>"Our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow," he said.</p><p>To be sure, EA is making much more money these days from microtransactions and live-service elements than full-game sales. <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the past three months</a>, EA made $437 million form full-game sales and $1.458 billion from live service. For the full fiscal year, EA made $2 billion from full-game sales and $5.461 billion from live service.</p><p>Not everyone would agree that EA is getting the "quality-to-value" equation correct, though, as EA's games--and its sports titles in particular--are often criticized for their ubiquitous microtransactions. EA also just recently released the first paid season pass, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-introduces-a-paid-season-pass-and-some-fans-are-upset/1100-6531089/" data-ref-id="1100-6531089">people quickly voiced their concerns about it.</a></p><p>EA has a number of big games in development, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6.</a> With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 now delayed to 2026</a>, some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might release the game this fall</a>, but nothing is confirmed yet. The game will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">revealed properly at some point this summer</a>.</p>

Version 0.3.5 introduces a purchasable jukebox as well as the new storage unit property. If you're hyper efficient like me, making as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-mixing-and-recipes-guide/1100-6530964/" data-ref-id="1100-6530964">Schedule 1 recipes</a> as quickly as possible, you'll have encountered a lack of storage multiple times in your playthrough. You can only squeeze a finite number of shelves into your normal property, after all.</p><p>The storage unit property will be located at the north end of the overpass next to the casino, and costs $5,000 to purchase from Ray's Realty. This makes it an easy get for anyone in the early few hours of the game, since it's one of the cheapest properties to own.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490721"></a><figcaption>Buy the Schedule 1 storage unit from Ray's Realty</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490721-schedule-1-patch-notes.png"></figure><p>The storage unit, called Stash and Dash, allows for one worker and one loading bay, meaning you can have important ingredients or materials delivered to it. It's a limited space, but in the early game it's got plenty of room for several grow setups, and more shelves--perfect to stash all of your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-money-in-schedule-1-fastest-methods/1100-6531067/" data-ref-id="1100-6531067">Schedule 1 money</a> on, if you so desire.</p><p>Another addition is the jukebox, which you can buy for $1,500 from Bleuball's Boutique. Handily, this is right next to Ray's Realty, so you can buy both of the new features without the need for a trek across town. The jukebox adds the 19 tracks from the soundtrack, as well as eight brand-new tracks, all composed by Kaesul.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490722"></a><figcaption>The jukebox plays a total of 27 tracks by Kaesul</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490722-schedule-1-patch-notes%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>In addition, developer Tyler comments in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546734009405669632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> that he's fixed some bugs around loading docks not showing at the barn or the docks warehouse, and a random $100 online balance appearing during a fresh save. Individual save files have been consolidated into larger save files to reduce the amount of time it takes to save, and to work better alongside Steam Cloud Sync.</p><p>The next steps for Schedule 1 include replacing employee beds with lockers to save space, adding filters to item slots so that you can decide which items belong in which slots, and the ability to transfer employees between properties--something we've been longing for since hiring our first botanist.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_3e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">appointed</a> Japanese designer Kazuhiko Hachiya to its board of directors. You might not know him by name, but Hachiya is known for his ambitious products, like a flying machine inspired by the works of Miyazaki and his own take on a real version of the hoverboard from the movie Back to the Future.</p><p>Hachiya created the <a href="https://www.petworks.co.jp/user_contents/hachiya/works/OpenSky_Q&amp;A.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"OpenSky" project</a> that led to the creation of a motor glider based on the <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%B6we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mowe plane </a>from the Miyazaki anime <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>. Hachiya succeeded in creating a glider version of the aircraft and a jet-powered version. Take a look at the plane for yourself in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-OPa7cTrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hN-OPa7cTrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Before building his Miyazaki-inspired plane, Hachiya made <a href="https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/exhibitions/2006/opensky-2-0-hachiya-kazuhiko/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wearable devices that would allow the wearers to see through each other's eyes</a>. He also made an "AirBoard," which was billed as a real-life version of the hoverboard from Back to the Future.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGPx4QNR2i4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qGPx4QNR2i4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Nintendo did not specifically cite any one reason for its pursuit of Hachiya to join Nintendo's board of directors, but clearly, the man has passion and ambition.</p><p>Prior to his work on experimental airplanes and hovercraft, Hachiya joined Spazio Institute for Advanced Thinking Inc. in 1989, before becoming a top boss at doll company PetWorks Co., a position he still holds today. In addition to being a director at PetWorks, Hachiya is currently a professor of fine arts at Tokyo University of the Arts and the Director of the Art Media Center at Tokyo University of the Arts.</p><p>Hachiya is also known for developing the email app <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/19970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PostPet</a>. This software attempts to make corporate emailing more fun by having a little creature--a dancing pink bear named Momo is one of them--who lives in your computer personally deliver emails.</p><p><span>Nintendo will vote on whether or not to confirm Hachiya's appointment to the board during the company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 27, 2025.</span></p><p>This will happen not long after Nintendo releases the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on June 5.

                <p>Players may have been disappointed when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6 was delayed</a> into next year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">the newly released second trailer</a> has gone a long ways towards raising the anticipation to another level. However, if fans were hoping that GTA 6 would arrive with a robust 60 frames per second then they may be disappointed to hear that the trailer was only 30fps.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> has shared an extensive breakdown of GTA 6's second trailer, and its analysis is that it was upscaled to 4K at 30fps. DF also suggested that it may not be possible to get GTA 6 to 60fps at launch without drastically reducing the ray-tracing touches that give the game its visual identity.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>

<p>The Digital Foundry team gushed over the trailer's reflective surfaces, particularly during an early scene with Jason in his car that features multiple moving reflections simultaneously. Even small touches like the condensation in Jason's beer bottles and the movement of the liquid inside were well-executed.</p><p>Although a Rockstar Games representative told GameSpot that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-trailer-2-looked-great-and-it-wasnt-all-cutscenes/1100-6531380/" data-ref-id="1100-6531380">the trailer included some gameplay</a>, Digital Foundry's experts are convinced it was all cutscenes. They also suggested that the sheer size of the game and the power needed to render it are beyond the capabilities of Nintendo's Switch 2 or even Steam Deck.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9zVIy_La7nk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm sorry. This is probably too big for Switch 2," said Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia. "Everyone's going to hate me in the comments for saying that, but like, we have to be really realistic. This is some of the best real-time rendering we've ever seen. I don't expect a Steam Deck to run this. I don't really expect a ROG Ally X to run this."</p><p>Mike Dailly, one of the designers for the original GTA, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-gta-designer-mike-dailly-praises-rockstar-delay-after-new-gta-6-trailer/1100-6531347/" data-ref-id="1100-6531347">was also very impressed by the new GTA 6 trailer</a>. Additionally, Dailly praised Rockstar for not rushing the game out in its current state.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC port of GTA 6</a> hasn't been announced yet, but it's likely to arrive at some point in the future.</p>
