                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> players can score 15 free loot boxes easily for a limited time, with some of them earnable by simply playing the game for 15 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 15 of Overwatch 2 is now live, and with it the return of loot boxes that can be earned for free via its battle pass and weekly challenges. For the launch of the season, Blizzard has sweetened the deal with some limited-time event challenges that reward even more loot boxes than will be normal. Plus, Discord is getting in on the loot box action as well, offering five of them as a reward for a new quest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For the Discord quest, all players will need to do is accept the quest via the app and then play Overwatch 2 for 15 minutes. After completing and claiming the quest, players can redeem the code via Battle.net to receive their five free loot boxes. Quests can be found and accepted in the Discord app via the Discover tab. Players will have until February 25 to accept and complete the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Overwatch 2 weekly event challenges, players will need to first complete five matches (with wins counting as two) and then 15 matches to earn another five loot boxes per challenge. Since wins count as two, these can be done in just a few matches if your team comes out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the Discord quest, and that's a total of 15 loot boxes for very little overall playtime. Players will have until February 25 to complete the in-game challenges, which also feature other rewards like the Rainy Day skin for Mercy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">Loot boxes work a little differently now</a> from when they first debuted in the original Overwatch. For starters, players can't buy them outright, though they are included as part of the game's free and paid battle pass. An item of Rare or better quality is guaranteed to drop from each box. After opening five boxes, players are guaranteed an Epic-quality item, with a guaranteed Legendary drop after opening 20 boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes isn't the only big change as part of Overwatch 2 Season 15, Honor and Glory. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">shakes up Overwatch 2's gameplay in a major way with the introduction of Perks</a>, mid-match upgrades that augment a hero's abilities or even give them entirely new ones. For the full rundown of all the new Perks for each hero, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-15-patch-notes-all-perks-detailed-loot-boxes-return/1100-6529561/" data-ref-id="1100-6529561">Overwatch 2 Season 15 patch notes</a> for more details.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Season 16 later this year will bring even more big changes, with Blizzard recently unveiling the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based, third-person Stadium mode </a>and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">new hero, the crossbow-wielding Freya</a>, coming as part of the game's next season.</p>

Achievement hunters have plenty of collectibles to chase down for these recorded memoirs.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these collectibles are easily found during your adventures, but some of them are well-hidden or tricky to complete. Here we'll guide you through each collectible category for Tape 1 of Lost Records: Bloom and Rage.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>Chapters can be replayed in Collectible mode to allow you to replay and collect without interfering with your story choices.

All of these collectibles can be found during this chapter, as well as later trips to the cabin, but they are all pretty easy to obtain.</p><p dir="ltr">You only need six to complete this category, but you'll find more than you need. The most obvious ones being the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The deer-shaped weather vane on the roof</li><li dir="ltr">The broken bridge at the cabin</li><li dir="ltr">The wooden outhouse</li><li dir="ltr">The windchimes in nearby tree</li><li dir="ltr">The firepit at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The towels hanging on the line at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The miner's gravesite on the trail behind the cabin</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Graffiti___10_collectibles_needed">Graffiti - 10 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603"></a><figcaption>Graffiti on dumpster</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Graffiti is by far the easiest of the collectible categories to complete. You can collect these through most scenes in the game where you explore with your camcorder, but you can complete this all during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">This chapter takes Swann to the parking lot of the Movie Palace. The area is covered in graffiti, including the following areas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The graffiti marks on the fence's Do Not Enter sign</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the green dumpster near the Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">There are six different graffiti opportunities on the park benches by Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the side of the white van</li><li dir="ltr">Spray paint on the right side of the Movie Palace</li><li dir="ltr">Even more graffiti can be found on the rooftop if you take the ladder on the right side</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604"></a><figcaption>Character spotlights</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really no trick to these spotlight collectibles. Simply record 10 moments for each character. This can all be done during the chapter titled <strong>The First Night</strong>, or you can collect moments more organically throughout the entirety of Tape 1. You can work on this anytime Swann is able to record while with the girls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605"></a><figcaption>Forgotten Playground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Forgotten Playground collectibles can be earned during the chapter called <strong>The First Night</strong>. If you miss any, they can also be collected in later scenes where you visit the park, such as during Kat's memoir.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few more collectibles than you need here, but here are the main ones you'll likely find:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The seesaw</li><li dir="ltr">The marbles on the ground</li><li dir="ltr">The giant rocketship</li><li dir="ltr">The jungle gym</li><li dir="ltr">The animal-shaped spring riders</li><li dir="ltr">Swing set</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606"></a><figcaption>Filming Dylan after confrontation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The bullies category can be started early on in the game, with the very first encounter with Dylan and Corey during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mild Spoilers: </strong>If you make the same apologetic and non confrontational dialogue choices as I did when dealing with Dylan and Corey, you'll need to <strong>replay this scene in Collectible mode</strong> to get more of these. You need to pick the taunting choices, where you taunt and film Dylan, and then agree to film Corey and his bike.</p><p dir="ltr">The final bully collectibles come from an opportunity to film Corey again later in the game. This comes after near the end of the chapter titled the <strong>Abyss</strong>. This is also optional and missable. Nora will prompt you to film Corey, but the choice is yours.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607"></a><figcaption>Velvet Cove water tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is another easy category. You're basically filming the same Velvet Cove water tower throughout various scenes in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the opportunities are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Film while standing in the Movie Palace parking lot</li><li dir="ltr">Film from Swann's bedroom window in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be filmed from the park in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be seen from the bar parking lot</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608"></a><figcaption>Mothgirl placement at the end of Riot Grrrl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Mothgirl Chronicles collectible category starts during the chapter called <strong>Packing Up</strong>. This is an unmissable part of the story that takes place in Swann's bedroom, and filming Mothgirl for the first time unlocks this collectible category.</p><p dir="ltr">The remaining five collectibles require you to find a special spot where you can place Mothgirl and film. There don't seem to be any extra locations, so you'll need to replay sections if you miss these.</p><p dir="ltr">These hidden locations are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Later, during<strong> Packing Up</strong>, there is a scene with the girls at the lake, and you can place Mothgirl on a nearby rock and film her</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Double Dare</strong>, go up into the attic. You'll want to <strong>do this before you light the fireplace</strong>. Place Mothgirl on the ledge of the open section of the attic. (This collectible appears to be glitched. It lets me place Mothgirl here, but the game marks this as a location I've already recorded even though it wasn't previously recorded or in the footage.)</li><li dir="ltr">In the chapter titled <strong>Kat</strong>, you'll film an interview with her. You'll have the option to explore around the park afterwards, so make sure you <strong>grab your collectibles before telling her you're done</strong>. There are two Mothgirl locations here. Place Mothgirl on both the swing and the slide for two more collectible opportunities</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong>, you'll break into the fenced-off area of the bar. Immediately look right and place Mothgirl in the lounge chair on the right</li><li dir="ltr">After turning on the power during Riot Grrrls, run back to Nora's band setup and place Mothgirl on one of the speakers</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609"></a><figcaption>Bunny car pictured with the moo box on top of it for optional trophy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Terrible Toys memoir category requires you to film weird toys you find while on your adventures. Not all of these are available at this time, as Don't Nod told GameSpot that one of them is only found in Tape 2, coming this April, but here are the five known locations so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called The First Night, you can find a collectible when helping Kat look for the keys. You'll see a <strong>troll doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another toy can be found during The First Night chapter. When looking for something to knock down the keys, you follow Autumn into a junkyard. Here you'll find a <strong>creepy doll</strong> to film at the campsite</li><li dir="ltr">The third one you'll encounter is during the chapter called Garage Band. Inside Nora's garage you'll find a weird <strong>bunny car</strong> to film</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Grab the item sitting on top of the bunny car and inspect it. Rotating the item until it moos like a cow will <strong>unlock the hidden MOO! trophy/achievement</strong> to "Make the moo box moo."</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The next is found during chapter - Lights, Camera, Action! Before you follow your friends across the tree bridge, turn right towards the lake to find another <strong>creepy doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">The next is a <strong>voodoo doll</strong> that can be found in various times and locations. The best times to look are either during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark or This Old House. Head up into the cabin's attic to find a voodoo doll. The doll can also be found later in the story on a trail leading away from the cabin, or in a small cave entrance. It can only be counted once, though</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that since not all Terrible Toys can be found yet, it may also be the case that some other collectible categories can be finished in Tape 2, likely making those easier to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610"></a><figcaption>Strangers at the bar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are seven collectibles needed for the Strangers memoir category. The entire category is really easy to miss, depending on how you approach specific moments in the game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The first four can be discovered during the chapter called <strong>The Day We Met</strong>. Before interacting with any characters, use the ladder on the right side of the Movie Palace. You can climb up and get a view of two sets of characters. Corey and Dylan are at the back, and Nora and Autumn are at the Yooper Scooper ice cream shack.

This first-person horror game, which follows the final days of a shipwrecked space freighter crew, goes to some truly unsettling places. While Mouthwashing is only a few hours long, the chilling experience has really stuck with players, leading to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical acclaim</a> from critics and fans alike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGE8yrta8do" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tGE8yrta8do" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wrong Organ and Critical Reflex have confirmed that Mouthwashing has sold 500,000 copies since its release, an impressive feat for an indie game that flew under the radar prior to its release last September. Now that the game is a proven success, the developers are bringing Mouthwashing to consoles and even giving it a physical release.</p><p>While a specific date has not been shared yet, Mouthwashing will become available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S before the end of 2025. Physical editions of Mouthwashing PS5 and Nintendo Switch are also in the works, with preorders via Fangamer going live soon.</p><p>If you don't want to wait for Mouthwashing to come to consoles before playing it, you can buy it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$13 right now on Steam</a>.</p>

And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers and modders has blurred over the years, and there are definitely talented fans who can probably work wonders, even with an 18-year-old game engine. In 2021, a group of modders took it upon themselves to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-modders-are-recreating-a-version-with-better-graphics-in-source-2/1100-6495075/" data-ref-id="1100-6495075">recreate Team Fortress 2 in Valve's Source 2 game engine</a>. It should be interesting to see if modders can push the Team Fortress 2 code into something that goes far beyond the scope of the original game.</p><p>Last year, players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">review-bombed Team Fortress 2</a> over the game's ongoing issues with bots, which have been a problem for a few years. Regardless, Valve has continued to offer some additional content for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">including new maps</a>, well after most publishers would have declared the title to be finished.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic is reportedly in discussions to sell its games division to Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely Inc for roughly $3.5 billion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">Scopely was acquired</a> by Saudi Arabia owned Savvy Games in 2023 for $4.9 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit?srnd=undefined" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, the deal could be announced in the coming weeks, although an agreement has not yet been made, so the deal could fall through. The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go. The company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-wizards-unite-is-shutting-down/1100-6497637/">Harry Potter mobile game</a> shut down in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">Niantic laid off 230 people in 2023</a> after canceling a Marvel project and shutting down NBA All-World.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in games in recent years. In 2022, it was reported that the country was looking to invest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-looking-to-invest-almost-38-billion-in-games-industry-could-acquire-a-publisher/1100-6507917/">$38 billion into video game companies</a> and it has made significant investments in companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/">Nintendo</a>. The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>. Recently, the company announced a partnership between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/" data-ref-id="1100-6529448">Major League Baseball and Pokemon Go</a> to place themed PokeStops in stadiums, in addition to some clubs hosting Pokemon Go nights during the baseball season.</p>
