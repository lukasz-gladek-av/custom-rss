                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 launched July 1, and it hasn't taken long for players to discover an infinite-damage bug for the Sorcerer class that is trivializing the ARPG's hardest content. Even worse, it's not hard to replicate.</p><p dir="ltr">As broken down by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mekuna</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/infinite-damage-strikes-again-as-diablo-4-players-overthrow-the-tyranny-of-mathematics-with-an-exploit-that-grants-sorcerers-the-power-of-the-gods-no-way-that-they-leave-that-in-the-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), the bug revolves around the Sorcerer's Enlightenment Key Passive, which can be activated by casting skills of a different element to generate Enlightenment stacks. At 100 stacks, the Sorcerer becomes Enlightened and benefits from increased damage, mana regeneration, and attack speed for a limited time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c6FLFrumkg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's simple enough, but the passive is currently interacting with a new seasonal power, Smoldering Embers, that for some reason causes the damage bonus from Enlightenment to go through the roof when entering portals to a new area. By proccing Enlightenment right before going to a portal, the Sorcerer's elemental damage multipliers start to go up exponentially, with Mekuna's video showing how at one point, after going through several portals using the bug, his Sorcerer had plus 581,000,000,000% more Lightning damage.</p><p dir="ltr">With such absurd numbers, any enemy in Diablo 4 becomes child's play. Pit 150, the current hardest challenge in Diablo 4, can be cleared in under a minute, as everything instantly melts around a Sorcerer taking advantage of the bug.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hopefully that's going to be fixed quickly," Mekuna said in his video explaining the bugged build. "We don't need that in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days ago, players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6SW_yOZIg&amp;t=217s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> another bugged Sorcerer build that also took advantage of the interaction between Enlightenment and Smoldering Embers. That build, however, was much more difficult to replicate, as it required cycling Enlightenment with another modifier that, while possible, required far more precision.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of the bugged build doesn't require any careful stacking of modifiers and is so easy that basically anyone can do it. For that reason it's almost certainly now on Blizzard's radar, but there hasn't been any official word on when a fix might be coming, though one would hope it's soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to run until September 23. In addition to letting players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, Season 9 brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to the game's Nightmare dungeons</a>. It didn't, however, address the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">unpopular new Reliquary battle pass system</a>.</p>

Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus are reprising their roles as Rick and Daryl for voiceovers in the game. Danai Gurira--who starred as Michonne in The Walking Dead--wasn't mentioned by name in the announcement.</p><p>Inside the game, Rick will have three specific perks including the ability to lure the killer away away after unhooking survivors who were captured. Michonne's perks include the ability to temporarily heal herself after healing other survivors.</p><p>In addition to the Daryl Dixon legendary outfit, there will be multiple options for Rick and Michonne. Both characters will have uncommon recolors, while players using Rick can choose between his Last Day on Earth outfit or his Brutal Awakening outfit. Michonne has her Next World outfit and What We Become outfit as well.</p><p>A handful of the show's famous settings--including the prison from seasons 3 and 4 and the locked hospital doors that say "Don't Open, Dead Inside"--will be recreated in a new map tile that will appear when either Rick or Michonne are added into the Garden of Joy map.</p><p>Dead by Daylight x The Walking Dead is currently playable in beta testing, with the full release to follow on July 29.</p>

Over on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sucker Punch Productions said it'll be the "best look yet" at the game with a deep dive into gameplay.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to watch the Ghost of Yotei State of Play</h2><p dir="ltr">To check out the Ghost of Yotei State of Play, you just need to head to PlayStation's official <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRiTEkU3Utg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qRiTEkU3Utg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei State of Play start time</h2><p dir="ltr">Those of you in the US will be able to tune into the Ghost of Yotei State of Play in the afternoon, but it'll be a bit of a late one for European viewers, and even later for those in Japan and Australia.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>July 10</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">5 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">10 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM CEST</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>July 11</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">6 AM JST</li><li dir="ltr">7 AM AEST</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">The broadcast is being led by Sucker Punch's creative directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox, and over the course of almost 20 minutes, there should be looks at new weapons, "new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan," some new special modes, story details about new protagonist Atsu's quest, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei is still a few months away, assuming no delays take place, currently slated for release October 2. Not much of the game has been shown off outside of its initial reveal trailer, so <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/">available details</a> are slim, but this gameplay showcase should fill in quite a few blanks.</p>
