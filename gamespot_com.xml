                <p dir="ltr">It's the season of giving, and Steam has a free gift up for grabs to keep you entertained over the holidays.</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 is a 2D arcade shooter set in--you guessed it--distant space, and is currently available for anyone to claim for free on Steam. A sequel to the original Space Distant, developer PixelMouse aptly describes the game as "an indirect continuation of the first part" that features "more dynamic gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 challenges players to pilot a spaceship through 26 levels of enemies, including three special boss ships, which PixelMouse says are especially challenging. On the bright side, players can find unique weapons by destroying and looting enemy ships, which will make those boss fights a little less daunting.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your task is to destroy enemy ships on each level to go to the next of 26 available [levels]," the game's Steam page reads. "In addition to conventional ships, you will have to wait for the boss ships, the battle with which will not be easy."</p><p>Distant Space 2 is currently available to play for free on Steam (download it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729460/Distant_Space_2/" rel="nofollow ">here</a>), but this no-strings-attached gift won't be around forever, so players will want to add this title to their library before the 100% discount expires on December 24 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. If you prefer to play its predecessor first, you can get your hands on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5251/Distant_Space_Pack/" rel="nofollow ">Space Distant and Distant Space 2</a> for only $0.73 USD.</p><p>For even more Steam-powered savings, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2024-game-deals/2900-6097/" data-ref-id="2900-6097">the best deals featured in this year's Steam Winter Sale</a>.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new game called <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Captain Laserhawk: The Game</a>, which is a top-down multiplayer shooter that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology. It's currently in early access on PC and somehow features Rayman.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the game is based on the Netflix show Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which itself is based on the Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon spin-off. In Captain Laserhawk: The Game, Rayman is simply the announcer for deathmatches, so he's not actually playable.</p><p>The game requires players to have a Niji Warrior NFT to play. A Rayman profile picture can also be purchased for 750 virtual coins and attached to your Niji Warrior NFT. That's pretty much the extent of Rayman's involvement in this game. Ubisoft has quietly released this game to little fanfare, as there aren't many social media posts even acknowledging its existence outside of a few <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium posts</a>.</p><p>NFTs were a hot topic a few years ago, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-and-ea-executives-are-big-believers-in-nfts/1100-6497712/" data-ref-id="1100-6497712">Electronic Arts, Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-there-will-be-10000-characters-in-its-nft-game/1100-6512348/" data-ref-id="1100-6512348">Square Enix</a> vouched for them. However, the sentiment has died down considerably as the industry pivoted into the next tech craze: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-with-ai/1100-6520074/" data-ref-id="1100-6520074">AI.</a></p><p>Ubisoft had an NFT platform called Quartz, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-backlash-over-nft-program/1100-6500076/" data-ref-id="1100-6500076">received backlash</a> when it was first announced. Ubisoft also experimented with NFTs for Ghost Recon Breakpoint, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-support-has-ended/1100-6502187/" data-ref-id="1100-6502187">ended support for the game</a> in 2022.</p>
