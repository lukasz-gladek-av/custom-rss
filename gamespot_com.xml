Essentially a user-friendly version of Blender, players are able to sculpt in 3D, producing incredible works of art--or pure nightmare fuel--that have been chiseled to perfection.</p><p>This is meant to be a creative diversion from DK's new adventure, and some of the creations that people have gleefully uploaded to their social media accounts are best described as creative or cursed--sometimes, both--and they're all <em>excellent</em>.</p><p>Some of the creations glimpsed below include Five Nights at Freddy's fanart, an unflattering portrait of US VP JD Vance, and a version of DK that can see into the very depths of your soul. All of them look like they could easily replace the Mona Lisa at The Louvre, and at the very least, they deserve their own wing at that art museum.</p><p>People are really making the most of this mode, as the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls offer a high level of precision. Accessing Artist Mode is also easy, as it's available from the main menu of Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza has earned critical acclaim since it launched this week, as it's not only one of the best games of the year, but a must-play Switch 2 title as well. Looking ahead, Nintendo will continue to expand the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2 library</a> with several highly anticipated games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> alongside dozens of third-party releases.</p>

So far, the puzzle title only supports English as players use emoji to finish phrases with short clues. For example, there is a mystery two-word phrase with "departure" as the clue (which can be expanded, though it costs a move). The solution requires dragging over the sunrise and clock emoji for "early," followed by car and keys emoji for "start." These emoji also have to be selected from a larger group, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492" data-ratio="1.02394106814" data-width="1086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492"></a><figcaption>The Emoji Game is now available as part of an Apple News+ subscription, joining other puzzle titles like Crossword Mini and Quartiles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Emoji Game is the perfect addition to the Apple News+ suite of word and number puzzles, turning the emoji we use every day into a brainteaser that's approachable and fun," said Apple News editor-in-chief Lauren Kern.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-spelling-game-comes-to-apple-news-plus-with-ios-17-5-update/1100-6523464/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/">debuted Quartiles on Apple News+</a>, a spelling game where players create words by combining two- to four-letter tiles.

                <p>Valve's ubiquitous PC gaming storefront, Steam, may soon experience a purging of its adult content after a significant change to its guidelines this week.</p><p>In a quiet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update to its terms</a>, Valve has now provided that, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult-only content" should not be published on Steam.</p><p>The move, which invites banks and similar institutions to exercise an unprecedented degree of power in the kind of content that goes up on Steam, seems to have been made to appease the payment processors that work with Valve. This tactic, while relatively new to games, has been used in the past to go after porn and sex work sites like OnlyFans.</p><p>This change to Steam's guidelines has already brought down several games from the store. In a response to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>, Valve claimed that it was already notified of certain games violating the new standards set in place by its payment processors, saying, "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam. We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future."</p><p>This shift in policy comes as multiple digital storefronts, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">Nintendo eShop</a> and Steam, begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking down</a> on a glut of content that's been dubbed "slop" of late. Many of these titles, which seem to blatantly infringe on the aesthetics and naming conventions of existing popular games and feature sexual (see: adult) content, have popped up in great number over the last several months. Many believe these games are largely made by developers capitalizing on generative AI and large-language models to quickly produce content masquerading as the games they're ripping off.</p><p>However, the language used in the update leaves many factors unclear and open to a potentially disastrous amount of interpretation. For example, it is never clarified what "kinds of adult-only content" will not be permissible on Steam now. Moreover, the updated guidelines stress that these payment processors are enforcing new rules that should be adhered, but never makes clear exactly what the new standards of these companies are.</p><p>Despite the fact that a lot of these "slop" games lead with sexual content, there are also plenty of developers making adult-only games that touch on similar subjects. Following these changes, there are now many developers at risk of being penalized or being removed from one of the largest digital gaming storefronts.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has made a major change to what you can buy on your Xbox or through the Windows web store. As of today, July 18, Microsoft is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/troubleshoot-movies-and-tv-on-xbox-one" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no longer</a> offering movies or TV shows to buy or rent.</p><p>Anything you previously bought can still be viewed through the Movies &amp; TV app, but Microsoft has removed the ability to purchase anything more.
