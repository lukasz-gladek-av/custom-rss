                <p>Insomniac Games is pressing ahead with its next games, but it will do so without longtime boss Ted Price, who is retiring in March.

But it's not time for that yet.</p><p>One of the new Insomniac bosses, Chad Dezern, told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the studio would "love to talk more about Wolverine," but it can't just yet. "We have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road," he said. "As much as we're as much as we have pent up excitement, we got to hold on to it. So that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."</p><p>Dezern also refused to confirm or deny if the new Wolverine game will release in 2025.</p><div tabindex="0"

ago.</p><p>Wolverine is Insomniac's only upcoming announced game, but the studio has at least one other game in the works. Price said in a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that Insomniac is in a strong position today, "with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic."</p><p>Given the immense success of Insomniac's Spider-Man games, it's expected that the studio would make another Spider-Man game, though this is not confirmed yet.</p><p>The new Wolverine game was announced back in 2021, but we still don't know much about it.

Activision has revealed the season's new gameplay trailer, which features new multiplayer maps, more DLC weapons, and operator skins. The trailer also gives a first look at gameplay and Wonder Weapons for the upcoming Zombies map.</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the post-launch content for Black Ops 6 has forgotten about the game's '90s setting, the Season 2 trailer includes a remixed version of Bush's 1996 hit "Machinehead." Season 2 is themed around ninja-esque operators who are dual-wielding katanas, as seen in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpnKJBhL48" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXpnKJBhL48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One of the multiplayer maps shows gameplay inside a car dealership, which is simply called Dealership. Another multiplayer map features a super-yacht that looks similar to the Hijacked map from Black Ops 2, but this is apparently a new yacht map called Lifeline. A third map is called Bounty, but we don't get to see much of the setting. These three maps will arrive at launch, while two additional maps will drop during the midseason.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies footage is also featured near the end of the trailer, giving the first look at gameplay on The Tomb map. It also reveals the map's unique Wonder Weapons, which are four staffs similar to the ones used on the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision shared the new <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1881754960213512314" rel="nofollow ">promotional art for Season 2</a>, which reveals the katanas, PPSh-41 submachine gun, and FAL rifle as the new weapons in the game.</p><p>Season 2 will bring several game improvements, including the ability to turn off cross-play in Ranked Play modes. Here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything rumored and announced for Season 2</a> so far.</p>
