As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-01/-dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-high-stakes-at-bioware" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, The Veilguard started as a single-player game, before being rebooted with a focus on multiplayer and live-service. After Gary McKay took over as BioWare GM, he began to question if that was the right choice, ultimately leading to the decision to reboot the game once again, going back to a single-player design.</p><p>"We were thinking, 'Does [multiplayer/live-service] make sense, does this play into our strengths, or is this going to be another challenge we have to face?'" he said. "No, we need to get back to what we're really great at."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1422371498" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

its original design as a single-player game.</p><p>"Once we made that decision, a lot of things started to fall into place," McKay said.</p><p>EA's live-service business is booming, as the company just this week reported <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Strong-Q2-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earning $1.3 billion from live services</a> over the past three months alone. But not every game from EA will be a multiplayer/live-service game. Before Dragon Age: The Veilguard, EA had success with the single-player-only Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-ea-confirms-it-will-continue-to-invest-in-the-series/1100-6494818/" data-ref-id="1100-6494818">sold more than 10 million copies.</a> Its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">Jedi Survivor, was among the best-selling games of 2023.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, it was revealed that BioWare's other major internal team, which was working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect</a>, was called in to help finish The Veilguard and get it out the door. EA's Motive Studio, which is making a new Iron Man game, was also recruited to help BioWare, the report said.</p><p>McKay said he hopes The Veilguard can help BioWare return to its former glory as a "top game studio" following the struggle that was Anthem.</p><p>It's early days, but there are some positive signs already. For one, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Veilguard is getting generally positive review scores</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-biowares-biggest-launch-ever-on-steam/1100-6527529/" data-ref-id="1100-6527529">the RPG is also setting records on Steam.</a></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review in progress</a> scored the game a 7/10.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> is no longer supported on Steam Deck or Linux as a result of cheating, according to EA.</p><p dir="ltr">"Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck," an EA community manager wrote in <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" rel="nofollow ">a post announcing the change</a>. "There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux)."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" rel="nofollow ">introduced Steam Deck support</a> in March 2022, making it one of the only battle royales available to Steam Deck users. The same year, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said that there were no current plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> accessible on Steam Deck, citing <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490565925648715781" rel="nofollow ">the very same anti-cheat concerns</a> EA is now raising regarding Apex.</p><p dir="ltr">"The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers," EA's post continues. "Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention."</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, EA "had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex." The Apex Legends publisher says that although the number of players using Linus isn't particularly large, "their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games."</p><p dir="ltr">EA recently announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-sequel-isnt-in-the-cards-respawn-focused-on-improving-the-game/1100-6527511/">working to future-proof the game</a> in the hopes of ensuring Apex Legends remains playable for "10 to 15 years," and developer Respawn Entertainment has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-victories-against-cheaters-and-bots-detailed-in-first-of-many-blog-posts/1100-6526001/">increased anti-cheat improvement efforts</a> in recent months. The sudden move to revoke Linux support is likely a part of EA's efforts to stabilize the game ahead of Season 23's launch.</p><p dir="ltr">But there is one option for Apex players who don't want to abandon their Steam Decks: installing Windows.</p><p dir="ltr">"Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows," EA's post noted.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Flashbang grenades are meant to disorient your foes. Instead, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players have discovered that using them to blind your teammates will net you 15 XP. It's a farming trick that promotes bad cooperation.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Expel posted a video of the XP exploit <a href="https://x.com/iamExpel/status/1851710616320295358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851710616320295358%7Ctwgr%5Ef633b41a8d558e587331c79028b5f75ddab84bb1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fcall-of-duty-black-ops-6s-hottest-new-xp-farming-trick-has-players-flashbanging-their-allies-for-a-measly-15xp%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>, adding that throwing flashbang grenades at allies "gives you XP" and "do with this information what you will." The UI text on screen states, "Flashed Enemy," so it seems likely this is an unintended benefit for being a terrible teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/" data-ref-id="1100-6527292">progression and prestige is a core tenet of Black Ops 6</a>, on top of the rewards and unlockables in multiplayer. As such, there will always be players looking for easy ways to level up. For instance, the original Destiny famously had a loot cave for farming a decade ago, when people mindlessly shot at a cavern for hours on end. That exploit was addressed but ended up leading to an in-game dungeon acknowledging the loot cave. </p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launched a week ago and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">saw a record-setting debut</a>. The new entry in the FPS franchise had the "biggest" three-day opening weekend for Call of Duty in regard to total players, hours played, and total matches. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-spiked-call-of-duty-to-a-bonkers-day-on-xbox/1100-6527515/" data-ref-id="1100-6527515">debut of Black Ops 6 also led to a "bonkers" day of engagement for Call of Duty HQ</a>--the app housing the game along with Warzone and Modern Warfare 3. Over half of all Xbox Series X|S owners checked out Call of Duty HQ on October 28, while over a third of all PS5 owners did the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">iconic Nuketown multiplayer map arrives in Black Ops 6</a>. This is the original arena from Black Ops set in the 1950s, instead of a new variation. Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Black Ops 6 Season 1 has been confirmed to begin November 14</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer review</a>.</p>
