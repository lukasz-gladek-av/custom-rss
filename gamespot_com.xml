                <p>Later this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will take players to a distant colony world called Arcadi, where they can shoot their way out of trouble with a new assortment of weapons. According to the game's director, Brandon Adler, Obsidian Entertainment knew the sequel needed to be a significant improvement over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-review-over-the-moon/1900-6417345/" data-ref-id="1900-6417345">The Outer Worlds</a>. To achieve that goal, the team turned to the developers of Halo for advice.</p><p>"We ... talked to the Halo folks," Adler tells <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/25/the-outer-worlds-2-the-most-expensive-xbox-game-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. "They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, 'You guys should target this… you should add that to your weapon configurations.'" Adler also says that Obsidian "did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that [gunplay] felt.'"</p><p>Adler notes that the sequel doesn't have loading screens before entering buildings like its predecessor, and the weapons have been revamped with fresh options and customizable features.</p><p>"We didn't want small changes," continues Adler. "Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose. You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things."</p><p>One of the other changes in the sequel is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-lets-players-choose-between-first-and-third-person/1100-6532273/" data-ref-id="1100-6532273">players can swap from first-person to third-person at will</a>, and decide how they want to experience the game. The Outer Worlds 2 also has the distinction of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-releases-in-october/1100-6532242/" data-ref-id="1100-6532242">the first $80 game for Xbox Series X|S</a>. In a previous interview, Adler said that Obsidian didn't set the price for the game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-director-reacts-to-80-price-says-take-it-up-with-microsoft/1100-6532390/" data-ref-id="1100-6532390">suggested that players should take it up with Microsoft</a> if they have a problem with it.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 29.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3677" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders" data-collection="" title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Outer Worlds 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$80 | Releases October 29</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 standard edition includes the base game on your platform of choice.

                <p>Late last year, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player named Sebastian Araujo alleging that he used cheating software on multiple occasions during tournament play that allowed him to beat players who followed the game's rules. Now, Epic has announced that the court has made a summary judgment in its favor, in part because Araujo never responded to the lawsuit.</p><p>Epic shared the news on social media and noted that the judgment was for $175,000. Additionally, Araujo has been banned from Fortnite for life. Epic also stated that it plans to donate any money it collects to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/site/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Child's Play</a>, a charity that provides sick children in hospitals with toys and games to keep their spirits raised and encourage healing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">THIS JUST IN: The Judge ruled in our favor after the cheater ignored our lawsuit. The player is required to pay $175,000 and we’ll donate what we collect to charity. They are also banned from playing Fortnite forever. <a href="https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4</a></p>  — Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This outcome shouldn't be too surprising, as Epic has aggressively gone after cheaters as well unscrupulous players who sell cheating programs. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/" data-ref-id="1100-6503270">Epic won a sizable amount from an Australian Fortnite cheat maker</a> and donated the settlement to Child's Play. Earlier this year, Epic took action against pro Fortnite player Morgan Bamford aka RepulseGod and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-shows-why-cheaters-never-prosper-after-epic-successfully-sues-pro-player/1100-6529540/" data-ref-id="1100-6529540">banned them from ever taking part in the game's organized tournaments again</a>. Bamford subsequently apologized and returned the prize money to Epic, which once again donated the total to Child's Play.</p><p>Cheaters aren't the only ones who have to fear Epic's legal reprisals. The publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-qa-tester-who-leaked-battle-roy/1100-6460042/" data-ref-id="1100-6460042">sued a game tester in 2018</a> for leaking Battle Royale Season 4 details. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-streamers-for-advertising-cheat/1100-6462540/" data-ref-id="1100-6462540">streamers who touted Fortnite cheats on their live-streams</a> haven't been immune from Epic's wrath. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371"> Epic took a cheat maker and several associates</a> who distributed the software to court in a new lawsuit. The outcome of that case is yet to be decided.</p>
