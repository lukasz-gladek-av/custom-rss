                <p>Epic Games has yet to officially confirm that the next major Fortnite update will focus on The Simpsons, but the evidence continues to grow. Today, it was reported that <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Szyslak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Moe Szyslak</a>, the slimy bartended from Moe's Tavern, will have a skin in the forthcoming Simpsons collaboration.</p><p>He would join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">Ned Flanders</a>, who was previously leaked, along with presumably some or all of the main Simpson family members like Homer and Marge.</p><p>Moe is one of the best-known and most-recognizable characters from The Simpsons, so him being included with the rumored collab is not a big surprise. The leak, from user Blortzen, said Moe will have a skin in Fortnite and will appear on the map as an NPC. Moe's Tavern will be on the map, too, it seems.</p><p>The rumored upcoming Fortnite collaboration with The Simpsons is said to be significant, with Fortnite adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">new map based on Springfield</a> and featuring its various points of interest, like the nuclear power plant where Homer works.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">everything we've heard so far about the rumored Simpsons collaboration with Fortnite.</a> The new season is rumored to begin in early November.</p><p>In semi-related news, a fan-made re-skin of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run focusing on Futurama has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simpsons-hit-run-designer-loves-fan-made-futurama-re-skin/1100-6535602/" data-ref-id="1100-6535602">drawn the praise of one of the game's original designers</a>.</p><p>As for the TV series, The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and is now in its 37th season. The show was renewed earlier this year and will continue through at least Season 40 in 2028-2029. A second Simpsons Movie is coming as well, and it's set for release in July 2027, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">on the same day as A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>
