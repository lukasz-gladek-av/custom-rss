                <p dir="ltr">It's the season of giving, and Steam has a free gift up for grabs to keep you entertained over the holidays.</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 is a 2D arcade shooter set in--you guessed it--distant space, and is currently available for anyone to claim for free on Steam. A sequel to the original Space Distant, developer PixelMouse aptly describes the game as "an indirect continuation of the first part" that features "more dynamic gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 challenges players to pilot a spaceship through 26 levels of enemies, including three special boss ships, which PixelMouse says are especially challenging. On the bright side, players can find unique weapons by destroying and looting enemy ships, which will make those boss fights a little less daunting.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your task is to destroy enemy ships on each level to go to the next of 26 available [levels]," the game's Steam page reads. "In addition to conventional ships, you will have to wait for the boss ships, the battle with which will not be easy."</p><p>Distant Space 2 is currently available to play for free on Steam (download it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729460/Distant_Space_2/" rel="nofollow ">here</a>), but this no-strings-attached gift won't be around forever, so players will want to add this title to their library before the 100% discount expires on December 24 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. If you prefer to play its predecessor first, you can get your hands on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5251/Distant_Space_Pack/" rel="nofollow ">Space Distant and Distant Space 2</a> for only $0.73 USD.</p><p>For even more Steam-powered savings, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2024-game-deals/2900-6097/" data-ref-id="2900-6097">the best deals featured in this year's Steam Winter Sale</a>.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new game called <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Captain Laserhawk: The Game</a>, which is a top-down multiplayer shooter that utilizes NFTs and blockchain technology. It's currently in early access on PC and somehow features Rayman.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, the game is based on the Netflix show Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which itself is based on the Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon spin-off. In Captain Laserhawk: The Game, Rayman is simply the announcer for deathmatches, so he's not actually playable.</p><p>The game requires players to have a Niji Warrior NFT to play. A Rayman profile picture can also be purchased for 750 virtual coins and attached to your Niji Warrior NFT. That's pretty much the extent of Rayman's involvement in this game. Ubisoft has quietly released this game to little fanfare, as there aren't many social media posts even acknowledging its existence outside of a few <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium posts</a>.</p><p>NFTs were a hot topic a few years ago, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-and-ea-executives-are-big-believers-in-nfts/1100-6497712/" data-ref-id="1100-6497712">Electronic Arts, Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-there-will-be-10000-characters-in-its-nft-game/1100-6512348/" data-ref-id="1100-6512348">Square Enix</a> vouched for them. However, the sentiment has died down considerably as the industry pivoted into the next tech craze: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-with-ai/1100-6520074/" data-ref-id="1100-6520074">AI.</a></p><p>Ubisoft had an NFT platform called Quartz, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-backlash-over-nft-program/1100-6500076/" data-ref-id="1100-6500076">received backlash</a> when it was first announced. Ubisoft also experimented with NFTs for Ghost Recon Breakpoint, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-recon-breakpoint-support-has-ended/1100-6502187/" data-ref-id="1100-6502187">ended support for the game</a> in 2022.</p>

                <p>Very few basketball players are good enough to make it in the NBA, and that alone places Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Donovan Mitchell in rare territory. Unfortunately for Mitchell, his skills on the battlefields of Call of Duty don't seem to be the equal of his skills on the basketball court. During a recent press appearance, Mitchell acknowledged his struggles with the game and how it gave him a raspy voice.</p><p>"I've been playing Call of Duty with these kids, screaming at them and stuff, that's where the voice goes," <a href="https://youtu.be/fNViNFuuY8M?t=202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said Mitchell</a>.

He suggested that this may have happened because he plays basketball for a living before saying that he's asked for a reprieve from his Call of Duty purgatory. </p><p>"I reached out to Call of Duty," said Mitchell.

                <p>It's been more than one year since Rockstar Games released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, and in fact, the wait for the next trailer has now broken a record for the developer.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/GTA6Plus/status/1869787951036805356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As GTA 6+ first noticed</a>, the time between Trailer 1 and the inevitable Trailer 2 for GTA VI has now eclipsed the wait times for the first and second trailers for Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption II.</p><p>GTA V got its first trailer on November 2, 2011, with its second trailer arriving on November 14, 2012 for a total of 378 days between. Red Dead Redemption II's first trailer arrived on October 20, 2016 and its second arrived on September 28, 2017--that was a gap of 343 days.

Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase revealed during a press conference this week that he doesn't want to appear on the game's cover, seemingly aware of the Madden curse.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/Trags/status/1869846693451280690" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Bengals columnist Mike Petraglia shared a video clip of Chase where the star wide receiver discusses video games. While he does play Madden, Chase clearly doesn't want to be the game's cover athlete. When asked about the possibility, the NFL's wide receiver leader in catches, yards, and touchdowns replied: "No, I don't want that [knocks on wood]. No."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Trags/status/1869846693451280690" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Ja’Marr Chase was all fun and games talking old school video football games and Madden until the subject of a possible cover came up. “No!

However, the Bengals wide receiver was open to appearing on the cover of a NFL Street revival game. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS Sports</a> recently ran through the data of Madden cover stars for this century (2000-24), finding that 58% of the players were "cursed"--meaning they dealt with an injury or decline in performance. However, the report states that only 25% in the past decade have been "cursed."</p><p dir="ltr">This all comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-cover-athlete-christian-mccaffrey-injured-will-miss-4-games/1100-6526490/" data-ref-id="1100-6526490">Madden NFL 25 star Christian McCaffrey was injured</a> earlier this season.
