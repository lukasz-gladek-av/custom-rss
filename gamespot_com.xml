                <p dir="ltr">After several years of plundering Lost Sectors to kill pumpkin-headed bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players will have some new spooky activities to complete when this year's Festival of the Lost rolls around.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie mentioned a few changes coming to Destiny's yearly Halloween event during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">Renegades expansion</a>. Alongside the yearly drops of themed cosmetic armor and special weapons, developers mentioned both a new six-player PvE activity and a three-player PvP activity.</p><p dir="ltr">The six-player activity is called Haunted Altars, and according to Destiny design lead Clayton Kisko, it sees the Headless Ones--huge Halloween-themed boss monsters who sport pumpkins where their heads used to be--finally escaping from the Lost Sectors where they've been holed up for previous festivals. As for the PvP activity, it's called Red Rumble. Bungie didn't provide any details as to what the activities will actually be, but they should shake up the formula of raiding Lost Sectors, which has been the mainstay activity since back before the release of the Beyond Light expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">This year also sees the return of "hocus-focusing," which allows you to pick the loot you'll receive during the event. You'll need Eerie Engrams, which drop from Festival activities, and Candy, the currency you'll get throughout the Festival of the Lost period. Hocus-focusing allows you to receive specific weapons from the Festival loot pool, or to grab Exotic gear, as long as you have the Candy to pay for it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's Festival of the Lost armor for 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside a few new details about Destiny 2's Halloween celebration, Bungie also showed off this year's Festival of the Lost cosmetic armor ornaments, which are themed around pop-culture killers. Players voted between armor sets themed on Slashers and Specters back in January, but it seems as though Bungie combined elements of both groups into the final armor set.</p><p dir="ltr">Hunters can grab armor themed around the look of a ghostly bride (which also blends in some of the Ghost Face-esque look inspired by the slasher from the Scream movies); Titans get a look inspired by hockey mask-wearing murderer Jason Vorhees of Friday the 13th; and Warlocks can dress up as a creature akin to the internet's favorite tall spindly faceless child-stalker, the Slenderman.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, those armor ornaments will be available through the Eververse Store for Silver, Destiny 2's premium currency--so don't expect to earn them through gameplay.</p><p>Bungie ran down lots of details about Renegades during the livestream, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-power-grind-should-get-less-grindy-in-renegades-expansion/1100-6534592/">changes it's making to Destiny 2's loot and Power grind</a>, based on player feedback.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during its latest livestreamed reveal presentation, Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 and its four different models: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-17-officially-announced-with-four-new-versions/1100-6534588/">"impossibly thin" iPhone Air</a> has grabbed headlines, each member of this new generation of iPhone features a pair of new tech additions that mobile gaming enthusiasts will particularly find interesting.</p><p dir="ltr">First is the new Super Retina XDR display, which not only features the Ceramic Shield 2 for better protection, but will also support ProMotion up to a 120Hz refresh rate. NetEase's free-to-play RPG Destiny Rising has been confirmed to be among the first iOS games to utilize the 120Hz tech.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616"></a><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next is the vapor chamber cooling technology, which was also a feature of the Xbox One X. This cooling tech is designed to "enhance heat dissipation and performance" thanks to deionized water sealed inside the chamber, which is "laser-welded into the aluminum chassis to move heat away from the powerful A19 Pro, allowing it to operate at even higher performance levels," according to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/" rel="nofollow ">official announcement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gaming-relevant features found in the new set of iPhones include the A19 Pro chip, which sports a 6-core CPU and GPU architecture that Apple says will "deliver up to 40% better sustained performance than the previous generation." The new N1 wireless networking chip, meanwhile, will support Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread for online multiplayer games.</p><p dir="ltr">The iPhone 17 in all of its forms is set to launch September 19, with preorders scheduled to begin one week prior on September 12.</p>

For those playing on Steam, the demo will arrive as early as September 10.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that the console versions of the demo will all be arriving at the same time, while PC will unlock at different times depending on the region. Below is the breakdown for when the demo will be released in various regions.</p><h3 dir="ltr">PS5, Xbox Series X|S</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">September 11  <ul><li dir="ltr">12 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">12 AM CEST</li><li dir="ltr">12 AM JST</li></ul></li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Steam</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">September 10  <ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">September 11  <ul><li dir="ltr">12 AM CEST</li><li dir="ltr">7 AM JST</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">One big question fans have is whether or not progress made in the demo will carry over to the full game, and it's one we don't have an answer for at time of writing.

Producer Ryosuke Hara said the team looked to improve the games' battle system this time around to make it more balanced, resulting in what Reyes described as possibly the franchise's most comprehensive battle system yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Those interested don't need to have watched older Digimon shows or played the previous Digimon Story game, 2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth/" data-ref-id="5000-239106">Cyber Sleuth</a>, in order to understand this game's story, which revolves around a secret agent investigating a mysterious city-leveling explosion that is somehow connected to the digital world.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s loot grind is getting some major changes in its next expansion, including adjustments to make more activities more rewarding and to make gear more viable in the game's new Portal activity scoring system.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced several of the changes in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ?si=ZeoppwP1tjmrSn4-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming Renegades expansion, noting that many of them are responses to feedback from players in the wake of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion. Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with balance changes and adjustments, Bungie also detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">what's coming in the Renegades expansion</a> and mentioned some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-festival-of-the-lost-is-getting-new-activities-check-out-the-armor/1100-6534597/" data-ref-id="1100-6534597">changes to Destiny 2's Halloween event</a>, the Festival of the Lost--and showed of this year's spooky armor sets.</p>

                <p>Some of the best games around borrow from those that set the standard before them, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311"> Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel, is no exception. Protagonist Hornet differs from the first game's Vessel in a number of ways but also features some familiar-looking animations that might remind you of one of the most influential metroidvanias of all time.</p><p>If you've enjoyed flicking Hornet about on the screen, you may have noticed a curious movement she makes when changing direction. Instead of the character model flipping to the new direction you're moving in, Hornet backsteps and looks like she's turning to face it instead. Line that up against Alucard in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/" data-ref-id="5000-632"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, and it's obvious where this inspiration came from.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was going to praise Silksong for having animations similar to Alucard's, but seeing them side by side, it's the same character controller lol (I love that, by the way) <a href="https://t.co/gQLJ2yNlwS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gQLJ2yNlwS</a></p>  — Wallace Pires (@h_wallacepires) <a href="https://twitter.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>More of Hornet's animations, such as her standard and diagonal air attacks, bear some similarity to Alucard's own, but it's the backstep that looks almost ripped out of Konami's classic and endearingly recreated in its modern contemporary. Team Cherry hasn't commented on the comparison yet, but it's a nice touch that longtime fans of the genre are bond to appreciate the most.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong hasn't been out for a week yet, but it's already made a massive impact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">bringing down several storefronts</a> at launch before going on to secure more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">5 million players in total</a>. It's already generated some discussion over its difficulty and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">received a balance update</a> that should make early encounters a little less punishing, as well as a hidden mode that makes skirmishes even more brutal.</p>
