                <p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that Killing Floor 3, which had been scheduled to release on March 25, has been delayed to an unspecified date later this year. A number of changes will be made to the game both for the new launch date and afterward.</p><p>Chief among those changes is a post-release update that will separate perk classes from characters, letting the two be chosen independently. The initial change to tie your class choice to a character proved to be contentious with some fans, mirroring similar complaints about Battlefield 2042's debut with hero-style classes.</p><p>"With the full support of our parent company, Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel," the studio said in a <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "We can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release."</p><p>Refunds for preorders will <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">vary between platforms</a>. US-based PlayStation preorders will have the option to keep it or cancel, with non-responses being automatically canceled and refunded. Global PlayStation preorders will be automatically canceled and refunded too.</p><p>Xbox will automatically cancel all preorders and refunds are not necessary because the storefront only charges a user's account  7-10 days before launch.</p><p>On PC, Epic Games Store preorders are automatically canceled and refunded while Steam preorders will remain active unless a user cancels and refunds theirs manually.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 is a multiplayer survival horror game. It takes place in 2091, 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2. The mega-corporation Horzine has created a race of subservient and bioengineered zombies called Zeds. Nightfall, a rebel group, must fight back against the Zeds in order to save humanity.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 can be played solo or with up to five other people, and the game offers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-release-date-confirmed-for-march-2025/1100-6528441/" data-ref-id="1100-6528441">cross-play across all platforms</a>. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-launches-in-march-closed-beta-coming-in-february/1100-6529171/" data-ref-id="1100-6529171">beta occurred last month</a>, and GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/" data-ref-id="1100-6529407">Killing Floor 3 hands-on impressions</a> have been positive so far. We said, "Killing Floor 3 paints a terrific first impression, with impactful, gore-filled shooting and a promising glimpse of what can sustain it long-term."</p>
