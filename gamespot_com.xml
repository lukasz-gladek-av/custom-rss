                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/" data-ref-id="5000-654217">A Game About Digging A Hole</a> is the aptly named new game from indie developer Cyberwave, and it is, you guessed it, about digging a hole.</p><p dir="ltr">For what Cyberwave describes "costs as much of a coffee, but is fun for longer," A Game About Digging A Hole sees players buy a mysterious house for an "unbeatable price." That house just so happens to have buried treasure in the backyard, leading players to start digging to discover the riches underneath.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ys4PRZxsw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a simple premise with an even simpler gameplay loop. Players will dig, find treasure, sell those treasures, use the money to upgrade their digging tools, and keep digging deeper. The game's announcement trailer teases there may be something more sinister lurking in the deep, dark depths, but that will be for players to discover, as Cyberwave teases a "big secret" hidden beneath the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">An eye-catching and hilariously straightforward name definitely seems to be part of the game's marketing strategy. In a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Cyberwave asks players to help make the "quirky" project "go viral" so that it's "the game everyone's talking about."</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea for the game came during the development of Cyberwave's upcoming floating island survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solarpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-559930">Solarpunk</a>. It was experimenting with voxel-based terraforming, only to eventually ditch the idea. One of the game's artists, inspired by the tech and the game Motherload, then put together what would become A Game About Digging A Hole in just 14 days of his spare time. Solarpunk itself is not out yet and is planned for a 2025 release, but Cyberwave emphasized that A Game About Digging A Hole didn't take a single day from Solarpunk's development.</p><p dir="ltr">A Game About Digging A Hole doesn't have an exact release date or price just yet but is slated to arrive in 2025 for PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch continues to make improvements to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, with a small update arriving to both games on December 12. The patch notes include an increase to XP earn rates across various modes, and more maps are added to the popular 10v10 playlist for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Leveling up and Prestiging is quite the grind in Black Ops 6, but, thankfully, one of the biggest highlights of the update is the buff to XP earn rates. Both player XP and weapon XP rates are increased for Domination, Headquarters, Kill Order, and Search and Destroy playlists. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, and Control also received a buff but only to the earn rates for weapon XP. Additionally, player XP rates are increased for Prop Hunt.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2097564425" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

This includes a bug where players could unintentionally become invulnerable after using the Rampart Cannon, and another that could sometimes cause players to get stuck after being grabbed by the Amalgam enemy type.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warzone update is much smaller, but it does address a community complaint about a specific operator skin. Previously, Weaver's "Repairman" operator skin was hard to see and could unintentionally give an unfair advantage in battle royale, but the patch notes reveal that the skin should now properly display at farther distances.</p><p dir="ltr">Other Warzone bug fixes include one for an issue that would interrupt players while attempting to replace armor plates as well as collision issues with various elements across Urzikstan that previously allowed players to exploit them.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded recently added more multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and new DLC weapons.
