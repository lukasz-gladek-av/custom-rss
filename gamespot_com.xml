allow players to further customize their experience," the publisher says.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the familiar accessibility features that were included with Modern Warfare 3 will also be available in Black Ops 6, such as graphical adjustment options to reduce motion blur and joystick setting options. However, new settings aim to improve the customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes Black Ops 6's new asymmetrical hearing compensation setting, which allows players with asymmetrical hearing loss to create a custom audio profile and adjust audio settings for each ear. Activision says this was created with veterans and players with hearing loss in mind, allowing the audio settings to be individually customizable for each ear.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also recently detailed Black Ops 6's more immersive audio features and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-gets-audio-upgrades-plus-setting-to-help-with-tinnitus/1100-6527145/">discussed the new Reduce Tinnitus Sound accessibility setting</a>. In addition to audio features, Black Ops 6 will also include some new visual accessibility settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's High Contrast mode was first introduced in Modern Warfare 3, giving players the option to highlight allies and enemies during gameplay, but the feature was only available for the campaign. This year, High Contrast mode will be available to use in both campaign and Zombies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873"></a><figcaption>High Contrast mode in Zombies</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode has also been upgraded, so now players will be able to customize the color outline of allies and enemies, which allows those with vision impairment and color blindness to tailor their player experience even more. Players will even be able to enable a "Dark Background" setting in High Contrast mode, which further adds contrast from the background elements to assist with low vision. An example of this can be seen in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">Another newly introduced feature in Black Ops 6 is the ability to adjust the gameplay HUD with a variety of layout presets, as well as color adjustments for the minimap. Activision says that players who wish to reduce visual clutter or find the minimap distracting might want to test out the Target Tracker or Central Command presets.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Zombies maps feature spider-like enemies, so players will have an option to toggle on an optional arachnophobia setting, which visually removes the enemies' legs. The image shown below reveals how the enemy will look with and without the setting activated. Activision says this setting will change their appearance "without affecting their gameplay," but it's uncertain how this will work for the enemy hitboxes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874"></a><figcaption>Zombies mode arachnophobia setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another new feature for Zombies is the ability to pause, save, and then load back into games. It's worth noting that this feature comes with some restrictions. This pause and save feature is only available when playing solo matches, and a player can only save and quit while at full health.</p><p dir="ltr">"With the return of round-based Zombies, gameplay is guaranteed to be fast-paced and intense, so providing the ability to pause or save a solo game and return later can make all the difference in gameplay for some players," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the publisher confirms that both the Xbox Adaptive controller and Sony's Access controller will work out of the box with Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

But there's a catch: These eye-catching accessories appear to be exclusive to Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed via <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/10/23/20241023-ps5/" rel="nofollow ">a blog post on PlayStation Japan's website</a>, "limited quantities" of the themed controller and faceplate are scheduled to go on sale the same day the game launches. The items are sold separately, and will become available to preorder starting on October 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4389890-mhwcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389890" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4389890-mhwcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389890"></a><figcaption>The controller and matching faceplate are sold separately.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4389890-mhwcontroller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Volcanic Red controller features Monster Hunter's Forbidden Area Research Team logo on the touchpad, with a stylized floral print covering the handles. The black console cover is a bit more understated, with a small accent design on the lower right corner featuring the same logo in the same shade of red as the controller.</p><p>There's no telling if or when Monster Hunter-loving PlayStation owners in other markets will be able to get their hands on the new DualSense controller and PS5 faceplate, as both items seem to be Japan-only exclusives. But it's certainly hard to deny their beauty. One thing we do know, however, is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/">the game itself appears to be a wildly good time</a>, and for players who are truly desperate to get their hands on some functional Monster Hunter-themed merch, there's always <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fender-and-capcom-team-up-for-2000-monster-hunter-guitar/1100-6526765/" data-ref-id="1100-6526765">the $2,000 Monster Hunter Wilds-themed Fender guitar</a>.</p><p>Sony also has an array of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-chroma-collection-ps5-controllers-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526886/" data-ref-id="1100-6526886">other unique PS5 controllers</a> for sale via its new Chroma collection, so players still have plenty of ways to accessorize even if they can't get their hands on the new Monster Hunter controller.

                <p>A new patch has gone live for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the key takeaway from this update is that stealth missions should be less frustrating to play. Developer Massive Entertainment says that it has focused on improving stealth to give players more flexibility, and another welcome fix being introduced in the update is an improvement to speeder travel.</p><p>Stealth in Outlaws was fairly unforgiving when the game first launched, although this has been fine-tuned over the last couple of weeks. The new tweaks aim to reduce the frequency of instant-fail moments during specific missions, allowing players to have more options at their disposal to complete these sequences.</p><p>For speeder travel, the developer says it is "reducing collisions" with objects in the environment through this patch. A notorious bug in Outlaws, speeder travel could often result in Kay Vess experiencing low-orbit travel when she was flung from her vehicle while traveling on a seemingly safe route.</p><p>Massive says it also investigating other issues in the PC version of the game. "We are also aware of an ongoing issue affecting PC players after the 24H2 Windows Update," <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/2Vn4XE0lBNrsqFhfkqjrs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the studio wrote in the patch notes</a>. "We are working hard to identify both the root cause and its resolution. This investigation is taking some time; therefore, the fix couldn't be ready for this Title Update. We'll deploy one as soon as it's ready and update all affected players."</p><p>Other gameplay fixes include improved NPC behavior, increased auto-save opportunities in open-world hostile areas, and "Wanted" difficulty will now scale according to player progression. You can see the full patch notes below, which cover various other technical parts of the game as well.</p><p>This is the third major update for Outlaws, following its launch in August. While the game was generally well-received, it was criticized for a heavy number of bugs and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-early-instant-fail-missions-were-a-mistake-dev-admits/1100-6526350/" data-ref-id="1100-6526350">early instant-fail stealth missions</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">Ubisoft's stock took a huge hit after Star Wars Outlaws reportedly underperformed</a>. and the company's next big open-world game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">was delayed to February 14, 2025</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws Title

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age™: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Artifacts that have been dormant for centuries are awakening," a voiceover explains as a metallic monster somewhat resembling <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16786-animated-armor" rel="nofollow ">Animated Armor</a> roars to life and begins wreaking havoc. Later, an unseen creature with <em>far</em> too many tentacles can be seen grabbing a guard by the throat and (presumably) dragging him to his doom.</p><p dir="ltr">"The dead… stir more easily than they should," remarks Emmrich Volkarin, who serves as a companion character and The Veilguard's resident necromancer. Another voiceover comments that dragons have been "feeding on the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Blight" rel="nofollow ">Blight</a>," and announces that "<a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspawn" rel="nofollow ">Darkspawn</a> are charging to <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Weisshaupt" rel="nofollow ">Weisshaupt</a>," which serves as the headquarters of the Grey Wardens faction. Frankly, things are <em>not</em> looking good for Thedas and its inhabitants in the new trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also depicts the game's main antagonist, Solas, who can be seen wielding the unstable power he's gained from ripping open <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Veil" rel="nofollow ">The Veil</a>, with eyes glowing a greenish-blue as magic swirls around his hands. Solas himself was a romance option for players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, though he's not on the companion roster this time around (which is fair--destroying the world really puts a damper on any potential chance for romance). All in all, it seems that Rook and the rest of The Veilguard crew will have quite a few challenges to conquer if they hope to save Thedas from Solas' wicked plans.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches on October 31.
