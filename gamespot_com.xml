                <p>After adding two-player expeditions in the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, From Software's latest patch is adding some balance adjustments to the powerful abilities that come with the legendary sword known as Storm Ruler.</p><p>Going forward, it won't take as long to charge the storm effect and the animation speed of the blade will be faster. Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations. Performance issues appear to have been the main problems addressed in the patch, but there were others as well, including a bug that prevented some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign Caligo, Miasma of Night from hitting other players.</p><p>There was also one bug fix that specific to PlayStation 5, where both the user interface and the heads-up display might disappear for players. That bug might be followed by the game crashing altogether if players attempted to continue playing.</p><p>What's coming next for Nightreign after this patch? A recent datamine suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/" data-ref-id="1100-6533778">a ranked mode may be debuting on Nightreign</a> in the future. Last month, Bandai Namco and From Software announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">Nightreign has shipped 5 million copies</a> since its debut at the end of May.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-confirmed-for-switch-2/1100-6530541/" data-ref-id="1100-6530541">Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year, which will include the base game and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. There's also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-director-is-more-than-familiar-with-the-game/1100-6532534/" data-ref-id="1100-6532534">live-action Elden Ring movie in development from A24 with Alex Garland slated to direct.</a></p><p>The complete patch notes for Elden Ring Nightreign version 1.02.1 are included below.</p><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Increased the performance of the skill "Storm Ruler"</li><li>Reduced the time to charge the storm effect</li><li>Increased the speed of the blade unleashed by the attack</li><li>Increased the attack power when not charged with the storm</li></ul><h3>Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, using dropped items would prevent any actions other than moving and camera operation.</li><li>Fixed a bug where effects triggered by successful guards would not activate for certain guard actions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where target lock would immediately be released on eggs or insects parasitizing the player character when Duchess's Ultimate Art "Finale" effect is active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks by Everdark Sovereign "Maris, Fathom of Night" would cause stagger damage when negated with the Executor's Skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, the relic effect "[Executor] While Character Skill is active, unlocking use of cursed sword restores HP" would not activate.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the skill "Storm Ruler" could be used without consuming FP by specific steps.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the damage dealt to enemies by the passive effect "Frostbite Produces a Mist of Frost" was higher than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where using a Flask would not heal the player's own HP when equipped with relics that have the effect "Flask Also Heals Allies".</li><li>Note: We have identified a bug where healing is not distributed or the amount of healing distributed changes for allies who have acquired the passive effect "Gradual Restoration by Flask."
