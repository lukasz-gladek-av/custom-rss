                <p>MindsEye launched earlier this month but didn't come out of the gate in a great state, with players encountering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/" data-ref-id="1100-6532343">range of problems, bugs, and other issues</a>. Actor Alex Hernandez, who plays main character Jake Diaz, has now commented on the game's buggy release, offering up his take on what might have happened.</p><p>Speaking to Check It TV, Hernandez he believes developer Build a Rocket Boy decided to launch MindsEye with issues with a plan to fix them after launch.</p><p>"It's not a lack of QA. I met the QA testers and they seemed competent at their job. But for whatever reason, the company decided to release something that has these issues and then taking care of it post-release... obviously we were not the first game to do that," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxfAyV7XBTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxfAyV7XBTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hernandez said Cyberpunk 2077 is an example of another game that launched in a rough state and was then improved over time with updates.</p><p>Hernandez went on to say that he "doesn't love" the model of a developer selling a game for full price with issues at launch and then fixing it over time.</p><p>"I don't love that model," he said. "I'm not a business person. I have no idea why that decision gets made. I will just say that from a consumer perspective, and I am sure a lot of people feel this way, I think it does more long-term harm than good to your reputation to release something that feels like it is in a state of less-than 100%, and then charge 100% of the price."</p><p>Additionally, Hernandez said he would rather see developers embrace an early-access model where the developer is up-front with players about issues so that fans know what they are signing up for.</p><p>Just ahead of the release of MindsEye, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">pair of senior executives left the developer</a>, while Build a Rocket Boy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/" data-ref-id="1100-6532630">said to be cutting staff following the game's release.</a> The game was published by Hitman studio IO Interactive.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is headed up by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar Games veteran. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> scored the game a 3/10. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings. If you're looking for quality, cast your mind's eye elsewhere," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p>
