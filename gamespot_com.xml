                <p dir="ltr">Starting May 1, Monopoly Go players might see some characters appearing from a galaxy far, far away. That's because the mobile game is getting a Star Wars collaboration that will see Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader meeting up with Mr. Monopoly.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced at Star Wars Celebration Japan, the Monopoly Go crossover will cover the Skywalker Saga as well as The Mandalorian. Confirmed characters coming to the game (along with the previously mentioned) include Han Solo, R2-D2, Yoda, Anakin Skywalker, and Qui-Gon Jinn. There will be a Star Wars Go sticker album to unlock as well as special tokens, shields, and emojis. The Star Wars collaboration will run through July 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiQvlMOScAw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TiQvlMOScAw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Monopoly Go was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023s-apparent-biggest-mobile-game-launch-is-not-what-you-expect/1100-6519222/">the biggest mobile game launch of 2023</a>, according to developer Scopely. The free-to-play game reportedly brought in over $2 billion in revenue after just 10 months of availability. In addition, Scopely apparently spent $500 million on marketing and user acquisition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monopoly-go-devs-spent-more-on-marketing-than-it-cost-to-develop-the-last-of-us-2/1100-6521930/">which is more than The Last of Us Part II reportedly cost to develop</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Scopely might sound familiar, even if you don't play Monopoly Go. That's because the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">acquired Pokemon Go studio Niantic last month for $3.5 billion</a>. Scopely is owned by Savvy Games Group, headquartered in Saudi Arabia.</p><p dir="ltr">Another announcement from Star Wars Celebration Japan was the official unveiling of Star Wars Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling. Fascinatingly enough, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ryan-gosling-star-wars-movie-has-same-name-as-this-great-ps2-game/1100-6530960/">that name is the same as a PS2 game</a> from 2001. However, the film slated to arrive in 2027 takes place after Rise of the Skywalker while the 2001 video game was set during the prequel trilogy.</p>

                <p>Marvel has announced the return of the Marvel Swimsuit Special later this year, teasing that the new issue will include some future skins for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel announced in a <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> that a new swimsuit special, titled Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1, releases on July 9. As part of the announcement, Marvel said the issues will also contain designs for Marvel Rivals skins in the issue. It certainly sounds like that means swimsuit skins are coming to Marvel Rivals, and a late July or early August event would work perfectly with the summer skins. The blog post doesn't provide any more details about who would be getting these skins, or even what the skins are, but considering they are in the swimsuit issue, they will probably be beach-appropriate.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956" data-ratio="0.75872093023256" data-width="2064" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956"></a><figcaption>Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Marvel Swimsuit Special features a loose plot, with this year's based around Wasp organizing an official swimsuit special after Roxxon Comics made an unofficial one. This is just a pretense to the real plot, which is magazine-style spread of art featuring Marvel characters in swimsuits. Marvel said it would be revealing more about the issue leading up to its release, which could include teases of the Marvel Rivals skins. Based on the blog post, it sounds like it will just include designs that will be in Marvel Rivals and not skins that you can only get by purchasing the comic.</span></p><p>Marvel Rivals has seen continued success since its launch, recently releasing Emma Frost as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-update-adds-emma-frost-krakoa-map-and-cosmetic-gifting/1100-6530825/">Season 2</a>, themed after the Hellfire Gala. It also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-recolor-skins-every-one-revealed-so-far/2900-6485/">new colors</a> for existing skins.</p>
