                <p>Microsoft will soon expand the roster of titles in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">Game Pass Core</a> library, something it rarely does. The cheapest Game Pass tier ($10/month) will add three more games on March 26.</p><p>These include three celebrated games: Batman: Arkham Knight, Monster Sanctuary, and Tunic.</p><p>An evolution of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass Core grants subscribers access to dozens of games on console, as well as online multiplayer access and member-exclusive discounts. As mentioned, Game Pass Core's game library doesn't get updated very often, making this a notable event.</p><p>Microsoft describes the Core catalog as being "curated," and indeed the three upcoming releases are all pretty highly regarded. There are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#coreall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 games in the Core catalog</a>, so the upcoming three will push the Core library to 50 titles in all. Game Pass Core is available only on console.</p><p>Some of the other games in the Core catalog include Vampire Survivors, Halo 5, Stardew Valley, Limbo, Hellblade, Fallout 76, Grounded, Firewatch, Dishonored 2, Celeste, and Among Us.</p><p>By comparison, Game Pass Standard ($15/month) includes "hundreds" of games, while Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) includes all of that plus day-one new releases for all first-party games, cloud gaming access, and an EA Play membership.</p><p>As for Game Pass Ultimate, the library grows this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">a bunch more games</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-10-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6327/" data-ref-id="2900-6327">10 games are getting axed soon</a>.</p>

                <p>If you fondly remember the old days of Counter-Strike before newfangled inventions like the Source engine, we've got good news for you. The mod team behind CSPromod has announced CS: Legacy, a standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built entirely in Valve's Source SDK.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PspuiHlF5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PspuiHlF5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you can see from the above announcement trailer, the project features classic maps like de_nuke, all gussied up with 4K textures. It even has the static falling-over death animation that Counter-Strike 1.6 players remember well. According to the trailer, the project is coming to Steam Early Access in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Posts on the project's Discord suggest that the initial release will include the classic maps Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, and Aim_map. The small team behind CS: Legacy previously worked together on CSPromod back in the 2000s, which was an attempt to bring CS 1.6-style gameplay to the Source engine. The original Counter-Strike released in 2000, and was replaced with Counter-Strike: Source in 2004, a change that was considered controversial in the community at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Counter-Strike news, in a documentary released for the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2's release, Valve discussed a Counter-Strike-based <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reflects-on-lawsuit-that-could-have-killed-the-company/1100-6527883/" data-ref-id="1100-6527883">lawsuit with Vivendi</a> that nearly destroyed the company. Essentially, Valve accused Vivendi of distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission; the suit was later settled.</p>

                <p>Peaky Blinders is no stranger to video games--we've already had VR and puzzle adventures based on the TV series--but for its next appearance, the crime series is joining forces with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a> for some mechanized warfare. Developer Wargaming Group has announced a new battle pass that'll be available for a limited time, and this one will deliver a variety of Peaky Blinders-themed rewards to players, as well as Tommy Shelby himself and several members of his family.</p><p>The Peaky Blinders battle pass will be available starting March 20 through March 31, and it'll include five characters to unlock. Each character will be fully voiced, but it hasn't been confirmed if the original actors are involved in this crossover.</p>

This is a World War I tank that has been given a Shelby makeover and it references the global conflict that three of the Shelby brothers took part in prior to the start of Peaky Blinders. There'll also be new Peaky Blinders-themed decals, inscriptions, and a specially composed soundtrack inspired by the show.</p><p>While Peaky Blinders sounds like an odd fit for World of Tanks, it's not unusual for the free-to-play game.

In case you never saw it, Peaky Blinders is a British crime-drama series that ran six seasons from 2013 through to 2022.</p><p>Starring Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby, the show charted the rise of the Peaky Blinders street gang in Birmingham and their evolution into a well-oiled criminal syndicate. A film is also currently in the works.</p>

                <p>33 Immortals launches in early access today, March 18, and developer Thunder Lotus has provided <a href="https://thunderlotus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29838745552404-33-Immortals-FAQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some details about game</a>, including cross-play functionality.</p><p>33 Immortals is a roguelike action multiplayer game that supports up to 33 players in its raid missions. The game has cross-play between PC and Xbox players. Right now, the developer said that it is focusing on creating a finished product, so no other platforms or storefronts have been announced like PlayStation, Switch, or Steam.</p><p>33 Immortals is not a free-to-play game, but it will be available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">Game Pass</a> subscribers. There will also be optional cosmetics in the game. Those who participated in the game's alpha and beta tests will receive a unique halo item during the early-access period.</p><p>The developer laid out a <a href="https://thunderlotusgames.com/blog/33-immortals-roadmap-release-time-and-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">roadmap for the game for the rest of 2025</a>. In Spring 2025, the focus will be on fixing bugs and stability issues, as well as balancing UI/UX, VFX, and overall game feel. Accessibility options, control rebinding, and graphics settings will be added too.</p><p>Summer 2025 will focus on new features, including private sessions, Dark Woods decorations, and more trainings. Players will also get the ability to descend after ascending and check out a new ordeal system.</p><p>Fall 2025 will have the game's first major update, which includes a new world called Paradiso, filled with new monsters, a new boss, and even more new features.</p><p>33 Immortals is a departure for Thunder Lotus games. The studio has dabbled in co-op with Sundered and Spiritfarer, but 33 Immortals is its first fully multiplayer game. It has one dedicated single-player game, Jotun, while Sundered and Spiritfarer can be played as single-player adventures.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Apparently it's possible to be guilty of a "hate crime to parkour." Unfortunately for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> protagonist Yasuke, he is culpable in this department, according to a couple of experts in navigating urban obstacles.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed-parkour-experts-video/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> rounded up two parkour athletes, Benj and Toby from Storror Parkour Pro, to discuss what is actually realistic in Assassin's Creed Shadows and what's nigh impossible. The pair took issue with Yasuke using his knee to ascend a ledge, laughing while addressing the problem. "You'll be canceled out of any parkour community around the world," said Benj. Toby added salt to the wound by saying, "That's a hate crime to parkour that climb up there. Yeah, that's brutal." Yasuke is one of two playable characters in the game, with Naoe serving as the more agile option.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQIPl5ss9cU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BQIPl5ss9cU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Basically, the duo explained that parkour should never include utilizing your knees to climb up somewhere. The same is true for your elbows, since those actions are terrible for your joints. Intriguingly, the franchise's iconic leap of faith is actually realistic--from certain distances. They argue jumping off from shorter distances, say no more than seven stories, could be possible with a good amount of hay. But when Assassin's Creed heroes dive off from 30-plus stories, that's a no-go.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days away from release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-stream-assassins-creed-shadows-if-they-buy-the-game/1100-6530144/">Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to stream Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> if they buy the game. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-support-steam-deck-at-release-ubisoft-confirms/1100-6530082/">confirmed the action-adventure title will work on Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-on-ps5-pro-will-have-an-extra-fancy-ray-tracing-mode/1100-6529947/">PS5 Pro owners will get an extra-fancy ray tracing mode</a>.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>. The game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-how-long-to-beat-game-director-reveals-a-runtime/1100-6529911/">apparently take about 30-40 hours to complete the main campaign</a>, but that playtime can easily double when including side quests and other activities. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows comes out March 20</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>
