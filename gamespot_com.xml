                <p>Starfield was originally planned to have a gore and dismemberment system like Fallout, with players being able to more gruesomely kill foes. However, these features were ultimately left out of Starfield.</p><p>In an interview with Kiwi Talkz, former senior character artist Dennis Mejillones said that there were technical considerations when it came to the space suits. "There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off; you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is," he explained. "We had systems for all of that, and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for."</p><p>With the feature of being able to customize body size in the character creator, that added more complications. Mejillones also said that gore and dismemberment didn't fit with Starfield's themes as opposed to Fallout's over-the-top presentation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2697">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ebSmOGZnmeM?start=2697" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk where you can make a mess out of something and blow up? It's part of the fun," he explained.</p><p>He added that Starfield was meant to be more realistic, so gore and dismemberment didn't fit in thematically. With the technical costs factored in, it was decided that gore would be scrapped from the game.</p><p>Other former Starfield developers have shared their thoughts on the game and the industry at large. One said that they were surprised at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-starfield-dev-surprised-by-the-number-of-loading-screens-it-could-have-existed-without-those/1100-6528530/" data-ref-id="1100-6528530">number of loading screens</a> Starfield had, and another Bethesda veteran said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-veteran-says-players-are-fatigued-by-seemingly-endless-games/1100-6528653/" data-ref-id="1100-6528653">players are fatigued by long games</a>.</p><p>Starfield is currently on PC and Xbox Series X|S. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-responds-to-ps5-rumors-for-starfield-gears-of-war/1100-6520838/" data-ref-id="1100-6520838">rumors that the game will come to PS5</a>, as Microsoft has already ported some of its other first-party titles to rival platforms, but nothing has been confirmed yet. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">Elder Scrolls VI</a> is also in the works, still with no release window since its announcement <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-elder-scrolls-6-just-reached-a-sad-milestone/1100-6528679/" data-ref-id="1100-6528679">almost seven years ago</a>.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Nintendo may announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on Thursday, January 16, and then launch the console possibly in May or June.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate</a>, who has accurately reported on unannounced information before about upcoming video game announcements, said in a video that the Switch 2 reveal is coming this week. He said the announcement will focus almost entirely on the system itself, with no mention of games, though the announcement video may contain footage of games running on the system.</p><p>Reporter <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge </a>also noted that he expects the Switch 2 to be announced this week.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-reportedly-reveal-switch-2-this-week/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, meanwhile, reported that its own sources backed up NateTheHate's suggestion that the Switch 2 could launch in May or June 2025. A new Mario Kart game may be a launch title, the site said, with a new 3D Mario game coming holiday 2025.</p><p>It's already been reported that Nintendo is working on Mario Kart 9, and that the game could include a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/" data-ref-id="1100-6499581">"new twist."</a> The Mario Kart series is massively popular, and putting out a new game for the Switch 2's launch would no doubt help generate even more interest in the console.</p><p>In the absence of official news, there has been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">flurry of leaks and reports about the Switch 2</a>. The Switch 2, or whatever the system may be called, has enormous shoes to fill, as the original Switch sold more than 146 million systems and 1.3 billion games.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest on the Switch 2.

Some of the films that have succeeded the most, including 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, were created in partnership with the game developers themselves.
