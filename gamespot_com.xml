                <p>The smartphone in your pocket can be a surprisingly versatile gaming device, but admittedly, touchscreen controls aren't the best. Fortunately, there's a wide range of accessories that you can equip to your phone, <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and this new magnetic case from MCon</a> looks like it'll hit the Goldilocks zone for functionality and compact design. Now available to preorder for $145 (was $150), the MCon is designed to fit "most" phones using its magnetic clamps.</p><div title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4894" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">$145 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>In addition to being a pocket-friendly device, the MCon features some high-end technology inside it. It has deployable grips for ergonomic comfort, Hall-Effect analog triggers, GameSir anti-stick drift joysticks, and a built-in gyroscope for motion controls. Another cool feature with this controller is that it has a button-activated slider that raises your phone into playing position with a single smooth motion. Kickback Mode allows you to remove the control cover and prop your phone up for tabletop play.</p><p>The controller also supports games that are played in Portrait Mode, and it features all the inputs you'd expect for modern-day gaming. The device also has silent face buttons, and it attaches to your phone with two magnetic pucks to keep your camera bumps away from the controller, ensuring a level fit. When not in use, the MCon measures just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, to make it easy to store in your pocket. It's available to preorder in white or black.</p></div>                      </div><p>The MCon was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign that blew past its initial funding goal of $25,000, earning over $1.7 million in crowdfunding. Part of the appeal for the device is that it has a user-friendly design, as manufacturer Oh Snap designed it to be moddable, upgradeable, and repairable. Smartphone controllers have become popular over the last couple of years, thanks in part to subscription services like Netflix and Crunchyroll offering a library of games for members to access, and there are several brands out there that offer high-quality add-ons like this.</p><p>One of the biggest is Backbone, as it currently sells controllers that are also portable and make mobile gaming a more pleasant experience. The company recently announced a collaboration with Hideo Kojima's studio to produce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-new-death-stranding-2-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-from-the-games-world/1100-6535766/" data-ref-id="1100-6535766">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Backbone controller</a>, but if you're in a rush, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One with a USB-C connection</a> is available for $100, and for older iPhones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Backbone One with a Lightning connection</a> is available at the same price.</p><p>The Backbone Ones have a solid design, but if you're looking for a more premium controller with better parts inside, the company's premium smartphone controller--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>--is worth considering, with Hall Effect triggers, quiet face buttons, and full-sized ALPS analog sticks.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                                        <p>Every decision counts in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. From the smallest lie in a conversation to the biggest choice between warring factions, every move you make ripples through the Arcadia colony--shifting alliances, rewriting quests, and redefining what kind of commander you are. Obsidian Entertainment’s latest sci-fi RPG doesn’t just tell you your choices matter--it makes you feel it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A colony on the brink</span></h2><p>Set in the new frontier of Arcadia, the sequel drops you into a world tearing itself apart. The Protectorate’s so-called benevolent rule is being challenged by rebels of a rising religious order, while opportunistic corporations close in to claim what’s left. As devastating rifts spread across the system, you’re tasked with uncovering their source--but who you trust (and who you betray) could decide whether Arcadia survives or collapses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Choices that echo through every mission</span></h2><p>In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, no two playthroughs will ever look the same. Dialogue choices can unlock alternate solutions, close off others, or completely change how characters respond to you later. Promise loyalty to a faction, and doors will open--but betray them, and those doors might slam shut for good. Even seemingly small moments, like a sarcastic quip or a quick act of mercy, can come back around hours later in surprising ways.</p><p>Obsidian’s trademark cause-and-effect storytelling is in full force here. You’re constantly juggling competing motivations--moral, political, and personal--as the colony reacts to your growing reputation. Maybe you’re a peacemaker trying to broker stability, or maybe you lean into chaos, playing every side until only yours is left standing. The brilliance lies in how the game never tells you which is right--it just lets you live with the fallout.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Relationships that remember</span></h2><p>Your companions are more than just party members--they’re witnesses to your leadership. They’ll react to your choices, question your motives, and sometimes even walk away if your ideals clash too deeply. The relationships you build (or burn) with them can alter entire questlines, shaping not only their stories but your own. Whether you lead with empathy, ambition, or pure self-interest, Arcadia, and the people in it, will remember.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A galaxy that bends to you</span></h2><p>Across its sprawling environments--from sun-scorched deserts to neon-drenched cities--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> keeps the focus on agency. Exploration feeds directly into consequence: the terminals you hack, secrets you uncover, and decisions you make along the way all inform how the colony evolves.

                                        <p>For RPG fans, there’s nothing quite like the moment a new world opens up before you--when the menu fades, the music swells, and you realise you can go anywhere. Role-playing games have always offered that rare kind of escapism: the chance to step into a different life, shape your own story, and lose yourself in a universe that feels alive.</p><p>With <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, Obsidian Entertainment captures that feeling again--the thrill of exploration, the satisfaction of choice, and the joy of seeing a world shift around your actions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every corner of Arcadia tells a story worth discovering.</span></h2><p>Arcadia, the colony at the heart of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, feels like a place built for wandering. Every outpost, settlement, and alien landscape tells its own story. The conversations you overhear, the missions you stumble into, even the way the sky shifts above you--it all makes the world feel lived-in. There’s a sense of texture to everything, like the game wants you to slow down and take it in rather than rush to the next objective.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every build tells a different story about the kind of player you are</span></h2><p>Part of what makes RPGs so magnetic is the chance to decide who you’ll become. In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you build your commander from the ground up--their look, their skills, their attitude. Some players might choose a smooth-talking diplomat who navigates danger through dialogue, while others prefer a stealthy tactician or a fearless brawler. However you play, your approach changes how the story unfolds and how the world responds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The story evolves around the paths you choose to take</span></h2><p>Every decision in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> feels like it matters. The alliances you form, the people you help, and the promises you break all ripple through Arcadia. Sometimes the effects are immediate. Other times they echo hours later, catching you off guard in ways that feel human. It’s that balance of consequence and curiosity that makes RPGs so rewarding -- the sense that your version of the story truly belongs to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The Outer Worlds 2 captures what makes immersion feel so special</span></h2><p>At their best, RPGs give you space to disappear for a while--not to avoid reality, but to explore new ones. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> understands that pull completely. It builds a world worth escaping into, filled with choices that challenge you, characters that surprise you, and moments that stick long after you’ve logged off.</p><p>For anyone who loves rich storytelling and total creative freedom, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a must-play. It’s available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to Arcadia and everything it holds. Whether you’re an Obsidian loyalist or new to the series, this is the kind of game that reminds you why RPGs have always been the most rewarding way to play--because they give you the space to explore, to imagine, and to make every world your own.</p><p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/the-outer-worlds-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox</a></p>

                                        <p>The wait is finally over--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> has officially landed, and it’s every bit the interstellar adventure fans have been hoping for. From Obsidian Entertainment, the masters of sharp-tongued sci-fi and branching RPGs, this sequel catapults players into a brand-new colony--Arcadia--for a story filled with danger, discovery, and difficult choices that can change the fate of an entire galaxy.</p><p>Set in the far reaches of space, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> casts you as a daring (and, as the game cheekily reminds you, “most likely good-looking”) Earth Directorate agent tasked with investigating mysterious rifts tearing through reality. These fractures threaten humanity itself, and your mission to uncover their source leads you straight into Arcadia--a colony at war with itself. Here, the Protectorate’s iron-fisted rule is being challenged by rebellious religious orders and encroaching corporate powers. Every side claims to be saving the system, so it’s up to you to decide who to believe… or who to betray.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2>A new world, shaped by your choices</h2><p>At its heart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is everything fans loved about the original--moral grey areas, biting humour, and choices that actually matter--but turned up several notches. Every skill point, dialogue option, and faction alliance can shift how your story unfolds. Whether you’re a smooth-talking diplomat, a chaos-loving gunslinger, or someone who just likes to press every sarcastic response possible, Arcadia reacts in kind.</p><p>This time around, Obsidian gives you even more freedom to define your character. You can build your commander from the ground up--complete with unique strengths, flaws, and backstory traits that influence how others see you (and how you see yourself). Your abilities, decisions, and even your mistakes ripple out into the world, altering relationships and rewriting your path as the story progresses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A crew worth crossing galaxies for</span></h2><p>No space-faring hero travels alone, and the companions you recruit along the way bring their own secrets, loyalties, and motivations to the mix. Each has something to fight for--and something to hide. Helping them achieve their goals can earn their trust… or put you on opposite sides of a battlefield. Between missions, your ship becomes a hub for witty banter, tense arguments, and the kind of heartfelt moments that make every journey feel personal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597833-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597833-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597833"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597833-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Exploration with purpose</span></h2><p>The Arcadia colony itself is a visual and narrative feast--from the gleaming cities of corporate elites to lush alien jungles where danger lurks behind every neon bloom. Every zone offers hidden lore, powerful loot, and new decisions that push your moral compass in uncomfortable directions. As the rifts grow more unstable and factions close in, it’s easy to lose yourself in the thrill of exploration--and the chaos that comes with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597834-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_04-explore-a-new-frontier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597834-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_04-explore-a-new-frontier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597834"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597834-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_04-explore-a-new-frontier.jpg"></figure><p><span>Whether you’re a returning space captain or boarding the series for the first time, </span><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em><span> is ready for takeoff right now.

                <p>This year, Naughty Dog is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a studio, which had humble beginnings compared to its current status as one of Sony's most important first-party developers. Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin formed the company when they were still teenagers, and the foundation they built continues long after they left Naughty Dog. Now, Naughty Dog has shared a retrospective video for its 40th anniversary that revisits some of its greatest hits while looking ahead to the future.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_EIOxtOVY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rT_EIOxtOVY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gavin and Rubin discuss the company's earliest origins, which date back to their time in school. The video doesn't focus much on the company's largely forgotten early titles, including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior. Instead, it marks the debut of the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter franchises as a turning point for Naughty Dog.</p><p>From there, the retrospective moves on to the company's cinematic action era that began in 2007 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune/" data-ref-id="5000-26749">Uncharted</a>, and continues through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part 2</a> and the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. A few brief scenes from Intergalactic was shown as studio manager and head of operations Alison Mori said, "I know our studio will continue to create amazing story-driven, character-based games that touch upon the human experience."</p><p>"I hope the future holds more of what Naughty Dog has always done," added Rubin. "Being at the forefront of making entertainment that is of the highest possible quality, telling the stories it wants to tell, with depth and meaning."</p><p>Earlier this year, Gavin shared his opinion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-co-founder-says-one-simple-change-made-crash-bandicoot-remakes-worse/1100-6533250/" data-ref-id="1100-6533250">the change made to the Crash Bandicoot remakes</a> that made the games worse. Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-reveals-why-he-decided-to-leave-the-last-of-us-tv-show/1100-6534673/" data-ref-id="1100-6534673">stepped away from The Last of Us TV show</a> to focus on his work at the studio. Druckmann has since teased that Intergalactic has "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">the deepest gameplay we've ever done</a>." However, the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Arcades may be largely a thing of the past, but some of the bigger cabinets of the '90s offered players co-op battles and head-to-head match-ups that consoles of that era couldn't match. Now, one of those games, Namco's Tokyo Wars, is finally getting its first console port after debuting in 1996.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55XrAWvTksk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/55XrAWvTksk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tokyo Wars is coming to modern consoles as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives and Arcade Archives 2 collections. The game lets players control a tank or a team of tanks as they face off against a rival team in Tokyo's downtown district or the city's bayside dock. In the arcades, up to eight players could take part in Tokyo Wars' head-to-head battles if four two-player cabinets were linked together. The cabinets also featured an air-powered recoil that simulated the sensation of tank fire.</p><p>It's important to note that the Arcade Archives version for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch don't have as many options as the Arcade Archives 2 version on other consoles. In the former, players will get the original arcade game, a high-score mode, and a caravan mode that gives players 10-minutes to come out on top. Each of those modes will support online rankings.</p><p>However, only the Arcade Archive 2 versions on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Switch 2 will offer split-screen multiplayer, a time attack mode, and VRR support. Tokyo Wars' Arcade Archive 1 and 2 versions are both available now on their consoles' respective digital storefronts.</p><p>If you're looking for a quieter arcade experience, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/golden-tee-arcade-classics/" data-ref-id="5000-682677">Golden Tee Arcade Classics collection</a> was released earlier this year.
