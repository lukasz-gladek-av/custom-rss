                <p>It's official: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed</a>. The highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-open-world-games/2900-6388/" data-ref-id="2900-6388" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-open-world-games/2900-6388/">open-world game</a> from Rockstar was originally scheduled for a May 2026 release, but it will now be out on November 19 instead. A game delay is never good news, but for Take-Two Interactive, the news saw its stock price temporarily drop while the industry calibrated itself for the later launch.</p><p>GTA 6 is regarded as something truly special, a once-in-a-generation release that is being fueled by an absurd amount of hype. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/">Even a simple YouTube trailer dominates discussions for days</a> after it's released--and reignites interest in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers--and the delay has gotten a lot of responses from just about everyone with their finger on the pulse of the gaming community.</p><p>Big brands like Dominos Pizza and KFC haven't missed with their responses, and someone at Red Bull Gaming needs to stop drinking a dangerous amount of overly caffeinated energy drinks. Some of the responses have been brutally honest, others have taken the news in their stride with cheeky responses, and some people have overreacted really badly to the delay.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a lot of games scheduled to launch next year, and if you want to plan around GTA 6, you can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/" data-ref-id="1100-6534941" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/">2026 game releases</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT <a href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1">https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1</a></p>— Red Bull Gaming (@redbullgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Several analysts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/">GTA 6 is the single most important game release of all time</a>, and its predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/">sell 40 million units within its first year of release</a>.

                <p>Rockstar's 2018 open-world Western Red Dead Redemption 2 is a huge success with more than 79 million copies sold, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top five best-selling games in history</a>. The game is expected to continue to make a mark on the gaming industry with rumored ports for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. The ports have not been officially announced, but there have been some developments, and in this post, we're rounding up everything we've heard about the rumored ports.</p><h2 id="What_do_we_know_"><strong>What do we know?</strong></h2><p>Earlier this year, reliable leaker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Nate the Hate said</a> a port of Red Dead Redemption 2 was headed to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, alongside an update that improves the game on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S already through backwards compatibility. That was also true for GTA 5, which was playable on the latest consoles prior to Rockstar releasing new versions of GTA 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in March 2022 with significant upgrades.</p><p>Then in October 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">Nate the Hate said the ports are still in the works</a>, but had no information to share regarding when they could be released.</p><p>There is no word on what the rumored PS5 and Xbox Series X|S upgrades could be, but improved graphics and performance are two possibilities.</p><p>The original Red Dead Redemption, meanwhile, came to Switch in 2023 after it originally launched in 2010.</p><h2 id="What_has_Rockstar_Take_Two_said_"><strong>What has Rockstar/Take-Two said?</strong></h2><p>Officially, Rockstar and Take-Two have not said a peep about new ports of Red Dead Redemption 2. However, the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/a8a1ef24-f159-4c6e-98df-f33c34a1dd3e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">company's latest earnings briefing</a> included a slide that said Take-Two has eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028.</p><p>This includes remasters and ports, and only four have been confirmed as of yet: these are Civilization 7 for Meta Quest VR (released April 10, 2025), Civilization 7 for Switch 2 (released June 5, 2025), WWE 2K25 for Switch 2 (released July 22, 2025), and Borderlands 4 for Switch 2 (TBA).</p><p>It's possible ports of Red Dead Redemption 2 could be among those ports/remasters that have yet to be announced. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">rumored GTA 4 remaster</a> could be another. The previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/">Max Payne remakes</a> could be counted here as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598588-screenshot2025-11-07at10.39.53%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598588" data-ratio="0.55621805792164" data-width="1174" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598588-screenshot2025-11-07at10.39.53%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598588"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption 2 may be headed to more platforms.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598588-screenshot2025-11-07at10.39.53%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 id="When_will_the_RDR_2_ports_be_released_">When will the RDR 2 ports be released?</h2><p>If the rumors are true, Red Dead Redemption 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 could launch before the end of 2025.</p><h2 id="Preorder_the_RDR_2_ports">Preorder the RDR 2 ports</h2><p>Given that Red Dead Redemption 2 ports for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 have not been announced, there is no word on preorder availability.</p><h2 id="RDR_2_ports_trailer">RDR 2 ports trailer</h2><p>There are no trailers yet for the possible Red Dead Redemption 2 ports, nor have there been any trailer leaks that have been posted publicly online.</p><h2 id="Rockstar_s_next_release">Rockstar's next release</h2><p>Rockstar's next big release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, which was recently delayed from May 2026 to November 2026. It remains to be seen if Rockstar itself would develop the possible new versions of RDR 2 or if the company might hire an outside studio to do the work.</p><h2 id="Take_Two_s_stance_on_ports">Take-Two's stance on ports</h2><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two is a big believer in ports, and CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company takes time and care to ensure the company does "the very best job we can making the title different for the new release."</p><p>"We improve the technology, we upgrade the visuals, and we make performance enhancements. And that's why I think our remastered titles typically do so well," <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstar-owner-discusses-remasters-strategy-says-its-not-interested-in-simple-ports/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said.</a> "We don't just port titles over."</p><p>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, which included updated versions of three GTA games from developer Grove Street, launched in 2021 and was beset by numerous technical issues. Despite this, the game was apparently a massive success, selling an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-remastered-trilogy-10-million-units-technical-issues" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimated 10 million copies.</a></p><hr><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more as new information comes to light.</p>

                <p>Nintendo enjoyed enormous success in the film department with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned more than $1.3 billion worldwide. Now, Nintendo is gearing up to release The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in 2026, with a live-action The Legend of Zelda film to follow in 2027. More films based on Nintendo properties <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">could come next</a>, and Nintendo has now said moviemaking is something Nintendo wants to be "even more actively involved in going forward."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a> that Nintendo is keen to pursue moviemaking because it believes films can become long-term assets for the company as it looks to the future beyond games.</p><p>Nintendo has an internal unit called Nintendo Pictures, which is conducting experiments in the video space, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">recent Pikmin shorts</a>. But Nintendo Pictures won't be the team that handles future feature films--that work is being done by established Hollywood studios like Universal and Illumination.</p><p>"For movies, there is an established business framework where the distribution companies manage movies. The past indicates that following that established structure and creating content with care and attention leads to profits," Furukawa said.</p><p>Hollywood is an established machine with a "proven business model," Furukawa said, but Nintendo Pictures is a new unit trying to "take on various challenges in areas that have not yet clearly taken shape."</p><p>"The 'Close to You' Pikmin-themed short video that was released recently was created as an experiment based on this concept. We would like to continue providing this kind of content that generates enthusiasm around the world, and develop it into an important asset for Nintendo," Furukawa said.</p><p>No more Nintendo movies beyond the live-action Zelda film have been announced, but there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">rumors of a Donkey Kong film.</a></p><p>Nintendo also recently discussed its general philosophy for filmmaking recently. The company said it doesn't simply license its properties to film studios. Instead, Nintendo is involved in the financing and "deeply involved" in production. Shigeru Miyamoto, for example, produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will be a producer on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and the Zelda movie, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-from-sony-and-nintendo-is-now-filming-apparently/1100-6535988/" data-ref-id="1100-6535988">just began filming in New Zealand. </a></p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie made a gargantuan $1.36 billon at the global box office, ranking as the No. 2 highest-grossing movie of 2023, only behind Barbie ($1.44 billion). The Super Mario Bros. Movie ranks as the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 18 highest-grossing movie in history.</a></p><p>"It was enjoyed by a vast audience, including those who had experienced Mario games, those less familiar with gaming, and people of all ages, from children to seniors," Nintendo said. "What has pleased us most about this film, even more than the measurable results, are the warm comments we received from so many people."</p><p>Nintendo's gaming business is booming at the moment, thanks in part to the recent launch of the Switch 2. It's sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">more than 10 million units thus far</a>, becoming Nintendo's fastest-selling platform ever. Nintendo is enthusiastic about its sales potential this holiday, recently boosting the console's sales projections from 15 million to 19 million for the fiscal year that ends in March 2026.</p>

                <p>Whenever a new mainline Pokemon game rolls around, you can expect not one but two versions of the same game to hit the shelves. That's a sales decision that was made with a primary goal in mind--to give Nintendo's iconic plumber Mario a run for his money.</p><p>During an investor Q&amp;A this week, Nintendo veteran Shigeru Miyamoto spoke about a meeting he once had with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri, who joked that the only way to beat Mario Kart in sales was to sell two copies of Pokemon to each consumer. Miyamoto says this was one of the reasons why the first Pokemon game was released as Pokemon Blue and Pokemon Red, which is a tradition that was continued since then with most mainline games.</p><p>"That is one reason why Pokémon started with both Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Miyamoto said</a>. "I believe that new ideas are born precisely because of people like him, who challenge themselves to surpass what came before."</p><p>These Pokemon games typically offer exclusive Pokemon for players to collect, and as of Pokemon Silver and Gold, two distinct legendary Pokemon that can only be found in their respective games. Of course, trading Pokemon is a big part of the experience as well, and recent games have made the process of completing your Pokedex easier thanks to advances in online connectivity. There are still fans who are completionists at heart and will buy both versions of a Pokemon game, with Nintendo even selling two-packs to cater to player demand.</p><p>This year marked the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, and while a new Generation 10 game wasn't released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet did get a Switch 2 upgrade</a> that greatly improved the game on the new Nintendo hardware. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was also released</a>, and it saw players return to Lumiose City for the first time since Pokemon X and Y on the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In the business department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Nintendo has reported that it has sold 10.36 million Switch 2</a> units as of September 30, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Mario Kart World has sold 9.57 million units so far</a>. The company also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-vast-majority-of-nintendo-switch-2-owners-transitioned-from-switch-1/1100-6535947/">84% of Switch 2 owners previously owned a Switch 1 console</a>, and while it'll still sell the older console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-will-not-be-removed-from-sale-but-nintendo-will-focus-on-switch-2-going-forward/1100-6535968/">Nintendo will focus on the Switch 2 going forward</a>.</p>
