                <p>One of the most annoying parts of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> endgame may soon see changes, as Blizzard has said it's looking to "fix" boss fight immunity phases.</p><p dir="ltr">In a response to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-boss-immunity-phases-might-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past-377626?utm_source=bsky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=250807&amp;utm_content=d4_immunity" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>) asking for Blizzard to remove the immunity phases from endgame bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and the Harbinger of Hatred, Diablo director of content and social marketing Adam Fletcher had a short-and-to-the-point answer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">There are plans to fix this up.</p>  â€” Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"There are plans to fix this up," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">Long immunity phases where bosses become invulnerable are currently a pain point in Diablo 4's endgame post-Season 8, which made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">bosses harder but also more rewarding</a>. Even though a player may be capable of dealing enough damage to kill a Tormented boss in just a few blows, there are instead multiple periods where players are forced to endure various mechanics while the boss becomes invincible for a set amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The immunity phases are especially annoying (and have been basically since the game's launch) for the Echo of Lilith boss fight due to her attacks causing a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players. Add on the fact that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-players-are-fed-up-with-its-bugged-lilith-boss-fight/1100-6532596/" data-ref-id="1100-6532596">Lilith fight has been bugged</a> recently so that she sometimes never leaves her invulnerability phase, and players are largely fed up with having to wait to deal damage despite being strong enough to kill bosses outright.</p><p dir="ltr">What specific changes to Diablo 4's endgame bosses, or when they may arrive, are still a mystery, as Fletcher didn't elaborate further. However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon. In addition to changes for Diablo 4, Blizzard has also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Diablo 2 news</a>, which fans are hoping is new content for the classic ARPG.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 launched July 1, and it hasn't taken long for players to discover an infinite-damage bug for the Sorcerer class that is trivializing the ARPG's hardest content. Even worse, it's not hard to replicate.</p><p dir="ltr">As broken down by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mekuna</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/infinite-damage-strikes-again-as-diablo-4-players-overthrow-the-tyranny-of-mathematics-with-an-exploit-that-grants-sorcerers-the-power-of-the-gods-no-way-that-they-leave-that-in-the-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), the bug revolves around the Sorcerer's Enlightenment Key Passive, which can be activated by casting skills of a different element to generate Enlightenment stacks. At 100 stacks, the Sorcerer becomes Enlightened and benefits from increased damage, mana regeneration, and attack speed for a limited time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c6FLFrumkg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's simple enough, but the passive is currently interacting with a new seasonal power, Smoldering Embers, that for some reason causes the damage bonus from Enlightenment to go through the roof when entering portals to a new area. By proccing Enlightenment right before going to a portal, the Sorcerer's elemental damage multipliers start to go up exponentially, with Mekuna's video showing how at one point, after going through several portals using the bug, his Sorcerer had plus 581,000,000,000% more Lightning damage.</p><p dir="ltr">With such absurd numbers, any enemy in Diablo 4 becomes child's play. Pit 150, the current hardest challenge in Diablo 4, can be cleared in under a minute, as everything instantly melts around a Sorcerer taking advantage of the bug.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hopefully that's going to be fixed quickly," Mekuna said in his video explaining the bugged build. "We don't need that in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days ago, players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6SW_yOZIg&amp;t=217s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> another bugged Sorcerer build that also took advantage of the interaction between Enlightenment and Smoldering Embers. That build, however, was much more difficult to replicate, as it required cycling Enlightenment with another modifier that, while possible, required far more precision.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of the bugged build doesn't require any careful stacking of modifiers and is so easy that basically anyone can do it. For that reason it's almost certainly now on Blizzard's radar, but there hasn't been any official word on when a fix might be coming, though one would hope it's soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to run until September 23. In addition to letting players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, Season 9 brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to the game's Nightmare dungeons</a>. It didn't, however, address the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">unpopular new Reliquary battle pass system</a>.</p>
