                <p dir="ltr">From the first trailer, I knew Neva would be an emotional experience. Nomada Studio's previous game, Gris, was a poignant exploration of grief and the effects it can have on a person, told through the lens of a young girl who'd just lost her mother. Neva explores familial bonds through a different but just as emotional lens: parenthood.</p><p dir="ltr">The relationship between Alba and Neva mirrors a mother/child relationship through most of the game. The wolf starts as a small cub, curious about the world and ready to explore, and eventually he becomes a strong protector, equaling his mother's capabilities. From there, the two fight against the blight that's affecting the world, with Neva learning new abilities in every season.</p><p dir="ltr">The journey encompassing this coming of age includes some of the strongest voice acting you'll find in a video game this year. However, unlike games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio, which are bursting with dialogue, Neva accomplishes this feat with a much smaller script; throughout the entire five-hour adventure, only one word is ever spoken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415496"></a><figcaption>One of many gorgeous scenes throughout Neva.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415496-neva-best-of-2024.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neva's control scheme is standard fare for an action-platformer: one button to attack, one button to jump, one button to dodge, etc. Included in the control scheme, though, is a button specifically designated for calling Neva. No matter what you're doing, or where you are, a simple press will make Alba say "Neva" and call out for the good wolfie girl.</p><p dir="ltr">While the mechanic has its uses--you can call Neva to your side if she's far away, or instruct her to jump up a ledge--it's mostly just there for the player's enjoyment. Calling Neva usually results in Alba giving her companion a little scratch behind the ears--which means yes, in Neva, you can pet the dog.</p><p dir="ltr">Its biggest contribution to the story, and what sends Neva into the upper echelon of 2024 voice acting, is the emotion Alba conveys whenever the button is pressed. When there's little danger around, and Neva is sniffing around or standing still, Alba's voice is calm, loving, and light. The character's love for her companion comes through, especially when it's followed by sounds of delight from both characters following a loving head scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">Press that button in a more urgent moment, however, and Alba's voice becomes <em>much </em>heavier. There's urgency in her calls, permeated by a sense of panic. Her anxiety and fear come to the surface, and all it takes is a change in inflection. It's powerful stuff, and it makes using the call button more than worth it even in hectic situations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415498"></a><figcaption>Neva is trapped, and Alba fights to free her companion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415498-neva-best-of-2024-2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's one moment in particular that really highlights how effective this voice acting can be. Alba and Neva are separated, and the player as Alba must traverse a perilous maze in order to reunite with the wolf. Throughout this endeavor, pressing the call button makes Alba utter a cry of pure terror, helplessly shouting into the void in search of her lost companion. The fear of the unknown is palpable, and I start to feel Alba's anxiety with her as I hear her call the wolf's name.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, putting Alba's ability to call out for Neva on a button is not without its pitfalls. By doing this, Nomada ran the risk of some players not being able to hear the exceptional voice work at hand, simply because they were so focused on the action on screen that they were too busy attacking and dodging to press the call button.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Nomada brilliantly trained us to keep it in the back of our minds through the mechanic I mentioned earlier: the one where Alba uses her call to summon Neva to her side. The player now knows that calling Neva can summon her, so once the two are separated, it's natural to press the button and see if it works--and when it doesn't, to keep trying it in the hopes that maybe it will work eventually.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who's ever been in care of a child and lost sight of them--be it in a store, a theme park, or even in their own homes--can relate to this feeling of paralyzing fear, uncertainty, and doubt… as well as the feeling of sheer relief when Alba finds Neva happily sitting on a platform, not a care in the world, as if nothing happened. Kids these days!</p><p dir="ltr">Neva is a profound analysis of parenthood, and all of the highs and lows that come with it. The raw emotion is best conveyed through its voice acting, credited to Cristina Peña, and putting Alba's voice under the player's control makes it that much more effective. Nomada Studio deserves a ton of credit for finding a way to convey the intricate complexities of being a caregiver--and even more credit for doing it with a single word.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

                <p>These days, it seems like every protagonist is edgy and serious--with maybe the exception of cartoon mascots--across movies, games, TV, and wherever else you can imagine. Leave it to the Like a Dragon game series, which is essentially a playable Japanese-crime soap opera when you get down to it, to rethink that idea. Ichiban Kasuga is a refreshing, powerful antithesis to that, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth put his optimistic, unironic outlook on the world to the test--one he passes with flying colors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: We'll be discussing some spoilers from very early and very late in the game. This picture of Ichiban is your chance to back out now.</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like a Dragon: Yakuza introduced us to Ichiban for the first time. As a longtime fan of the series, I was initially suspicious. I wondered, who's this guy? Who's this goofy-looking dork with hair like he bit down too hard on a live wire?</p><p dir="ltr">He quickly won me and many other Yakuza fans over quickly with his enthusiasm and seemingly bottomless well of optimism that he can pull from whenever he or someone he cares about seems to be cornered.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, though, that really cemented him as the new protagonist of this series. Sure, Like a Dragon: Yakuza had its share of drama, but Infinite Wealth put him through the wringer. He meets his first party member, Tomizawa, when Tomizawa takes him to a back alley of Honolulu to scam him. Then he meets his second, Chitose, when she drugs him and leaves him naked on a public beach (with only the most rudimentary command of English, too). After those early-game betrayals, he goes through bunches more, including the discovery that one of his warmest recent friendships was a ruse by the person who engineered Ichiban being fired from his job in disgrace.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the final moments of the game, though, Ichiban tracks that man down and convinces him to turn himself in to the cops. Ichiban carries the guy through Kamurocho to the police station, even as people huck trash at them the whole way.</p><p dir="ltr">The game opens on Ichiban trying to help ex-yakuza find legitimate jobs, and ends with him trying to rehabilitate someone who literally tried to destroy every bit of his life, and even those of his friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu will always be my favorite protagonist, but the way Ichiban plays reflects the difference in their approaches. Kiryu is kind of a time traveler, acting like the yakuza depicted in old crime movies. His missions are often about helping people, but they're often framed more like life lessons. For Ichiban, though, every chance to help someone is like a chance to cannonball off a diving board; he rushes into it against his own best interests and is immediately all-in. He trusts first and forgives quickly. It makes him seem naive at times, as we see in the opening hours of the game. But what it becomes is a rallying point for everyone around him. He's naive, yes, but he's also confident, brave, and reliable, and it's a virus that begins to infect all of the people around him who had been pushed out of society in different way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Throughout Infinite Wealth, you build relationships with each of your party members, and when you stop by the watering hole they all chill at after a hard day of questing, you have the chance to take that relationship to the next level (no, not like that) by listening to them vent about their own rough histories, and then helping them overcome them.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu spends games trying to honorably isolate himself from everyone he knows and loves, seeing his presence as a curse on their lives--that the drama coming around them is entirely his fault. Ichiban is the opposite, though, as he works overtime to unite everyone around him.</p><p dir="ltr">So many games put you in the shoes of grimdark or tortured people--Alan Wake, Spider-Man 2's version of Peter Parker, Space Marine 2's Captain Titus, FFVII's Cloud, James Sunderland of Silent Hill 2, to name a few recent examples. Some of my favorite game characters are among that list, but even so, Ichiban continues to stand out as special in modern gaming: a video game hero who's excited to be there, ready to get a team together, and take on all challengers without ever coming across as trite, false, or annoying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
