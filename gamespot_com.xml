                <p>A streamer who found himself in the legal crosshairs of Nintendo has been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages to the company. Nintendo sued Jesse "EveryGameGuru" Keighin in 2024, accusing him of livestreaming pirated games before they were released and for sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators.</p><p>Keighin had gone on the offensive after he was accused, telling Nintendo that "you might run a corporation, but I run the streets," on his social media channels (via <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/" rel="nofollow ">TorrentFreak</a>). The lawsuit accused Keighin of streaming leaked Nintendo games since 2022, and Nintendo claimed that his actions had cost the company "millions of dollars" in lost video game sales. Keighin reportedly did not have a prepared defense for the case, leading to a default judgment against him.</p><p>Nintendo had also requested a broad permanent injunction against Keighin and any third parties working with him to prevent them from using emulators--as well as the destruction of "all infringing" hardware and software--but the Colorado court did not agree to this request, rejecting it as "unclear" and "unreasonable" demands.</p><p>Known for being notoriously litigious when it comes to protecting its IP, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo also sued James Williams</a> recently, who moderated a Reddit page that promoted Switch piracy. Nintendo is demanding $4.5 million from Williams, accusing him of running several Switch piracy sites and selling pirated Switch games. Last year, Nintendo was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/">successful in shutting down Switch and 3DS emulators</a>, and it is currently involved in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/">legal battle against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p>
