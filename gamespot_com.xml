                <p dir="ltr">At the end of 2022, an unknown number of online leagues in Madden 23 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/">deleted overnight</a> due to what EA called a "data-storage issue that resulted in Franchise files being corrupted." Some players who were affected eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-restores-a-limited-number-of-madden-cloud-franchises-others-lost-for-good/1100-6510742/">got their leagues back</a>, while others never did. The total number of affected players or leagues was never revealed, but it wasn't an especially rare event, as the game's subreddit, EA Forums, and various Discord servers were flooded with players decrying their leagues' disappearances. Now, in Madden 26, something similar seems to be happening.</p><p dir="ltr">It hasn't occurred in one fell swoop, and a different--possibly more hopeful--error message is greeting affected players, but it's unclear why it's happening or if affected leagues can be salvaged.</p><p dir="ltr">The error message some players are getting reads, "Error: The requested league is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience. You have been returned to the Franchise launcher."</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, this is the message players may see if they try to access their league while a patch is being rolled out. But in this case, some players have been stuck staring at this message for weeks. One player in my league said his other league has been inaccessible for a month and a half. Yesterday, our 32-player league was hit with the same bug. We're now tentatively structuring our Plan B in case we need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of forum threads in which players are worried about their leagues having become permanently unavailable, like <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/re-franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12680427" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12702061" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-franchise-is-temporarily-unavailable/12646488" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. In fact, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/category/madden-nfl-26-en/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en" rel="nofollow">browsing by Franchise-related posts turns up many similar threads</a>. Naturally, the same is happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1o29f5l/madden_franchise_error/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234"></a><figcaption>Madden leagues are locking players out without apparent rhyme or reason.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if the issue is happening more recently, but it's definitely affecting different leagues at different times, rather than hitting a number of leagues all at once like in 2022. Some players have reported that their leagues came back to life after a few days, while others have given up after weeks of waiting. On the EA Forums, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-league-error/12635493/replies/12725728" rel="nofollow">community manager provided an update yesterday</a>, saying, "Apologies for the late reply on this one. We have notified the team that this has been happening with the leagues, and they are currently investigating this. Once we have more info on these or need any further information, we will update this thread."</p><p dir="ltr">This latest Franchise lockout doesn't seem to be occurring for the same reasons as when it happened in late 2022, but for affected players, the result is the same: A great deal of investment, sometimes hundreds of hours, is getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted EA for comment on this issue and will update this story if the publisher responds.</p>

                <p>In Battlefield lore, a Rendezook is a legendary maneuver that dates back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a>. It's become so ubiquitous with the series that DICE included a Rendezook in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-trailer-references-the-rendezook-feat-and-one-of-the-creators-is-stoked/1100-6492598/" data-ref-id="1100-6492598">the Battlefield 2042 announcement trailer</a>.

It would be an impossible stunt to pull off in real life, but a player who goes by Stun_Gravy discovered it was possible in Battlefield 3 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a video to prove it</a>.</p><p>The word Rendezook is the combination of rendezvous and bazooka, and it's become such a popular term that it earned an entr√©e in the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rendezook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a>.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is officially out today for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

                <p>EA's long-awaited and heavily hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> is finally out now, and it's off to a hot start on Steam. Within the game's first 30 minutes of public availability, it exceeded 500,000 concurrent users, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Steam's own data.</a> The free games Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are the only two games rank higher than Battlefield 6 currently.</p><p>At press time, Battlefield 6 stands at more than 606,000 concurrent players on Steam.</p><p>A massive launch for Battlefield 6 was expected. One analyst said the game reached nearly 2 million preorders, generating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">more than $100 million in revenue prior to launch.</a> In the time it took to write this post, Battlefield 6 added more than 100,000 more players on Steam.</p><p>GameSpot will continue to update this post as Battlefield 6's player numbers inevitably grow today and this weekend. In the US, it's a long weekend with a holiday on Monday.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is, of course, also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. However, the platform-holders do not share up-to-the-minute player data like Valve does with Steam.</p><p>So far, the Battlefield 6 servers appear to be holding up against the influx of players. Players are being placed into server queues to help mitigate the demand.

                <p>Once Battlefield 6 players start digging into user-created Portal content, they'll find that someone already made a familiar map from Battlefield's biggest competitor.</p><p>As Portal tools were already available a day before the release of Battlefield 6 itself, creator DANNYonPC took it upon himself to recreate Call of Duty's Shipment map using the Portal editor. In a YouTube video, the creator specified that this version of Shipment is based on the iteration seen in the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot, which added some extra routes on higher ground.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZvmYdnQ_d0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZvmYdnQ_d0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>First appearing in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shipment has brought its simple layout and unique brand of chaos to several titles, only rivaled by Nuketown in number of reappearances.</p><p>Shipment is a sensible first project to make in a map editor, given the map's tight quarters. Its small space almost always leads to frantic and explosive encounters where it's hard to last even a full minute before being gunned down or blown up. Arguably, Shipment is the antithesis of Battlefield's gameplay, which is more focused on large-scale encounters in a wide area.</p><p>With this creator revealing the map before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">Battlefield 6 went live</a>, there was no actual gameplay footage in this Battlefield-ized Shipment, but people were already joking about it on social media, with user <a href="https://x.com/BrokenMachine/status/1976427319356203379" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BrokenMachine</a> on X remarking: "We got Shipment in Battlefield 6 before GTA 6."</p><p>And that isn't all that happened to the game pre-launch--according to a report, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">Battlefield 6 already made $100 million</a> in revenue from pre-sales alone.
