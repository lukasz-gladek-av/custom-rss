Unlike other animals, they are easily spooked by your presence and will run away if they see you coming too aggressively. As such, this can make taming a cat a tricky endeavor. However, as long as you follow the steps below, you'll have a tamed cat in no time:</p><ul><li>First, you need to find a cat, which most commonly spawn in villages. Once you find a cat, approach them extremely carefully. Any sudden movements and the cat will run away. You also want to ensure you're crouching.</li><li>While you're approaching the cat slowly, have a raw cod or raw salmon in your hand. This makes the cat less likely to run away.</li><li>After you're close enough to the cat, feed the raw cod or salmon to it. This will successfully tame the cat, making them follow you around.</li><li>You can feed the cat another raw cod or raw salmon to make them enter love mode. If the cat is near another tamed cat, they will breed.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259"></a><figcaption>Taming two cats in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png"></figure><p>The hardest part about taming a cat is getting close enough to them to feed them the raw fish.

As you might expect, you can find a majority of the frogs in Minecraft in the swamp biomes. To see how to breed them once you get there, look at the steps below:</p><ul><li>Approach any frog while holding a slimeball. A frog will follow a player holding a slimeball when they are six blocks or closer.</li><li>Find two frogs, get them to follow you while holding a slimeball, and then feed each frog a slimeball.</li><li>This causes the frogs to enter love mode and eventually, one of the frogs will become pregnant.</li><li>The pregnant frog then looks for a water source with air above it.

The process is similar to the breeding of frogs, but turtles can take much longer to lay their eggs.</p><ul><li>To breed turtles, find a beach during the day. You can usually find turtles swimming near the coast.</li><li>When you find two turtles, feed each of them some seagrass. This causes them to enter love mode.</li><li>One of the turtles in love mode will spawn eggs in its inventory and slightly grow in size.</li><li>After the eggs appear in the turtle's inventory, they will go back to where they first spawned.</li><li>The turtle tries to find a patch of sand to lay its eggs. You'll know the turtle has found their spot when they start rotating 360 degrees.</li><li>After a while, the turtle will lay anywhere from one to four eggs.</li><li>Turtle eggs take four to five in-game days to hatch in Minecraft.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264"></a><figcaption>A turtle with its eggs in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png"></figure><p>The turtle breeding process will take some time, but after it's all said and done, you'll be left with one to four baby turtles.</p><h2 id="How_to_tame_a_Parrot_in_Minecraft">How to tame a Parrot in Minecraft</h2><p>Parrots are rare animals to find in Minecraft, but luckily, they can be tamed rather easily. This means once you find one parrot, you won't be able to get rid of them after the taming process is complete.</p><ul><li>Parrots most commonly spawn in jungle biomes. Once you find one, you can tame them by feeding them any of the following seeds:  <ul><li>Wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds.</li></ul></li><li>This doesn't guarantee you tame the parrot, however. You have a 1/10 chance to tame the parrot every time you feed them a seed.</li><li>You'll know when you tame them after the hearts appear on the parrot after feeding them a seed.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375265-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.20.40.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375265" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375265-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.20.40.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375265"></a><figcaption>Taming a parrot in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375265-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.20.40.82.png"></figure><p>Once a parrot has been tamed, they will follow you around and can even perch on your shoulder.

The Ryzen 5 CPU is a mid-range processor, whereas the GPU and RAM are entry-level components best suited for less graphically intensive games. Many indie games and older AAA titles should work just fine, but don't expect great performance with newer AAA hits like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. We mention Black Ops specifically, because it's featured in the product images for this laptop.</p><p dir="ltr">We've seen similar HP Victus gaming laptops go on sale for around $500-$550 during big sales events like Prime Day, but it's very rare to see an entry-level gaming laptop for <em>this </em>low of a price.</p><p dir="ltr">This HP Victus gaming laptop discount is not the only early Black Friday Door Buster deal.

                <p>Starting today, Hello Games is rolling out cross-save compatibility to a select number of No Man's Sky players. While not everyone will have access immediately, all players can now link their different accounts on the No Man's Sky <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cross-save website</a>. Hello Games says that all players will be able to do the same in "the coming weeks."</p><p>It's a pretty straightforward process to get started. Players simply sign in to a platform account--PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, GOG, with Nintendo Switch Online coming soon--using the links provided and follow the instructions to connect any accounts they have on other devices. Then simply launch No Man's Sky on one of the connected platforms. It should be noted that the players' most recent save will automatically be uploaded to the server, and made available for download on your other connected platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBlz6kcdAS0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XBlz6kcdAS0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players only need to connect a single account, this allows the ability to transfer saves between a PS4 and a PS5, for example, if you're logged into the same PSN account. The feature only allows for five cross-saves.</p><p>The update also sees Mass Effect's iconic Normandy ship coinciding with the launch of N7 Day, which celebrates the Mass Effect series. A new limited-time expedition starts today, with the chance to add the cruiser to your fleet if you can complete it in time. This event will only be around for the next two weeks, so players should hurry and head to the stars if they missed out the first time.</p>
