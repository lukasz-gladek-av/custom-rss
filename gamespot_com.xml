What's intriguing, however, was how the developer discussed how many people might be able to team up in the game.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size," van Semmertier responded. "But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of co-op players."</p><p dir="ltr">Co-op wasn't the only topic broached by Larian on Reddit. CEO Swen Vincke waded right in regarding the lightning-rod issue of generative AI, stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-draws-harder-line-on-ai-clarifies-stance-in-reddit-ama/1100-6537296/">Divinity wouldn't feature "any GenAI art."</a> Larian might still use forms of AI during development, but that will be trained on previous work by the team, according to Vincke. This comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/">backlash to comments Vincke made last month about generative AI at Larian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/">Divinity was unveiled at The Game Awards</a> last month, after a mysterious monolith teased the game beforehand. This is the next big game from the Baldur's Gate 3 creators, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/">Vincke admits there's "more pressure"</a> now. That said, Vincke still believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/">Divinity will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts." </a></p><p>There is no release window for Divinity, but it probably will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/">an early-access game like Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> have been named in a new lawsuit filed in San Francisco by a Louisiana mother who's alleging her child may have experienced structural brain changes due to prolonged exposure to online games.</p><p>Descheca Jackson <a href="https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/20251230_JacksonLawsuit.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims in the lawsuit</a> brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of California on December 30 that her child, a minor only identified by the initials "MA," has developed symptoms consistent with internet gaming disorder (IGD) since playing video games at a young age. This includes behavioral challenges such as her loss of impulse control, withdrawal symptoms, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty disengaging from gameplay. The lawsuit also alleges that MA suffered addiction, social isolation, depression, loss of friends and relationships, and damage to her grades, leading to "an academic dismissal from school."</p><p>According to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.70195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a February 2025 study</a> reported on by <a href="https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/roblox-lawsuit/internet-gaming-disorder-1-in-10-adolescent-boys/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">About Lawsuits</a>, IGD is described as a pattern in which gaming negatively impacts a person's daily activities, including school, work, relationships, and family life. The symptoms tend to include nonstop gaming, irritability when access to games is restricted, and continued use despite its negative consequences. The research suggests IGD affects one in 10 adolescent boys, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and Roblox often the culprits of the disorder.</p><p>Jackson alleges that MA played games like Fortnite and Roblox for years (primarily on Xbox consoles), resulting in a compulsive gaming behavior largely driven by reward-based features designed to exploit the dopamine pathways of a young brain that's still growing. Citing neuroimaging studies linked to IGD, Jackson claims that MA's developing brain has undergone similar structural changes in her prefrontal cortex, the region of the cerebrum responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and reward processing.</p><p>While the lawsuit states that the plaintiffs--Jackson and MA--knew of the effects that prolonged exposure to online gaming can have on adolescent brains, the filing still alleges that MA, as a minor, lacked the legal knowledge and understanding to agree to the terms and conditions within the agreements found in those very games. As such, the complaint claims that those contracts are invalid and unenforceable, specifically because games like these are designed to maximize engagement and screen time through systems like in-game currencies, progression loops, social-pressure mechanisms (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18534431/fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remember the "default skin" debacle</a>?), limited-time events, and reward schedules.</p><p>"MA never agreed to be harmed or exposed to an addictive Product," according to the lawsuit. "Neither Plaintiff nor MA ever entered into a contract with any of the Defendants, and/or to the extent that any Defendant claims MA attempted to accept an electronic terms and conditions clause by clicking buttons on a screen which included language Plaintiff did not understand, read, or language which was conscionable, and has been made void by virtue of its unconscionability and the power of disaffirmance. This unconscionability and disaffirmance is demonstrated and secured by the filing of this Complaint."</p><p>Raising issues around negligence, design defects, failure to warn, and fraud, the lawsuit seeks general and punitive damages--as well as injunctive relief--for 10 counts.</p>

                <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">participated in an AMA on Reddit</a> to set expectations for the studio’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/">upcoming Divinity game</a>, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: "There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity."</p><p>His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets</a> during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later.</p><p>In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing</a>. To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5lWeGhq2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kz5lWeGhq2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We've decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept-art development. That way, there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," Vinke replied. "Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better, in general, the gameplay is. We think GenAI can help with this, and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game."</p><p>Vinke did note that the creative assets will not be generated from outside. If an AI model is used to create something, it will be trained on data or art that Larian itself owns.</p><p>Fans weren't done there, though: A follow-up question asked whether the no-AI stance applied only to concept-art, or if it extended to other creative areas such as writing. They also pointed out previous mentions of using AI for placeholder text and wondered whether such use could undesirably influence final content. Larian's writing director, Adam Smith, responded: "The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries, or other writing in Divinity."</p><p>Smith went further in explaining that using AI to generate placeholder text offered no real benefit after working with a model. "We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best, and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts--and there are a lot of them--are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous."</p><p>Earlier last year, in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a>, Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do," doubling down on using it only for quickening the workflow. There is no release date yet for Divinity, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/"> Larian</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/" data-ref-id="1100-6537029"> is feeling the pressure</a> on how to follow up on the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment seem to be feeling pretty good about the development of Tom Clancy's The Division 3. Julian Gerighty, who oversees the franchise as executive producer, says the game is "shaping up to be a monster."</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">interview at the New Game+ Showcase</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-says-producer/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Gerighty opened up just a bit about the next major installment in the online action-RPG series. "The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced," Gerighty said. "It’s shaping up to be a monster."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GE_C1ueUnss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In 2023, Ubisoft officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/">announced that The Division 3 was in development</a>, so of course Gerighty is correct that it's not a confidential matter at this point. "Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have as big an impact as Division 1 was," Gerighty added.</p><p dir="ltr">A few months ago, Massive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/">dispelled rumors that Gerighty had left Ubisoft altogether</a>. Not only is Gerighty working on The Division 3, but he's also helping with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-survivors-announced-ubisoft-says-its-your-baby/1100-6534215/">The Division 2: Survivors and The Division: Resurgence for mobile platforms</a>. This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Division franchise, too.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release window for The Division 3 at this time. It wasn't the only big-name game discussed at the New Game+ Showcase, either, as Microsoft and developer Obsidian Entertainment revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-rpg-avowed-is-coming-to-ps5-with-new-features/1100-6537287/">Avowed will arrive on PS5 on February 17</a> at the event.</p>
