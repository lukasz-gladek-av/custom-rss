                <p>According to a new report, Ubisoft's family founders are trying to find funding to keep the company in good financial standing while simultaneously attempting to keep control of the firm's future.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reports that the Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--is talking to Tencent and other financial partners to try to find a way to fund a "management-led buyout."</p><p>CEO Yves Guillemot and his family members are keen to retain control of Ubisoft amid any such deal, and this has apparently been a sticking point in financing discussions. The report said Tencent is asking for a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for putting more money into Ubisoft. The report also said Tencent may not invest any further amount of money into Ubisoft.</p><p>The report went on to say Tencent wants to make a deal to help prevent any other firm from coming in to make a hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft. In 2017, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vivendi-will-reportedly-pursue-a-ubisoft-takeover-/1100-6449572/" data-ref-id="1100-6449572">Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover of Ubisoft</a>. The French gaming giant successfully fought this off after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-safe-following-takeover-concerns-vivend/1100-6457541/" data-ref-id="1100-6457541">striking deals with Tencent and a Canadian pension plan.</a></p><p>Tencent currently holds nearly 10% of Ubisoft stock. The Guillemot family owns 15%.</p><p>"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders," Ubisoft said in a statement to Reuters. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p>Earlier this week, Guillemot released a memo to staff that alluded to ongoing business talks about the company's future. In announcing XDefiant's shutdown and the closure of multiple studios resulting in hundreds of layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-still-dedicated-to-live-service-after-its-call-of-duty-competitor-came-up-short/1100-6528215/" data-ref-id="1100-6528215">Guillemot said</a>, "I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny."</p><p>This latest development follows on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a story in October</a> that claimed Ubisoft and Tencent were talking about multiple options, including a total buyout. At the time, Ubisoft acknowledged that discussions were underway as the company looked to find a deal that would appease shareholders. That report said it was early days for any such talks, and this new report doesn't mention anything being close to a done deal.</p><p>Minority shareholder and hedge fund AJ Investments published an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">open letter</a> in September asking Ubisoft to go private and change its strategy.</p><p>In September, Ubisoft's shares sunk to their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">lowest since 2015</a>, falling by 12.6% after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws released</a> to lower-than-expected sales. Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> from November 15 to February 14, 2025, taking the feedback it learned from the release of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Ubisoft's share price surged by as much as 16% today, December 6, in the wake of the Reuters report, but remains down more than 70% over the past five years.</p>

                <p>The world of The Witcher is full of monsters, madmen, and mages, but when Geralt isn't on the trail of any of those, the man knows how to wind down with a game of Gwent. The two-player card game has the players as generals pitting their armies against each other. There's been a Gwent mobile app and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284410/GWENT_The_Witcher_Card_Game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free-to-play version on Steam</a>, but now a physical reproduction of the game is on its way.</p><p>Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games--which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming--are collaborating on the release. The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to give players that authentic Witcher 3 experience. There will be variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p><p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said the marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK, Rob Trounce (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-card-game-gwent-finally-getting-a-physical-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package--whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p><p>The rules are simple enough, but the path to victory has several routes, all depending on your deck, which has its own set of advantages. There are four decks to choose from: Monsters, Nilfgaardian Empire, Northern Realms, and Scoia'tael. A fifth deck--Skellige--was added with The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion. There are also neutral cards that, while not a deck in itself, can be used with any of the main decks to boost their abilities.</p><p>Matches are won by two out of three rounds, which are tallied by red gems in the game. Losing a round loses you one of the points, and if you lose both, you lose the match. A draw makes both players lose a point unless you are the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose ability is to win matches that end in draws.</p><p>The entire Gwent game set is priced at around $40 and will arrive in late 2025.</p><p>While Witcher fans won't have to wait too long for Gwent, they'll have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bit longer for The Witcher 4</a>. Though the game has reached full-scale production, we're still looking at two years before the release.</p>

                <p>According to PlayStation veteran Chris Deering, Sony was anxious about the original Xbox and that concern prompted the company to sign an exclusivity deal with Take-Two for Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>"We were worried when we saw Xbox coming," Deering recalled at a recent EGX event in London, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields."</p><p>With that concern in mind, Deering said he approached third-party publishers and developers to ask if they would be interested in taking a "special deal" for timed exclusivity for any of their upcoming games. Deering and company didn't realize GTA would become such a massive franchise, but that bet seemed to pay off, as GTA III took the series into a new direction with a 3D open-world approach.</p><p>"One of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto III was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game," Deering said. "It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><p>The original Xbox would go on to launch in November 2001, but GTA III did not show up on Xbox until November 2003. The timed-exclusivity deals extended Vice City and San Andreas.</p><p>While the exclusivity deals ended there--GTA 4 and GTA 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time--Sony did continue to work with Rockstar on special deals. For example, GTA 5 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-grand-theft-auto-v-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/1100-6420294/" data-ref-id="1100-6420294">announced for PS4 at Sony's E3 briefing in 2014</a>. There is no word on if Rockstar has any special relationship with Sony or Microsoft for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, however.</p><p>As for Deering, he left Sony in 2005. He also made headlines recently when he said recent video game industry layoffs were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. Deering was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p>

                <p>The newest Call of Duty weapons have been revealed online, and we are running out of ways to describe how ridiculous and over-the-top the game's guns have become. As announced previously, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are getting numerous new weapons in Season 1 Reloaded, and these include a gun that turns into a bong and a melee weapon that morphs into a rave with a cat as the DJ. Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The "Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft," meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ. Check out the videos below to see these in action, and expect these store bundles to come to Black Ops 6 and Warzone soon.</p><p>These videos emerged from data-miners. When a new Call of Duty season launches, like Season 1 Reloaded did on December 5, people quickly dig through the files to find what's coming next, and that includes these two wacky bundles.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded brings a lot more to Call of Duty than bongs and raves. The update introduces new maps, modes, weapons, events, and all manner of holiday season changes.</p><p>For more on what's coming to Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 1 Reloaded this December, check out the gallery below.</p>
