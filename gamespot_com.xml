According to data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/#3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2's player numbers have been steadily climbing since the start of the sale on January 24, when the game became discounted to just $15. The game's concurrent players peaked at 86,717 on January 26, a bump of more than 10,000 players compared to the same time in 2023 and 2024.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="796289618" data-promo-id="0"

Red Dead Redemption 2 currently sports a 98 on review aggregator Metacritic, and in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west/1900-6417019/" data-ref-id="1900-6417019">Red Dead Redemption 2 review</a>, we called Rockstar's return to the Wild West "a thought-provoking" prequel with a rich, detailed world we didn't want to leave. We even awarded it as GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespots-game-of-the-year-2018/1100-6464009/" data-ref-id="1100-6464009">GameSpot's Game Of The Year 2018</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It was released on PC a year later, and though its launch on the platform was rough at start, subsequent updates solved many of the game's outstanding technical issues.

                <p>There was a point in time when it would have been unthinkable for Xbox-exclusive titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo or Gears of War to ever make the leap to PlayStation 5</a>. But the recent cross-platform push by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer may make those rumors into a reality. Now, Thomas Mahler--the creative director of Moon Studios and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review/1900-6416053/" data-ref-id="1900-6416053">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/1900-6417425/" data-ref-id="1900-6417425">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a>--has endorsed Spencer's approach and suggested that it may be what's best for the video game industry.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883273827284599091" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy post on X</a>, Mahler argued that it no longer makes sense for Xbox and PlayStation consoles to compete when the hardware is so similar and the user base is "stuck attracting the same 100-150 [million] players for over two decades now." He argues that the key to growth is to make it easier for players to get their desired games regardless of which console they buy... with the exception of Nintendo, which doesn't have to play by anyone else's rules. Mahler added that "rooting for one huge corporation to sell more boxes over another strikes me as fantastically senseless... We should all just share in the love for games!"</p><p>For now, Spencer's platform agnostic position has not been adopted by Sony, but Mahler suggested that the PlayStation maker has already bent towards that reality by bringing its exclusive titles to PC, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-ps5-exclusive-hits-pc-in-march/1100-6529029/" data-ref-id="1100-6529029">recently announced Rise of the Ronin port</a>.</p><p>"We'll see how long Sony will keep limiting their software sales to one platform," <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883284453251813472" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote Mahler</a>. "There's a reason why they’re already releasing some games on PC now. It's money. They can probably ignore Xbox for now, since Xbox Series hasn't sold all that well, but that might change if Xbox makes a great console again. If they end up with a better machine than whatever the next PlayStation is and if players adopt that, Sony's platform-exclusive strategy is history."</p><p>Some of the most prominent cross-platform titles that are confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 from Xbox-affiliated studios include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-be-the-end-of-the-series/1100-6529013/" data-ref-id="1100-6529013">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Microsoft also owns Activision, which released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's best-selling game</a> across all consoles in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. The upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">launch of Nintendo's Switch 2</a> may also help the industry grow this year, and Spencer has already pledged that Microsoft will support the new console as well.</p>

                <p>A new trailer for the next EA Originals game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, has gone live and shows off more of the Hazelight-developed game in action. Narrated by game director Josef Fares, the gameplay trailer shows off two levels--one set in a sci-fi world, the other in a fantasy land--and how players will use unique co-op gameplay elements in each one to progress. For the sci-fi level, there are anti-gravity sections and bike chases to look forward to, while the fantasy level features shape-shifting gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlySOphMuo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big feature shown off in the Split Fiction video are Side Stories, optional one-off adventures that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Discovering one and exploring it will transport players to even more worlds influenced by sci-fi and fantasy fiction, with some of the levels including outer space, an Alice in Wonderland-themed world, and a stage that looks heavily influenced by the recent Dune movies.</p><p>Developed by the studio behind the critically acclaimed It Takes Two, Split Fiction was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-only-split-fiction-is-an-impressive-leap-forward-from-the-makers-of-it-takes-two/1100-6528426/">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a>. A mandatory two-player game, Split Fiction lets you play as two would-be writers: Mio and Zoe. After the pair sign up to participate in a new publishing program, they find themselves transported to virtual recreations of their stories by a shady tech company and have to work together to escape before they lose their memories.</p><p>Split Fiction is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on March 6, 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorders-for-it-takes-two-developers-new-game-split-fiction-now-live/1100-6528489/">and preorders are now live for it</a>. The great thing about the game is that it comes with a cross-play Friend Pass, allowing one user to invite a friend to join them even if they haven't purchased Split Fiction.</p><p>Thanks to its cross-play design, it also doesn't matter which of the three applicable platforms your pal is on either, as you'll both be able to team up for a jaunt across futuristic and magical lands. 2025 has quite a few exciting co-op games on the horizon, and if you're interested in seeing what else is coming out in this genre throughout the year, you can check out GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-most-anticipated-co-op-games-of-2025-and-beyond/2900-6144/" data-ref-id="2900-6144">most-anticipated co-op games of the year</a>.</p>

                <p>Sega recently filed trademarks for Skies of Arcadia and Eternal Arcadia, leaving fans hopeful that some sort of remaster or new entry in the Skies of Arcadia RPG series.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sega-trademarks-skies-of-arcadia-eternal-arcadia-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the two trademarks were filed on January 16 and made public on January 24. Skies of Arcadia, known as Eternal Arcadia in Japan, was a critically acclaimed RPG from Sega that launched in 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was later ported over to the Nintendo GameCube in 2002 as Skies of Arcadia Legends.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skies-of-arcadia/" data-ref-id="5000-891">Skies of Arcadia</a> follows Vyse, Aika, and Fina, who are part of a group of air pirates called the Blue Rogues as they resist against the tyrannical Valuan Empire. Additional ports of Skies of Arcadia have been highly requested by fans throughout the years, although Skies of Arcadia Legends has never been released outside of the GameCube.</p><p>Sega has not confirmed anything new regarding Skies of Arcadia. However, Sega has been on an initiative to revive some of its old franchises. Back in 2023, Sega <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">announced new entries</a> in the Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage franchises.</p><p>Sega is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-virtua-fighter-gets-unexpected-first-look-but-its-not-gameplay/1100-6528672/" data-ref-id="1100-6528672">new Virtua Fighter game</a>. Hopefully, now some sort of Skies of Arcadia revival won't be a pie in the sky dream after all.</p>

                <p>A modding group has released a mod that brings GTA: Vice City content into the GTA 4 engine, despite efforts from publisher Take-Two Interactive to stop them. This project by Revolution Team, called GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition, ported missions, cutscenes, and the world from Vice City into GTA 4's engine and initially required players to own a copy of GTA 4.</p><p>The development team said its YouTube channel was taken offline by Take-Two. That led to the creation of a new channel that houses a launch trailer for the mod, as well as a decision to rework the mod's requirement. Originally, the mod required GTA 4 to play--something that was done to "show respect to the publisher." Now, that requirement has been dropped, and the mod can be downloaded and played as a standalone game. As always, though, you should be careful about what you download online.</p><p>"Our team's channel was deleted by Take-Two Interactive two days before the project's release. A lot of time and effort was invested into its development, including hundreds of hours of streaming," Revolution Team's statement reads on an updated teaser trailer.</p><p>"[The teaser] gained over 100,000 views in less than a day. Unfortunately, it's absolutely impossible to restore it. We were forced to create a new channel, but it's unlikely that this trailer will reach the people who were truly waiting for it. Nevertheless, we're sharing the result of almost two years of hard work."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hqwmq6XT6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7hqwmq6XT6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Just last week, a mod known as Liberty City Preservation Project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reportedly-kills-another-gta-fan-project/1100-6528845/" data-ref-id="1100-6528845">was taken down after Rockstar contacted its creators</a>. "This isn't a DMCA, rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive," the Liberty City Preservation Project said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">GTA 6 is still set to release this year</a>. A parody game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parody-game-pulled-from-psn-resurfaces-on-steam/1100-6528952/" data-ref-id="1100-6528952">Grand Taking Ages</a> is also set to launch this year. After initially having its PSN listing removed, the developer said it made changes, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">store page on Steam</a> is now available.</p>
