                <p>8BitDo has officially revealed its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first dedicated mobile controller</a> in the vein of the <a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi V2</a>. The cradle design coupled with the signature features of the manufacturer's stellar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate controllers for PC and Nintendo Switch</a> makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> an eye-catching option, especially since it's priced at only $50. Available to preorder now at Amazon, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> variants starting November 29.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg"></figure><p>Like its high-end controllers, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller features triggers and joysticks with Hall Effect sensors, which prevents stick drift and generally offers a smoother feel. It also has two customizable rear triggers, a dedicated turbo button, and it'll fit any phone between 3.93 inches (100mm) to 6.69 inches (170mm) in length. That covers the vast majority of modern phones. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest phone, is 6.42 inches in length. The controller's design of this looks quite comfortable as well, as it adds a more traditional gaming profile to a phone.</p><p>It also supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, an easy-to-use customization suite that lets you remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and more.</p><p>The main, and fairly substantial, caveat here: It's only confirmed to support Android, but other 8BitDo controllers listed with Android-only mobile support have worked on iOS just fine. GameSpot has reached out to 8BitDo to see if official support for iOS is planned and whether it will work in some capacity with iPhones at launch.</p><p>Since the controller syncs via Bluetooth, not via USB-C like the Backbone, we would be surprised if it didn't support iOS. 8BitDo's other controllers do work with Apple devices via Bluetooth, and its Ultimate Software app is available through the iOS Store.</p><p>If it works at all--and again, we are speculating here--the Ultimate Software app is the key feature that could be missing on iOS. If 8BitDo doesn't or isn't able to add the controller to the list of devices that sync with the app on iOS, iPhone users wouldn't be able to remap inputs or make other adjustments--unless they also have an Android device or the controller is capable of syncing with the PC app to make changes. Remapped inputs and other adjustments are typically saved to the controller, so if you own an Android tablet or an old Android phone with 9.0 firmware or higher, you could theoretically make those changes on that device before using it on iPhone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589" data-ratio="0.6041095890411" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller has two ergonomically designed rear triggers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png"></figure><p>We'll update this article if and when we hear from 8BitDo about iPhone compatibility. Considering Apple has made a push into AAA gaming on iOS with titles such as Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller and its myriad customization features would be a boon for iPhone users.</p><p>Nevertheless, Android users have an exciting new controller option to look forward to. 8BitDo's controllers almost always punch above their price, so the 8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller should be on your radar. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless 2.4GHz Wireless</a> is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a> is our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">favorite third-party controller for Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>At $50, 8BitDo's mobile controller is half the price of the Backbone One, the leading cradle-style mobile controller. Backbone One costs $100 and doesn't have rear triggers or Hall Effect sticks/triggers. It does offer dedicated support for iPhone and Android via USB-C (or Lightning), including a handy app that collects your games in one console-style launcher. The USB-C connection also mitigates latency concerns, whereas Bluetooth can add a bit of latency. 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers typically work great via Bluetooth, but it's worth mentioning here.</p><p><strong>8BitDo:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (White)</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (Black)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p><strong>Backbone One:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_WCopub4HusdMMWHmtP?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2TJW4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lighting, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>In related news, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is also available to preorder</a><span> now for $40 at Amazon.

                <p>In 1997, one of the most-remembered moments from Final Fantasy 7 was the murder of a beloved companion character, which resonated throughout the rest of the game and all of its subsequent follow-up media. Final Fantasy 7's narrative hinges on that moment, and there didn't seem to be any way around it without cheats until now.</p><p><strong>Spoiler warning: If you don't know who dies in this 27-year-old game or don't want to know, stop reading now.</strong></p><p>Aerith Gainsborough meets her end at the hands of Sephiroth, but as related by a Final Fantasy 7 speedrunner who goes by Luzbel, a way to skip past Aerith's death was found by two other players: AceZephyr and Kuma.</p><p>The way to pull it off is more of a glitch than a cheat. When the player is riding a chocobo on the world map, there's nothing that prevents them from walking to the Forgotten Capital, the site of Aeirth's murder. If Aeirth is in the player's party, she'll see her own death and fight alongside the player against Jenova. The downside to this approach is that players won't have a high level during the fight, and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-discovered-final-fantasy-7-glitch-finally-lets-you-save-beloved-character" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the game will "softlock" during cutscenes if Aerith is in the party after the timeframe of her death.</p><p>Aerith's fate was also one of the primary plot points in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> earlier this year, which demonstrates her enduring popularity among fans of the new series. The newly discovered glitch in the original game may spare Aeirth from death, but it's not a perfect solution, and she wasn't really meant to survive.</p>
