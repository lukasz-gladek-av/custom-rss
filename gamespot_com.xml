                <p>Yet another version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> is here, with developer Bethesda Game Studios mega-hit RPG now available for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim continues to conquer every platform imaginable, and this time it's specifically 2021's Skyrim Anniversary Edition that's available on Nintendo's new console. This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support. It also sports improved load times and performance in addition to features found in the original Switch version of Skyrim, like Legend of Zelda Amiibo support, Zelda-themed items, and motion controls.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim truly is the gift that keeps giving for Bethesda, as it's still one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>.

Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date. In November, Bethesda's Todd Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"still a long way off"</a> and that he's "preaching patience" to fans. Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>
