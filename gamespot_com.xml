                <p>AdHoc CEO Michael Choung thinks most studios should avoid episodic releases, a stance he makes clear even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dispatch-review-fantastic-superhero-tv/1900-6418442/" data-ref-id="1900-6418442">Dispatch</a>--the studio’s debut superhero workplace comedy--has become a runaway success. Choung says the weekly-release format that helped Dispatch explode past 1 million sales in 10 days and put it on track to hit its three-year sales target in just three months was difficult at every turn and an actual "insane thing to do."</p><p>Speaking to technology newsletter <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Knowledge</a>, Choung recalled being warned repeatedly that releasing the game week by week instead of all at once was a terrible idea. But the team believed the format was essential for the story. "What's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a video game, all meshing and rubbing up against each other," he said. The narrative had always been structured episodically, even though it went against industry "conventional wisdom."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dispatch Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite internal debate, AdHoc settled on releasing two episodes weekly rather than dropping the game all at once, splitting it into halves, or spacing out individual episodes. The bet paid off dramatically. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered," Choung explained. This kind of schedule created a sense that "the train is leaving the station, but not just yet--I can still make it," which encouraged players to jump in. Contrary to expectations that week-two numbers would fall, concurrent users kept doubling with each release.</p><p>"Those things, we anticipated. I don't think we anticipated the scale of it," he said.</p><p>Still, Choung insists this approach shouldn't become a trend. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!” he said. While AdHoc would be "thrilled" to see others succeed with the model, he stresses that it is grueling and risky.</p><p>Beyond release strategy, AdHoc has also drawn attention for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-studio-weighs-in-on-the-ai-debate-in-gaming/1100-6536310/" data-ref-id="1100-6536310">rejecting AI as a replacement for creative roles.</a> "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," said creative director Nick Herman. "Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative."</p>

                <p>Nintendo enthusiasts believe that an announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> DLC is imminent, though it takes a few steps to reach that conclusion.</p><p>Evidence, fans believe, stems from datamined information from the Nintendo Today app, which shares daily bite-sized pieces of news and offers several themes based on various Nintendo franchises. A new Donkey Kong theme came to the app recently, and per datamines (which you can see on <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Wiki</a>), it looks like the app will highlight a character that had a surprise appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p><em>Spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza to follow!</em></p><p>An intro animation for DK's nemesis, King K. Rool, is purportedly set to feature in the Nintendo Today app on December 15. It'll be the first time Nintendo officially acknowledges his presence in Bananza, since his role was a big plot twist in the game. So, how does that relate to Mario Kart World DLC?</p><p>Back when Mario Kart World launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sharp-eyed players noticed</a> that the Japanese voice performers for K. Rool and Bananza boss Void Kong appeared in the credits, despite their characters not appearing in the kart racer. While it's possible that the two voice actors played different roles in the base game, fans took it as evidence that a Donkey Kong Bananza-themed expansion is coming to Mario Kart World.</p><p>The timing of K. Rool's Nintendo Today animation rolling out a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025 streams</a> on December 11 has fans trying to connect some dots, believing that putting K. Rool in the spotlight would tie in well with a possible DLC announcement at the awards show.</p><p>It isn't the most implausible theory--Nintendo has made announcements at The Game Awards in previous years, and the relatively paltry number of costumes for Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World leaves room for a big DK-centered expansion.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, Mario Kart fans are hungry for more. Despite being the marquee launch title for Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">sales nearly matching those of the console itself</a>, there hasn't been any acknowledgement or hint of post-release content for Mario Kart World. At the very least, Nintendo has continued to update the game, most recently with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-out-now-adds-custom-item-rules-and-more/1100-6536657/" data-ref-id="1100-6536657">big patch that added features</a> like custom item rules.</p>
