                <p>Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Horses</a> sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.</p><p>According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.</p><p>"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game," reads the statement. "The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siQWaPrkrI0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/siQWaPrkrI0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/" data-ref-id="1100-6536662">Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle</a> just before its release. </p><p>The cancellation of Horses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">by three of the major PC game distributors</a> comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">Itch</a>. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.</p><p>"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. "For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p><p>Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>.</p>

                <p>If you've been looking for more of a challenge from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, then you're about to get it. Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience.</p><p>To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it "the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light." It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons.</p><p>The dev team must not have thought the new Volatiles were enough to make Nightmare Experience a true challenge. Now players have to deal with hunger, which is tracked through The Hunger System. If players don't keep their character fed, they will succumb to debilitating effects that will weaken their stamina, health regeneration, and combat efficiency. The developers even added more challenge to the game by using the flashlight--its battery can become too low to use if players don't periodically recharge or replace it.</p><p>The rest of the additions to the game are included below.</p><h2>Dying Light: The Beast Update 1.5 Notes</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>New Game+ &amp; Legendary Levels</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the NewGame+ and Legendary Levels progression curves to reduce farming exploits and balance the experience better.</li><li>Starting a NewGame+ will now check the Legend Level of players to adjust enemies difficulty accordingly.</li><li>Reaching Legend Level 300 before reaching NewGame+ 10 will make enemies' difficulty adjust accordingly.</li></ul><h3>Legend Levels</h3><ul><li>Fixed the possibility for players with no Legend Levels progress to pick up Legend Levels reward weapons left by coop teammates and obtain blueprints of such weapons</li><li>Balanced mods bonus damage related to Legend Levels Rewards</li><li>Balancing of durability of legend weapons Balanced situation where car HP scaled inconsistent with player damage for legend levels</li><li>Fix for the buff “+15% damage (humans) of “Butcher’s Dream” failing to apply correctly</li><li>Fix for critical hit damage does not scaling accordingly with legend levels</li><li>Fixed cases of weapon mods and charms multiply base damage different than the one visible to the player</li></ul><h3>NewGame+</h3><ul><li>Balancing amount of XP granted on higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Suiciders, Gas Tank Bitters and Gas Tank Virals fixes of explosion strength for higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Fixed the case of XP loss on Story Mode NewGame+ upon player’s death</li><li>Fixes related to AI having higher ranks than quest rank in cases where it is not intended</li></ul><h3>Performance &amp; Stability</h3><ul><li>Fixed multiple COOP crash cases when peer joins the host</li><li>Fixed a crash triggered by changing FPS limiter values</li><li>Fixed instances of FPS drops when switching graphics settings from Ultra to High</li></ul><h2>Graphical improvements</h2><h3>Raytracing</h3><ul><li>Fixed laggy tree shadows when Raytracing enabled</li><li>Applied various lighting fixes in Side Quest interiors on Raytracing mode</li><li>Fixed COOP synchronization issues on PS5</li><li>Fixed graphical artifacts in the Exile cave upon adjusting Upscaler settings</li><li>Implemented various occluder fixes across the environment</li><li>Fixed rectangular blood shapes on the Peacekeeper weapon</li><li>Fixed of reward icons glowing irregularly depending on how players highlight or claim rewards</li></ul><h2>Environmental &amp; navigational fixes</h2><ul><li>Resolved an environmental issue in the Exile Cave where players get stuck behind a tent</li><li>Corrected several geometry gaps visible when climbing ledges in the old town</li><li>Addressed several geometry gaps visible when climbing ledges in the swamps area</li></ul><h2>UI &amp; Audio</h2><ul><li>Fixed the big message for Legend Level gained suggests using "U" key for the Skills Menu instead of the correct "L" key</li><li>Resolved missing strings related to Legend Levels</li><li>Applied several Steamdeck UI issues related to misaligned or overlapping text</li><li>Fixed weapon damage display for high Legend Levels (above 10m)</li><li>Fixed the crest of recommended Legend Levels in the NewGame+ config screen not matching the actual Legend Levels crest of players on higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Re-enabled Photo Mode at the beginning of NewGame+</li><li>Adjusted the NewGame+ category title in Public Games section to prevent overlapping with other titles in certain languages</li><li>Corrected the camouflage skill sound not playing correctly</li></ul>

                <p>The Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy has now sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it among the best-selling games of all time.</p><p>Warner Bros. Games made the announcement today, December 17, amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-urges-shareholders-to-reject-paramounts-rival-bid-for-the-studio/1100-6537048/" data-ref-id="1100-6537048">parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's sale to Netflix, or Paramount.</a> At 40 million sales, the game is a smash hit, but not quite close enough to break into the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814"> top 10 best-selling games ever. </a></p><p>Hogwarts Legacy was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games through its Portkey Games label, which handles Harry Potter games for the company.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s with players coming to Hogwarts as a fifth-year student as they learn spells and tame magical creatures.

Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.</p><p>"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe," Okamoto told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-interview-okamoto-konami-americas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> through a translator. "For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further."</p><p>Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have "been affected by a lot of military governments and coups," before adding, "There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs."</p><p>However, Okamoto noted that Konami potentially partnering with a development studio in Central and South America for a Silent Hill game may be difficult because the region doesn't have many to choose from. But he didn't rule it out. </p><p>Okamoto recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-producer-explains-how-fan-art-and-memes-have-kept-it-trending/1100-6536592/" data-ref-id="1100-6536592">credited memes and fan art</a> for keeping Silent Hill f trending months after its release. An update for that game also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-update-adds-new-casual-difficulty-skip-feature-for-new-game-plus/1100-6536180/" data-ref-id="1100-6536180">added a new casual difficulty</a> and a skip feature for new game plus. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake appears to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-quietly-confirmed-for-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536398/" data-ref-id="1100-6536398">quietly confirmed for Xbox Series X|S</a>. Microsoft and Konami have yet to announce a release for that port. </p>
