                <p>After starring in multiple Naughty Dog games, actor Troy Baker continues his working relationship with the studio for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The actor recently discussed working with director Neil Druckmann, what it feels like to not play the lead in a Naughty Dog game, and how he wants to have a career similar to Oscar-winner George Clooney.</p><p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/troy-baker-makes-first-comments-about-naughty-dogs-intergalactic-game-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to ComicBook</a>, Baker said one thing that's stayed the same working with Druckmann on Intergalactic after starring in The Last of Us series as Joel and as Sam in Uncharted 4 is that they still butt heads.</p><p>"Neil and I will always, it's our vibe," he said. "We just love to butt up against each other. We were doing a table read, and I was literally like, 'Why are you giving me shit right now? I'm asking you a question!' And everybody else is like, 'Our mom and dad are fighting, are we still going to Disneyland?' We're fine. We're fine!"</p><p>Baker didn't say exactly what he and Druckmann were clashing on, nor do we even know much about the character Baker plays in Intergalactic... or the story of the game, for that matter.</p><p>Also in the interview, Baker discussed playing a supporting role in Intergalactic after playing one of the leads in the Last of Us franchise. This time around, Baker said he's excited to sit back somewhat, with Tati Gabrielle's character, Jordan A. Mun, serving as the lead.</p><p>"I've had a hell of a career. This industry owes me nothing. What a ride. I don't think that I deserve or need any more," he said. "But I am enjoying it now, now that I understand more about game development, I enjoy the process more than I do the credit. So I'm enjoying the position that I have, which I still feel is a very important position with Intergalactic."</p><p>Intergalactic is in development now for PlayStation 5, and one of the things that Druckmann keeps saying about it is that it has the "deepest gameplay" ever for a Naughty Dog game, whatever that means. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not expected to release until 2027</a>. Naughty Dog may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><h2><strong>"I want to be like George Clooney"</strong></h2><p>Baker also discussed his career ambitions on a longer timeline, saying he wants to "be like George Clooney," the Oscar-winning actor whose career has spanned decades and many different genres.</p><p>"I want to have my Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? and my Michael Clayton, and some of his directing work too," Baker said. "He's just an amazing person. The things that he’s able to create and the reason why he continues to be in things like Oceans 11, Up in the Air, or The American is because people just want to work with him."</p><h2>Baker's career</h2><p>Baker may be best known for his roles in Uncharted and The Last of Us, but he's done much more beyond those two Naughty Dog franchises. He also played the main character, Booker DeWitt, in BioShock Infinite and Rhys in Tales from the Borderlands. Baker also voiced Talion in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Agent Jones in Fortnite. Baker is also known for portraying the villain Pagan Min in Far Cry 4 and Higgs in the Death Stranding series, and has voiced Batman in some Lego projects.</p><p>More recently, he played the iconic character Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Original Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">praised Baker's performance in the game</a> and how he achieved it without AI.</p><p>In 2022, Baker partnered with a blockchain company called Voiceverse and was caught up in drama related to AI and plagiarism. He later <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/troy-baker-ends-partnership-with-nft-firm-and-says-sorry-for-hate-or-create-comment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cut ties with the company</a> and owned up to what he described as antagonistic remarks he made when the collaboration was first announced.</p><p>Baker is also a musician and has released multiple albums. On TV, he appeared in HBO's The Last of Us in a Season 1 episode as the cannibal <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/James" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">James</a>.</p>

                <p>The two-decade wait for player housing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is nearly over, as Blizzard has announced housing will launch on December 2 for those who preorder the Midnight expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Housing will be launching into what Blizzard is calling "early access"--and will support weekly housing quests but won't have its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">Neighborhood event system</a> fully online. Players will, however, be able to buy a home, decorate it, design rooms, join Neighborhoods, earn decor through achievements, and craft decor items. Those who don't own Midnight won't be able to purchase a home but will still be able to acquire housing items and decor, should they later decide to upgrade to the new expansion.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1988668119611478523?s=20" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.2.7 packs a punch with...<br>🏘️ Housing early access + weekly quests<br>📖 Midnight’s Prologue Campaign<br>🚀 Revamped experiences for new + returning players <br>And much more! <a href="https://t.co/XetLDy5VDe" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XetLDy5VDe</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1988668119611478523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While housing is the big new attraction, and one that players have waited over 20 years for, there are some other new features rounding out the 11.2.7 update. That includes a prologue questline to set up the story of Midnight, a new Lorewalking campaign centered around the origins of the Blood and Void Elves of Azeroth, and a quest chain to unlock Pandaren Heritage armor. The Timewalking event Turbulent Timeways will also make a return, and will for the first time feature dungeons from 2020's Shadowlands expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major addition coming in The War Within's final patch is a revamped new- and returning-player experience. New players will journey from the Exile's Reach tutorial zone straight into the Dragonflight expansion. Returning players will be able to travel to a new experience that sees them team up with Thrall and Jaina, after which they'll be equipped in level-appropriate gear and able to jump into the rest of the game as they see fit. A "recap" version of The War Within will additionally be available to new or returning players who wish to play through an accelerated version of the expansion to get caught up with the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">The arrival of housing is a major moment for Blizzard's MMORPG, though some players do have concerns with how Blizzard is looking to monetize the highly anticipated feature. Last week, Blizzard revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/" data-ref-id="1100-6536042">premium currency called Hearthsteel</a> that will be used to purchase housing items on the game's shop, sparking swift outcry from concerned players. Blizzard said the introduction of Hearthsteel is intended to be player-friendly and more convenient for making smaller purchases.</p>

                <p>As part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">Valve's big hardware announcements today</a>, the company did not disclose a price for the new Steam Machine device. Hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat was asked in an interview about what Valve's position is, at a high level, regarding pricing, and Aldehayyat said the aim is to land at a "competitive price" that matches up with the value provided. This is what most companies say about their new products, and Valve is following suit. The aim, he said, is to make it "affordable."</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>Aldehayyat said affordability is a key concern for many today, maybe more than ever, as <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inflation ticks up</a> and concerns remain ongoing due to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>"The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible," Aldehayyat added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a lot of nebulous talk, but it's as much as Valve was willing to say at this juncture. The system is set to be released in Spring 2026, with preorders presumably opening beforehand.</p><p>Valve also did not disclose the prices for the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame virtual reality headset. You can read more about the new Valve devices in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">GameSpot's extended coverage. </a></p><p>Beyond the new hardware, Valve is working on a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-deadlock-has-a-super-secret-invite-only-alpha-different-from-the-known-invite-only-alpha/1100-6531294/" data-ref-id="1100-6531294"> MOBA game called Deadlock</a>. The secretive game has been available for testing, but still has no release date or full details.</p>
