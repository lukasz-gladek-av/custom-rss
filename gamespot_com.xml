                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> Achievement/Trophy for killing another player in PvP combat is titled "Crossing The Threshold," and after 120 hours of intentional pacifistic gameplay, when I saw that alert come across my screen, I felt like I had done exactly that: I'd waded into uncharted territory. More than that, I'd found myself in a world I didn't even want to be in. I'd prided myself on never killing another player in the game. Through dozens and dozens of rounds, I'd gone well out of my way to avoid such an outcome, often being slow to shoot first, even to my own detriment. I put my trust in other players, and sometimes it would prove unwarranted. Mostly, I'd resorted to diplomacy, often talking my way out of problems with other players I'd encounter. I had so many big ideas about what it takes to return to Speranza without blood on one's hands. To me, Arc Raiders was this exciting social experiment. How long can I effectively talk down other players who means me harm? In the end, the answer was about 122 hours of play.</p><p dir="ltr">The fateful encounter occurred on Stella Montis, which will be no surprise to some Arc Raiders veterans. This newest map, and the first to take place entirely indoors, is an ultra-tense setting where you are either diligently checking your corners or you're soon bleeding out on the ground. Even in solo queues, where Arc Raiders remains mostly the bastion of good-natured and helpful PvE-only players, it feels like Stella Montis is kill-or-be-killed more than the game's other maps.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I was minding my own business, cautiously looting but certainly not planning to hurt anyone, when I heard some gunfire nearby. Hiding behind some lockers, I had a clear view of this fight, except for when it wrapped into the next room via the open doors leading to a hallway. I was still within range to hear the proximity chat of those who were scrapping, and witnessed with my eyes and/or ears a scuffle that took the lives of at least two players, whose flares shot toward the ceiling from inside the hallway. I crouched a safe distance away from the noise, then continued exploring other rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">I knew then that at least one person on the map that round had ill intentions, so I was more guarded than before, but I ran into some more friendly folks, and the round proceeded as most do for me in Arc Raiders; the troublemakers are always outnumbered. A few minutes later, I'd wrapped around and upstairs, and found myself now in the same region overlooking the dramatic hallway, only now I was a floor higher. Right then, I heard a pair of voices bickering from inside the hallway. One player was upset that the other had resorted to PvP because they felt solo queues aren't meant to be so unfriendly. The two had a reasonable philosophical discussion, as you can expect, but eventually one of the voices stopped talking.</p><p dir="ltr">I opened the hallway door, which had been closed during the scuffle, and called out, "What's going on in here? You guys good?" A player called out in response, but I couldn't tell by his voice if he was the apparent aggressor or the one attacked and seemingly resorted to killing in self-defense--a quick peek in the hallway revealed three or more raider bodies, to my memory. I couldn't see the survivor, but he told me he was knocked and asked if I had a defib. I always carry one because helping strangers in this game is my favorite way to play. But still, I was unsettled by all the chaos that this hallway had played host to in just a few minutes, so I wasn't so willing to walk in the door myself. I told him, "Crawl to me. I do have a defib. Crawl to me, and I'll revive you." "Crawl to you?" he asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, can you make it in time?" I wondered, knowing his lifebar was evaporating, <em>if </em>he was truly knocked like he said he was.</p><p dir="ltr">He never said another word. Thanks to the way I peeked the corner, I saw him, not knocked, but standing--<em>sprinting</em>--into my room. He turned the corner and opened fire, and the only reason I survived is that I had a Torrente LMG with a few attachments--a decisive, unforgiving weapon at close range. Though the deceiver hit me first, my Torrente tore into him and knocked him sooner than he could knock me.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd found myself in these situations before. I hadn't killed anyone to that point in my Arc Raiders life, but I'd knocked a few. However, I always revived them or let their teammates revive them. I'd explain how I hadn't crossed that threshold yet, and I didn't want to start with them. It usually ended with them seeming thankful for my mercy.</p><p dir="ltr">I admit, I probably would've done the same with this charging liar if he gave me a chance, but he didn't. As soon as I knocked him, perhaps out of embarrassment for having been caught trying to pull a fast one on me, he used the "give up" command, effectively ending his life and crediting me with the kill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056"></a><figcaption>This is just some of the carnage this hallway saw, though my first kill is just off-screen on the other side of the doorway on the right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Before this round, I'd always wondered what I'd say to the first person I intended to kill in Arc Raiders. I'd go on some half-joking speech about how they were the first to bring me to that point, like a character in a movie who'd finally snapped, forcing them to listen to my diatribe as they crawled at my boots. But in the end, I never even got the chance. I only said one sentence to the raider before he quickly bled out: "Why'd you do it?!" Naturally, he didn't answer.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt a rush wash over me. Despite the violence that hallway had seen, I didn't see my part in it coming. I guess in the back of my head, I'd figured I'd talk my way out of a scuffle, or maybe I'd sneak away unscathed. Heck, maybe I'd just be the next gunned down, too slow to pull the trigger myself, but I certainly wasn't going to be the one leaving with bloodied hands. Until I was.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, I've killed one other player--also on Stella Montis and also because they'd charged me and fired first, then chose the "give up" command. I still play this game in a friendly way. I always carry a defib or two. If someone calls out, "Don't shoot!" with the game's vital emote wheel, I tell them they have nothing to worry about, and I mean it. But now that I've crossed the threshold, I do feel like the mental block that left me slow on the draw has lifted. Now, if I see other raiders, I tend to ask if they're friendly. If they say nothing, I get on my guard, and even if they say they're friendly, I keep my eye on them. I still don't ever plan to start fights, but since that fateful day in the halls of Stella Montis, I'm more prepared to finish them.</p>

                <p>Mark Cerny--best known as the lead architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5--recently appeared on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hh8BAr4dqZ792CwE1db3r?si=0580cf10e978457a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console</a> podcast to choose five games he would preserve on a fictional console. While much of the conversation naturally touched on his long history with Sony, one of the most surprising and heartfelt moments came when he talked about his love for Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin/">Pikmin</a>.</p><p>Despite his deep ties to PlayStation, Cerny made it clear that Pikmin left a lasting mark on him. Cerny described playing the original Pikmin as a truly "transformative" experience. He explained how emotionally invested he became in Captain Olimar's struggle to survive and return home.</p><p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs. Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin, I just [picked] out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story," Cerny explained. "Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands, and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship, or he'll run out of oxygen and die, and he's sending letters home every day."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYUJwdN07dI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYUJwdN07dI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He went on to say how he loves a good story and the evolution in Pikmin 2. "I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right. But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure.”</p><p>Although Pikmin was the emotional highlight of their conversation, Cerny also discussed the other games he selected for his fantasy console. These included Atari's Defender--a nod to his early days in the industry--as well as Sony's The Legend of Dragoon, the narrative-focused indie game Firewatch, and the highly acclaimed action-roguelike Hades. Together, his choices span several decades and represent a broad look at the evolution of game design.</p><p>Cerny stressed that he wasn't choosing games as a hardware designer, thinking about technical benchmarks. "I should also say this is not me designing a console, right? Because if I [were] doing that, it would be the usual, 'Well, how does GTA 6 play on it?' I'm just looking at interesting games over five decades."</p><p>Cerny's career has taken him through major studios, having created Marble Madness at Atari and worked on Sonic 2 after helping establish the Sega Technical Institute. Even being most associated with PlayStation hardware and Sony’s first-party studios today, seeing those plant-powered heroes on his list was quite a surprise.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has provided game file sizes for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch and Switch 2, letting console owners know how much space they need to download the first-person adventure game. On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4 comes in at an estimated 31.6GB, while the original Switch version only takes up 26.3GB, per <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">the Nintendo Store</a>. Intriguingly, though, the eShop accessed via Switch 2 showcases the Switch edition as taking up 28.9GB.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, it makes sense Metroid Prime 4 has a bigger download size on Switch 2, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-upgraded-original-switch-games-including-metroid-prime-4-and-pokemon-legends/1100-6530551/">the game offers 4K visuals</a> in quality mode docked and 120fps in performance mode docked. There is also HDR support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">and mouse controls</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/">the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers</a>. Both versions will launch this Thursday, December 4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 - Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The wait for the game has been almost two decades in the making, as Metroid Prime 3 released in 2007. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2017-metroid-prime-4-announced-for-nintendo-swi/1100-6450893/">Metroid Prime 4 was originally unveiled at E3 2017</a>, months after the original Switch launched. Bandai Namco was initially developing the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Retro Studios was brought on to reboot Metroid Prime 4</a> in early 2019. Retro was the studio behind the first three Metroid Prime games.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the game in November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-metroid-prime-4-trailer-has-space-battles-samus-flips-and-an-akira-slide/1100-6535914/">showing off space battles, Samus flips, and even an Akira slide</a>.
