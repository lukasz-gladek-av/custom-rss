                <p>Steam is rolling out a new questionnaire for developers that makes it easier for them to highlight <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-xbox-playstation-are-teaming-up-for-accessible-games-initiative/1100-6530272/" data-ref-id="1100-6530272">accessibility features</a> in their games. Later in 2025, it will also become easier for players to search for games with specific accessibility features.</p><p>These updates were outlined in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/536595840131663919" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on April 22. In the "Edit Store" section for a game on Steamworks, developers can now complete an accessibility support questionnaire to confirm that their game has various gameplay, audio, visual, and input accessibility options. From there, developers can self-identify their game's level of accessibility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481080" data-ratio="0.41045454545455" data-width="2200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481080"></a><figcaption>This is what the accessibility support questionnaire game developers can now fill out on Steamworks looks like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png"></figure><p>For now, this will only be visible within Steamworks, but later this year, it will have more public-facing uses. Developers will eventually be able to share information from this questionnaire on the Steam Store and App pages. Steam users will also gain the option to search for specific accessibility features. The following accessibility filters for search have been confirmed by Valve:</p><ul><li>Adjustable Difficulty</li><li>Save Anytime</li><li>Adjustable Text Size</li><li>Subtitle Options</li><li>Color Alternatives</li><li>Camera Comfort</li><li>Custom Volume Controls</li><li>Stereo Sound</li><li>Surround SOund</li><li>Narrated Game Menus</li><li>Playable without Timed Input</li><li>Keyboard Only Option</li><li>Mouse Only Option</li><li>Touch Only Option</li><li>Chat Speech-to-text</li><li>Chat Text-to-speech</li></ul><p>Valve explains that it is implementing these features to bring "a more positive experience on Steam for everyone by making it easier to find games that support Accessibility features." It's not required that devs fill out the questionnaire, but Valve says it is "highly recommended" because it will make it easier for players with accessibility needs to find these games.</p><p>If you're a Steam user, expect to see these game accessibility-focused improvements on Steam sometime this year.</p>

                <p>Nintendo confirmed that the GameCube Controller designed for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be compatible with games outside of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/" data-ref-id="2900-6400">Switch Online GameCube Classics library</a>, but some issues may arise when using it in that way.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-gamecube-controller-compatible-with-other-games-but-there-may-be-some-issues" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>, Nintendo explained that the controller is designed for use with classic games, so issues may arise when using it with other games. This confirms its compatibility with other Switch 2 software, although Nintendo is getting ahead of any problems that arise with that by pointing out that there could be issues. Hopefully, it at least works with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> on Switch 2.</p><p>"The Nintendo GameCube controller is designed for use with the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics collection of games and is an optional way to play those games," Nintendo's full statement explains. "Since it doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games. The Nintendo GameCube controller can only be used on Nintendo Switch 2 and is not compatible with Nintendo Switch."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MvkSVs8f_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MvkSVs8f_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Switch 2's GameCube controller was revealed alongside the addition of GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">April 2 Switch 2 Direct</a>. It features a very similar layout to the original GameCube controller, but works wirelessly and has the Home, Capture, C, and ZL buttons present on the Joy-Con 2 controllers. A disclaimer in one of Nintendo's trailers suggested that the Switch 2's GameCube Controller wouldn't work with other games, which is why Nintendo had to clarify this in the first place.</p><p>This new GameCube controller will become available for preorder on the My Nintendo Store the same day as Nintendo Switch 2. Currently, that date appears to be May 8.
