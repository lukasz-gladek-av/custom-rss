                <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra doesn't have an official release date or even window yet beyond "2025," but according to one of the game's voice actors, we could be playing it by the end of the year. </p><p>The game's Black Panther voice actor, Khary Payton, told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, "We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025. We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." While the game seemingly already had a 2025 release window, Payton's comment at least narrows down a potential launch month.</p>

But things don't always go smoothly with these early updates, and that seems to be happening here. For what it's worth, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft makes it plain and clear in the Xbox Insider terms that the pre-release testing phase is unstable</a>, but this latest update is notable for the damage it's doing.</p><p>Players are reporting that their entire profiles are being removed. Reporter Tom Warren of The Verge <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1897635419585380791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said this happened to him as well</a>. He said this kind of thing is known to happen with pre-release software.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> encountered the wipe as well. The site said previously installed games remained on the console, but all other settings were deleted.</p><p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha/2025/03/alpha-2504-250303-2200" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The purpose of the Xbox Insider update</a> was to fix an issue with Xbox profiles that could cause your own profile to appear as if they were viewing another person's profile. The update also aimed to address an issue where your Xbox would not correctly detect Dolby Vision setups. Clearly, the update's release did not go as planned if it's removing profiles entirely.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/xboxinsider" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Xbox Insider social media account</a> has not commented on the issues with the update that players are reporting as of press time.</p><p>If you're currently in the Xbox Insider program and want to leave, you can navigate to the Xbox Insider Hub and select "Leave Preview." To completely close an account, users can navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage account</strong> &gt; <strong>Close account</strong>.</p><p>The number of people in the Xbox Insider program is unknown, as Microsoft does not share that data, but it's likely that only a very small percent of total Xbox users are in it.</p>

Capcom has announced the Event Quest schedule for Monster Hunter Wilds, which gives players a chance to earn exclusive gear.</p><p>The Event Quests are somewhat similar to live-service content in other games, but the key difference is that Capcom isn't charging players to take part in these limited-time events. The first two Event Quests, Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo and Stalking Supper, are already live. Players who complete these hunts can earn the Mimiphyta α headgear and Kunafa cheese, respectively. But those Event Quests will only run until March 10, when the next events begin. The complete schedule--with rewards and requirements--is included below.</p><h3>March 3</h3><p><strong>Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Yian Kut-Ku to obtain materials for the Mimiphyta α headgear!</li></ul><p><strong>Stalking Supper - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Quematrice to obtain Kunafa Cheese that you can use as an additional ingredient when cooking.</li></ul><h3>March 10</h3><p><strong>Tongue-Tied - 5 Stars (HR 21 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Tempered Chatacabra to obtain Hard Armor Spheres and Advanced Armor Spheres to upgrade armor.</li></ul><p><strong>Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Yian Kut-Ku to obtain materials for the Mimiphyta α headgear.</li></ul><h3>March 17</h3><p><strong>Ballet in the Rain - 5 Stars (HR 21 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Tempered Lala Barina to obtain Glowing Orb - Swords to use as weapon decorations.</li></ul><p><strong>Sand-Scarred Soul - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Doshaguma to obtain Glowing Orb - Armors to use as armor decorations.</li></ul><p><strong>Like a Fire Hidden by Sand - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Rathian to obtain the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition.</li></ul><p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-top-5-all-time-on-steam-for-concurrent-players/1100-6529828/" data-ref-id="1100-6529828">the top five for most concurrent players of all time on Steam</a>, peaking at over 1.3 million.
