                <p>While traveling throughout Mio and Zoe's fictional worlds, you might notice benches spread across the levels. There are <strong>six benches</strong> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> in total, and resting on all of them will give you an insight into their worlds in the form of a short conversation. It'll also give you the Sisters: A Tale of Two Besties achievement, so they're worth seeking out if you're trying to get all of the trophies. Both girls must sit on the bench for it to count, and you'll know it's successful if the cameras pan together and the conversation begins.</p><p>Below we've laid out <strong>all six benches in Split Fiction</strong> and precisely where to find them. Plan ahead with our guide as some of these can be easily missed or cut off by triggering cutscenes or parts of a level.</p><h2 id="Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</h2><p>The first bench is near the pool section, which is also the same area as the Mountain Hike side story. After landing on the hotel roof, head to the back and use the zipline to get to the next balcony across. On the left you'll see the bench. If you jump onto the passing car to progress the level, you can't go back, so make sure to seek this out before you go too far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932"></a><figcaption>Neon Revenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><p>Before completing the Ice King palace puzzle, it's time to look for this level's bench. Go to the back of the room, and you'll find a balcony with a beautiful view. If you're not already in your human forms, shapeshift into them and take a seat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454933"></a><figcaption>Hopes of Spring</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><p>After taking off your jet packs, you'll see a long window with a corridor ahead of you. Alongside the window you'll find the bench. You can't really miss this one!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454934" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454934"></a><figcaption>Final Dawn</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><p>In the Water Temple area of the level, Mio and Zoe need to split up to complete the water wheel puzzle. After finishing the puzzle, immediately look to the back of the area, and you'll spot a stone bench covered in patches of moss. It does blend in and doesn't look a whole lot like a bench, but walking towards it will bring up the prompt to sit down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454935"></a><figcaption>Rise of the Dragon Realm</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png"></figure><h2 id="Isolation">Isolation</h2><p>After controlling the raft in the sewers, you'll find an area where Zoe has to jump into a large metal container. Before taking the plunge, though, walk around the outskirts of the huge trash piles to find this level's bench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454937"></a><figcaption>Isolation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="The_Hollow">The Hollow</h2><p>After jumping across the beams of light, you'll find yourself on a ledge. Immediately to your left, the bench will look out across the landscape. This is the final bench to sit on, so you should get the achievement notification as soon as Mio and Zoe take a seat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454938"></a><figcaption>The Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you're familiar with the areas that Mio and Zoe need to sit down to earn the achievement, take a look at how to survive the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>, or how to cross the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-get-past-underlands-piranhas/1100-6529867/" data-ref-id="1100-6529867">piranha-infested waters</a> of the Underlands.</p>

                <p>When Activision revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4/" data-ref-id="5000-666086">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this week, the company didn't get into specifics about whether or not the two-minute time-limit structure from the older games will carry forward to the re-release. Now, developer Iron Galaxy has cleared up the situation.</p><p>The original Pro Skater 3 included a two-minute time limit to complete a level's challenges, but this was removed in Pro Skater 4; players could freely explore levels and complete missions at their own pace for its career mode. When Activision announced the re-release of 3+4 this week, many wondered if there would be a time limit in Pro Skater 4, with confusion stemming from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product pages that mentioned a "two-minute format."</a></p><p>GameSpot understands that THPS 3+4 will have a shared feature set that aims to unify the two games. Objectives for players to complete will be based on a timer for both games. That said, the game has a Free Skate mode with no timer at all. The game also has Speed Run and Single Session modes.</p><p>Basically, this means the setup in THPS 3+4 is different from the original version of Pro Skater 4. The Free Skate mode in THPS 3+4 does not let you complete challenges in the same way that players could in Pro Skater 4's Career mode.</p><p>THPS 3+4 launches on July 11 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC--it'll also be on Game Pass at launch. People who pay more money can start playing three days early, starting July 8.

                <p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, and with no end in sight, members of the SAG-AFTRA union held their first picket of 2025 this week and further discussed why the issue of AI is so critical.</p><p>Resident Evil Village actor and member of the negotiating committee Andi Norris told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-picket-1236328677/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that picketing paused for a period due to the Los Angeles wildfires and "everything that the world is dealing with" currently. But picketers returned to the WB Games offices in Burbank, California this week, with Norris said the aim is to ensure that people understand that the voice actors are "still fighting."</p><p>According to the report, the two sides have come to terms on 24 of 25 items, with the one outstanding issue being protections against generative AI.</p><p>Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Spider-Man in Insomniac's game series, said he wants the game companies to ensure actors that the voice data they've recorded cannot be used to "manufacture a performance that we had no say over." Lowenthal also stressed how compensation is a critical element in the ongoing negotiations, saying, "If you're going to do something like that, then we deserve a piece of that."</p><p>Another actor, <a href="https://scottlambright.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scott Lambright</a>, said they expect the rise in AI to lead to a future where there are studios that use AI and studios that do not use AI. "It's going to create a gulf in quality between art made by passionate people and, I guess the term is <em>slop</em>," the actor said.</p><p>Before this, Mass Effect actor Jennifer Hale discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why AI is an "existential" issue</a> in the ongoing back-and-forth for the strike.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with work stoppage spanning 18 months. Hale was involved in those discussions, too, and she said a key difference between the strike of 2016 and 2024/2025 is that the two sides had productive side bars without attorneys involved.</p><p>"My understanding is that in this particular negotiation up until very, very recently, they haven't been allowed to talk to each other. They can each talk to their attorney, and then the attorneys talk to each other. And until you have the people with the vested interest having the conversations, all that's happening is billable hours are going up," she said, referring to attorney fees.</p><p>The picket this week at WB Games comes not long after that company announced dramatic changes, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">cancellation of a Wonder Woman game, layoffs, and the closure of three studios.</a></p>

Called Unfinished Business, the new content sees RoboCop return to Omni Tower after an army of skilled mercenaries have taken over the building, and it'll be launching in the summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Here's the first trailer for it:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZxqWFQI7GY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HZxqWFQI7GY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While it looks like you'll have plenty of targets and challenging opponents in the expansion, it does add an interesting wrinkle in the form of flashback missions. These levels will let players step into the boots of Alex Murphy long before he had his fatal encounter with Clarence J. Boddicker and his gang in the 1987 film. Additionally, the levels featuring RoboCop will also give players access to new weapons, brutal finishers, and special missions.</p><p>RoboCop: Rogue City is admittedly a flawed game, but if you can overlook its rougher parts, you'll find that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-captures-the-vibe-of-the-movies-and-benefits-from-rpg-inspired-gameplay/1100-6514775/" data-ref-id="1100-6514775">incredibly faithful to the source material</a> and a fun blast of '80s action. Teyon had several post-launch updates for the game, including a New Game Plus mode that fans had been requesting.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/robocop-rogue-city-review-id-buy-that-for-a-dollar/1900-6418149/">RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>, reviewer Richard Wakeling called the game a solid--if sometimes poorly paced--shooter full of fun references that RoboCop fans will appreciate. "If you're a fan of RoboCop, then you'll find a lot to love in Rogue City. It's chock full of Easter eggs and manages to capture the look and feel of the first two RoboCop movies with excellent attention to detail, even getting Peter Weller to reprise his role as the eponymous hero."</p>
