                <p>Marvel has announced the return of the Marvel Swimsuit Special later this year, teasing that the new issue will include some future skins for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel announced in a <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> that a new swimsuit special, titled Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1, releases on July 9. As part of the announcement, Marvel said the issues will also contain designs for Marvel Rivals skins in the issue. It certainly sounds like that means swimsuit skins are coming to Marvel Rivals, and a late July or early August event would work perfectly with the summer skins. The blog post doesn't provide any more details about who would be getting these skins, or even what the skins are, but considering they are in the swimsuit issue, they will probably be beach-appropriate.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956" data-ratio="0.75872093023256" data-width="2064" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956"></a><figcaption>Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Marvel Swimsuit Special features a loose plot, with this year's based around Wasp organizing an official swimsuit special after Roxxon Comics made an unofficial one. This is just a pretense to the real plot, which is magazine-style spread of art featuring Marvel characters in swimsuits. Marvel said it would be revealing more about the issue leading up to its release, which could include teases of the Marvel Rivals skins. Based on the blog post, it sounds like it will just include designs that will be in Marvel Rivals and not skins that you can only get by purchasing the comic.</span></p><p>Marvel Rivals has seen continued success since its launch, recently releasing Emma Frost as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-update-adds-emma-frost-krakoa-map-and-cosmetic-gifting/1100-6530825/">Season 2</a>, themed after the Hellfire Gala. It also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-recolor-skins-every-one-revealed-so-far/2900-6485/">new colors</a> for existing skins.</p>

                <p>Star Wars Celebration has kicked off in Japan, and one of the highlights so far is the announcement of a new film in the sci-fi series that'll be directed by Shawn Levy (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>) and will star Ryan Gosling. Star Wars: Starfighter was revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-the-mandalorian-and-grogu-footage-revealed-at-d23/1100-6525692/" data-ref-id="1100-6525692">The Mandalorian and Grogu panel</a>, and it is scheduled to be released on May 31, 2027.</p><p>While details are slim for now, what we do know is that Starfighter is set five years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Gosling will play a brand-new character. In case you're wondering, Star Wars: Starfighter shares nothing--that we know of, so far--with the video game of the same name released for PC, PS2, and Xbox in 2001. The game is currently available on PC platforms like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32350/STAR_WARS_Starfighter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=New+Ryan+Gosling+Star+Wars+Movie+Has+Same+Name+As+This+Great+PS2+Game&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-04-18+06%3A08%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-18+06%3A09%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530960&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_wars_starfighter&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-ryan-gosling-star-wars-movie-has-same-name-as-this-great-ps2-game%2F1100-6530960%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, in case you want to revisit it.</p><p>The obvious difference here is the setting, as the Starfighter video game was set during the prequel trilogy, specifically the invasion of Naboo that took place during Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Similar to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Starfighter featured arcade-influenced action, and players could hop into several different spaceships.</p><p>A sequel, Jedi Starfighter, was released in 2002 and was set during the events of the second Star Wars prequel, Attack of the Clones. The games are also set during the Legends era of Star Wars, a different continuity than the one used by Disney following its purchase of the Star Wars IP several years later.</p><p>Beyond the reveal of the Starfighter film, the first day of Star Wars Celebration had a few more announcements. Former Sith lord Maul will headline a new animated series set after the final season of the Clone Wars, and it will chart his rise to power in the criminal underworld. There was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/AgJftuOvyis" rel="nofollow ">sneak peek at The Mandalorian and Grogu</a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/68YdtaKRO7M" rel="nofollow ">second season of the documentary Light and Magic</a> was announced, and the second expansion for Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://youtu.be/Urp3XfddqZs" rel="nofollow ">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, will be out on May 15.</p>
