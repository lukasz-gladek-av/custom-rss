                <p>Actor Jennifer Hale, who voices Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, has spoken up to share her thoughts on the upcoming Mass Effect TV series. She said in an interview that she's excited to see Mass Effect become a TV show and would love to be a part of it. She also offered a piece of advice to the team making the show that she believes could make the show even better.</p><p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do. The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!" Hale told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer.</a></p><p>She went on to say that the producers would be "really smart" to try to involve as many of the original cast members as possible in the Mass Effect TV series. Hale said she'd love to see her colleagues show up in "cameos and Easter eggs" or even recurring and regular roles.</p><p>"I think that would be an absolutely genius move," she said. "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever metâ€¦ they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p><p>The Mass Effect TV show was announced in 2021 but was not going anywhere until November 2024, which is when Amazon MGM Studios announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">"officially in development."</a> A show being "in development" doesn't mean it'll ever get made, though. Anything can happen in Hollywood.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">A report said</a> Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while EA's Michael Gamble is an executive producer as well. Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too.</p><p>There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>BioWare veteran Mac Walters, who has since left the company, said in 2021 that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">Mass Effect TV show makes more sense than a film</a>. "If you're going to tell a story that's as fleshed out as Mass Effect, TV is the way to do it. There's a natural way it fits well with episodic content," he explained.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect game series, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">new game is now in the works now</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">BioWare's main focus currently</a> after the company released Dragon Age: The Veilguard in October 2024.</p>
