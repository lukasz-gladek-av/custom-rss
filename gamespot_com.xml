                <p dir="ltr">To celebrate 15 years as a studio, MachineGames has announced an anniversary update for Indiana Jones and The Great Circle that will add New Game Plus to the adventure game tomorrow, October 10. In addition, the free patch will feature an outfit from Raiders of the Lost Ark, voice language select, and other general fixes.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/55hh0soSvjTmCwqR6X2VyB/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-machinegames-anniversary-update">the game's website</a>, MachineGames notes that New Game Plus and the Cairo outfit were highly requested from the community. New Game Plus unlocks after completing the main story and will let players keep their unlocked Adventure Books. Since Indy should be stronger, MachineGames recommends pushing the difficulty up a notch. Last but not least, there's a new after-credits scene for players who finish Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on New Game Plus.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u-QnuhfLmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the Cairo outfit sees Indy jacketless, and MachineGames is teasing more looks for the archaeologist over the coming months. As for the voice language select, the developer states: "You can mix and match any of the nine available voice languages with any of the 14 text languages."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-review/1900-6418404/">The Order of Giants DLC</a>, which sees the protagonist pair up with a young priest named Father Ricci in Rome.

                <p>Longtime Xbox devotees have recently seen several former exclusive games go to PlayStation 5, while Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>. Now, one of Xbox's original team members, Laura Fryer, is calling out her former employer and describing the price increases as a "betrayal" of the trust that gamers placed in them.</p><p>"With this latest increase to Game Pass, Xbox threw away one of their last advantages," said Fryer in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest YouTube video</a>. "They were the best deal in gaming... With these price hikes, it feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming... I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn't over yet, it's almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft's greed."</p><p>Fryer went on to recap the two hardware price increases this generation, three separate Game Pass price increases, more expensive games, massive layoffs, and multiple studio layoffs.</p><p>"I believe all of these changes and drama will harm Microsoft's brand," said Fryer. "It appears that Xbox is moving towards cloud gaming and away from hardware, but it also could be that they're just incompetent, that they just don't understand what they're doing... They need to rebuild trust with gamers and fans. I know people on the Xbox team that are still there that were there in the early days... They can fix this and I'm rooting for them and wishing them the best."</p><p>Fryer previously shared her belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a> by outsourcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> to Asus. Xbox VP Jason Ronald reiterated the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">commitment to its next generation hardware</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Following the recent Game Pass announcement, Microsoft revealed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-prices-not-going-up-for-everyone-just-yet/1100-6535288/" data-ref-id="1100-6535288">price hikes won't immediately go into effect</a> for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimates-price-hike-was-quietly-paired-with-another-downside/1100-6535197/" data-ref-id="1100-6535197">losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk</a>. Some analysts believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">an ad-supported Game Pass service</a> will be added in the future.</p>
