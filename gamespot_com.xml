                <p dir="ltr">Earlier today, fans of The Elder Scrolls were delighted not only to officially learn of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-new-and-different-in-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>'s existence, but also that the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/"> game is available now on consoles and PC</a>. However, those who watched the Bethesda livestream who aren't familiar with Cyrodiil and its inhabitants may have had a question: Who the heck was that Adoring Fan?</p><p dir="ltr">In Oblivion, the Adoring Fan is a commoner who lives in the Imperial City and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL4X8fZViU">lavishes praise on you</a> once they become the Grand Champion in the Arena. He's technically a "Follower" in that he'll follow you around the world, but unlike other Followers, his contribution to combat is to run and hide from enemies--which sometimes attracts more in the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751"></a><figcaption>The Adoring Fan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Adoring Fan has gained notoriety in the Elder Scrolls community due to his zealous devotion to following the player around, which can lead to some hilarious situations--if you tell him to leave you alone while standing on top of a mountain, for example, the Fan heads back to the Imperial City via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRi6GBF5zB0&amp;pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv">most direct route possible</a>. He's so notorious, in fact, that Bethesda created a successor to the Adoring Fan in Starfield, though the spacefaring version can only be recruited if you choose the "Hero Worshipped" trait.</p><p dir="ltr">The Oblivion remaster retains much of what made the 2006 RPG so beloved, including the silly bits of dialogue that players still remember today. The remaster was developed by Virtuos Studio, built using Unreal Engine 5, and includes 4K resolution, 60-frames-per second performance, and dynamic time-of-day and weather effects, among other improvements.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is available now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It has also been added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog of downloadable titles.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> might feature all new graphics, mechanics, and animations, but the core of the game has remained intact. This includes the class system, which allows you to further customize your character by giving them a specific specialization. The class you choose also determines your favored attributes and the major skills your character has access to. While you can create a custom class that suits your exact needs in Cyrodiil, the preset classes offer some great options.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available classes in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered as well as our picks for the best overall classes in each of the three categories. If you want a more in-depth look at the classes or a broad overview of the game altogether, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough of Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><h2 id="All_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">All Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>There are three main categories that every class in the game falls into, and each category features seven classes. This gives you a total of 21 classes to choose from. You're able to choose your class after you make your way through the Sanctum area in the tutorial of Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>The class you choose should largely be based on the race and Birthsign you selected earlier in the game, and you'll initially be recommended a class based on those choices. However, you don't have to choose that class or even choose a class in the same category. You're entirely free to make a jack-of-all-trades character that can wreak all sorts of havoc throughout Cyrodiil.</p><p>Here's a list of all 21 classes in Oblivion Remastered:</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><ul><li>Warrior</li><li>Barbarian</li><li>Crusader</li><li>Knight</li><li>Archer</li><li>Scout</li><li>Rogue</li></ul><p><strong>Mage</strong></p><ul><li>Mage</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>Battlemage</li><li>Healer</li><li>Spellsword</li><li>Witchhunter</li><li>Nightblade</li></ul><p><strong>Stealth</strong></p><ul><li>Thief</li><li>Agent</li><li>Acrobat</li><li>Assassin</li><li>Monk</li><li>Pilgrim</li><li>Bard</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730"></a><figcaption>You're able to edit your class and other character options before the tutorial ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png"></figure><p>Your initial class choice can be altered before you leave the Sewers in Oblivion Remastered. Right as you go through the exit door, you're able to change your class, Birthsign, and other character identity options. So if you don't like your class within the first few minutes of testing it, you can change it before you get out into the world of Oblivion.</p><h2 id="Best_Combat_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Combat Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Now that we've reviewed all the classes in each category, it's time to determine which one is the best in each category. First up is the Combat category, which is mainly going to feature your attack-focused classes. The classes in Combat represent two forms of combat, melee and ranged, as well as some subclasses based around those combat types.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735"></a><figcaption>The Combat classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png"></figure><p>If you're a beginner in Oblivion Remastered and you're just looking to stick with a basic class, choose from these three: <strong>Warrior, Archer, Rogue</strong>. These are classic RPG classes, and they focus on a specific playstyle that's easy to grasp.</p><p>The Warrior excels in hand-to-hand combat while wearing heavy armor and has plenty of strength and endurance. You'll mainly wield a melee weapon with a shield, unless you're using a two-handed weapon, like a Battle Axe, and your character will always be able to tank some hits from enemies before you need a healing potion.</p><p>As for the Archer class, this utilizes a bow and arrows to attack enemies from range. Light and medium armor are your friends, so you can keep your stamina up to fire off more shots. You could also choose the Rogue class if you want to use a bow, but Rogues generally use light melee weapons and attack from the shadows. Rogues also excel in thievery and talking their way out of sticky situations while in dialogue.</p><p>While those are the basic Combat classes to pick, if you want something more advanced, go with either<strong> the</strong><strong> Crusader or the Knight</strong>. The Crusader is granted the ability to heal yourself and allies while still wielding large melee weapons, giving you the option to use a couple of playstyles simultaneously. The Knight also uses melee weapons, but they specialize in persuasion through the personality attribute.</p><p>Combat is arguably the most basic of the three categories of classes in Oblivion Remastered, but there are some great options here for beginners and veterans.</p><h2 id="Best_Magic_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Magic Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>As you might expect, the Magic category is all about the art of magicka in Oblivion Remastered. These classes are centered around all forms of magicka, but you'll also gain some bonuses in alchemy for any potions you want to brew down the line.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741"></a><figcaption>The Magic classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png"></figure><p>Arguably the best class in Magic is <strong>Spellsword</strong>, which is also one of the best attacking classes in the game. You gain access to a number of offensive magic skills, including Destruction, Illusion, and Alteration, as well as the Blade and Block skills. Spellswords also have proficiency in heavy armor, which isn't common for a magic class.</p><p>While you'll want to stick with magicka a majority of the time, these skills do allow the Spellsword to whip out a melee weapon every now and again during close range encounters. The <strong>Nightblade</strong> class also features some of these characteristics, but is more of a glass cannon due to its proficiencies in light armor and acrobatics. Of course, if you like light armor more than heavy armor, the Nightblade might be the way to go.</p><p>If neither Spellsword nor Nightblade excites you, then the next best options are <span>either<strong> Sorcerer</strong></span><strong> or Mage</strong>. Both of these classes are a little more on the generic side of things when it comes to magicka, but they're both incredibly powerful. The Mage has access to most forms of magicka in Oblivion Remastered, while the Sorcerer utilizes heavy armor and alchemy to reliably stay healthy.</p><p>The Mage is more of a veteran class choice, while the Sorcerer is better for beginners, but both are viable if you're looking to solely deal damage with magicka.</p><h2 id="Best_Stealth_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Stealth Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the most versatile set of classes in Oblivion Remastered. The Stealth category mainly focuses on the melee and ranged combat types, but the classes themselves offer a number of different benefits outside of combat. You'll gain skills in acrobatics, sneak, speed, speechcraft, and more that make life easier when exploring Cyrodiil and interacting with its many inhabitants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743"></a><figcaption>The Stealth classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png"></figure><p>In our opinion, the two best classes in Stealth are <strong>Assassin and Thief</strong>. Both are somewhat similar in regard to what attributes and skills you gain, but the Assassin focuses more on combat, while the Thief is a class useful for dealing with NPCs and exploration.</p><p>The Assassin class features speed and intelligence as its favored attributes, gaining skills in sneak, acrobatics, light armor, marksman, alchemy, blade, and security. You'll be able to sneak efficiently, deal damage from afar or up close with great precision, and even partake in some alchemy right out of the gate. With how powerful sneaking and ranged combat is in Oblivion Remastered, Assassin just might be the best overall class in the game.</p><p>However, if you're more worried about exploration rather than the combat, the Thief needs to be your pick. Its favored attributes are speed and agility, while it adds the speechcraft and mercantile skills in exchange for blade and alchemy from the Assassin's list of skills. The speechcraft and mercantile come in especially handy when dealing with NPCs during exploration or quests, which can save you a ton of time in the long run.</p><p>If neither Assassin nor Thief floats your boat, though, go with the <strong>Pilgrim or the Bard</strong>. Bards are arguably the best class for persuasion and dealing with NPCs, and the Pilgrim is a great all-around class for either melee or ranged combat as well as exploration.</p>

                <p>An open-world RPG based on Robert Jordan's 14-book fantasy series The Wheel of Time is in the works, 20 years after Red Eagle Entertainment, now rebranded as iwot Studios, acquired the rights to make games based on the series.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/wheel-of-time-video-game-iwot-1236374066/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reports the game will be a "AAA open-world role-playing game" developed wholly in-house by iwot Studios, led by former Warner Bros. Games VP of product development Craig Alexander. The studio is projecting a three-year development cycle for the game, which is slated to release on consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">It's part of the studio's plan to expand The Wheel of Time across film, television, and gaming, which it also owns the rights to. Dev iwot Studios has already served as a producer on Amazon's Wheel of Time TV series, as well as on an upcoming film called Age of Legends and a 3D-animated Wheel of Time film currently in development. CEO Rick Selvage told Variety that there will be synergy between upcoming film projects and the game, but that the game would cover the entirety of Jordan's world.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's an open-world game, and it'll be everything with the Wheel of Time," Selvage said. "Everything that is covered in the books, as well as all the backstory elements of it. As we build out the world, it'll be the entire Wheel of Time World, it's not going to be limited to one area or another or a particular age."</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2008, when iwot was still known as Red Eagle Entertainment, the studio said it had partnered with well-known RPG experts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/obsidian-riding-wheel-of-time/1100-6250423/" data-ref-id="1100-6250423">Obsidian Entertainment to help build a game based on Wheel of Time</a>. The game was originally planned for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. At the time, an MMORPG based on Wheel of Time was also said to be in the works, along with a live-action film from Universal Studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, none of those projects came to pass, so it remains to be seen whether or not this Wheel of Time open-world RPG will come to fruition. Variety notes that Alexander is currently building the studio's leadership team, which will be based in Montreal.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to finally get into Jordan's massive book series (the last three of which were written by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death in 2007) currently have a cheap way to do so, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-all-15-wheel-of-time-novels-and-2-companion-books-for-only-18/1100-6527102/" data-ref-id="1100-6527102">every Wheel of Time book, and two companion books, are currently $18</a> on Humble Bundle.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is also available on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, so the success on Steam represents just a portion of the game's total audience. Steam publishes concurrent player figures, but Microsoft and Sony do not, so we don't have comparable data on console.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered is an updated version of the 2006 RPG, developed by French game developer Virtuos in partnership with Bethesda. The game was built using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, and in addition to visual improvements, the game includes an updated leveling system and other quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>To get a closer look at Oblivion Remastered, check out the screenshot gallery below. The game is available to buy for $50, while Game Pass Ultimate members can grab it as part of their membership. If you want all the horse armor, you'll have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-is-still-charging-for-horse-armor-dlc-history-repeats/1100-6531023/" data-ref-id="1100-6531023">pretend like it's 2006 again and pay extra. </a></p>
