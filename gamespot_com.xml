                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Lego Fortnite</a> is expanding in a big way this week. Not only are we getting a new Lego Pass with piles of new content for the existing Lego Fortnite survival/crafting game, but we're getting an entirely new Lego game, dubbed Brick Life.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life, which launches on December 12, is an open-world social sim in which you and 31 of your closest friends can hang out in Brick Bay, a lively Lego City that's full of activities, jobs, and empty lots you can build on, and Brick Bay will be expanding all the time. For example, December 18 will mark the opening of the Rooftop Club, a fancy social space that provides stunning views of the city from above. The launch of Brick Life happens to coincide with the addition of text chat to every Fortnite experience, which will be key for a social sim like this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527"></a><figcaption>Brick Life is designed as a family-friendly social sandbox mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png"></figure><p>Brick Life isn't just some new Creative Lego island, however--Epic is treating Brick Life as a full new game on the same level as the existing Lego Fortnite survival game. As a result, that original Lego Fortnite game is being rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey, with the term "Lego Fortnite" now referring to everything under that umbrella, rather than a specific mode.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile, is getting its own massive update this week that introduces a new villain, the Storm King, and a new faction that opposes him called the Storm Chasers. This new quest line will cause destructive storms to pop up all over the map at random--you'll need to navigate treacherous Storm Dungeons to make them go away and make progress toward defeating the Storm King.</p><p>All this new content for Lego Fortnite is being accompanied by an all-new Lego Pass, which is headlined by the new Raven Team Syd skin, which unlocks as soon as you buy the pass. Remember that access to the Lego Pass, along with the Music Pass and OG Pass, are now included with Fortnite Crew, so if you subscribe to Crew at any time while this Lego Pass is active, you'll immediately receive the Raven Team Syd skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523"></a><figcaption>The original Lego Fortnite survival game has been rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png"></figure><p>On top of that, Lego Fortnite has some completely free skins it wants to give you. Connecting your Lego and Epic accounts will grant you the Mr. Dappermint skin--he's that giant candy cane that they sell in the shop each December--as well as the Explorer Emilie skin that has been available for doing that since last year. And just for good measure, playing Fortnite on mobile and earning any amount of XP before February 21 will grant you the Chord Kahele skin, which will be the first Festival default skin that will be equippable as a skin, and which also has a Lego style.</p><p>Brick Life is just one of Fortnite's big new modes in Chapter 6, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-1-weapons-map-and-changes/2900-6012/" data-ref-id="2900-6012">OG mode</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-finally-getting-official-first-person-mode-but-its-not-battle-royale/1100-6528295/" data-ref-id="1100-6528295">first-person Ballistic mode</a>. Fortnite's got plenty of stuff to keep us occupied through the holidays, it seems.</p>

                <p>Hold on to your potatoes, because developer MachineGames has released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The update adds path tracing for select Nvidia cards, improved whip behavior, and a host of gameplay fixes, as detailed in the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/ZKn6jyPTe2ElFSJ0yZ2WA/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-1?linkId=100000316950846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's website</a>, MachineGames provided a laundry list of improvements for the action-adventure game, headlined by path tracing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">for PC players</a>. Think of this feature--which is also in the works for AMD cards, according to the developer--as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a souped-up version of ray tracing</a>. That means, for example, offering even more realistic lighting sources and reflections. However, you need the hardware to support it, as the developer says at least 12GB VRAM is needed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2047998103" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
