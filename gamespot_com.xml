                <p>I love Pokemon's turn-based battle mechanics. For nearly 30 years, Game Freak has tuned its rock-paper-scissors style combat to near perfection. Different generations have added new mechanics and gimmicks to keep things fresh, but Pokemon's battles have always been built around turn-based combat. With Pokemon Legends: Z-A, however, Game Freak aims to redefine what a Pokemon battle is, a fact which, naturally, gave me some pause. Yet after nearly two hours with the game, I'm convinced they might have pulled it off.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends: Z-A opens with your character arriving in Lumiose City by train. Unlike Arceus, there is no time travel; Z-A takes place in the present after the events of Pokemon X and Y. Outside of the train station you meet a trainer, either Taunie or Urbain depending on who you pick, who will give you a starter Pokemon: Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. Before I was able to pick the Totodile, the clear winner of the three, we were thrown into a Wild Zone a few hours later in the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Zones are scattered throughout Lumiose City and are home to wild Pokemon waiting to be caught. The zone I explored was crawling with Houndours and Bunearys. The Wild Zone covered a few blocks of Lumiose City, and was much smaller than the expansive areas we saw in Arceus. Based on a few quick glances at the map, this zone seems like one of the smaller ones, but even the larger Wild Zones appeared to be much smaller than any of the regions from Arceus. However, these Wild Zones appear to use Lumiose City's density and verticality to their advantage. I found some back alleys and rooftops that hid items and special encounters, including a level 40 Alpha Pikachu that sent me flying off a multi-story building and electrocuted its way through most of my party. Fortunately, there are cafes dotted throughout Wild Zones that can heal your Pokemon for a small fee. If you or all your Pokemon get knocked out, you're sent back to a Pokemon Center outside of the Wild Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who played Legends Arceus should feel at home with Z-A's catching mechanics as, fundamentally, not much has changed: sneak up on an unsuspecting Pokemon, line up your throw, and chuck a Poke Ball. If you're spotted, you can send out a Pokemon of your own and weaken it before tossing another Poke Ball. It's just as intuitive as it was before, albeit with fewer tools at your disposal. In Arceus you could craft Smoke Bombs to hide, throw berries to distract, and hurl balls of mud to stun Pokemon yet I didn't have access to any of these tools in my session. It's unclear if these have been removed from Z-A, or if they simply weren't available in this demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717"></a><figcaption>The main character and Urbain in front of the three starters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">During this portion of the demo, I was also encouraged to experiment with Z-A's character creator. Like Scarlet and Violet, you can bring up the character screen in the menu and tweak your character's hair and facial features on the fly. Z-A has a lot more clothing customization options than both Scarlet and Violet, too. I didn't spend too much time tweaking my character because of time constraints, but there seems to be plenty of fashion accessories to mix and match.</p><p dir="ltr">After a stint in the Wild Zone, I dipped my toes into the Z-A Royale, a city-wide tournament that tasks contestants with battling through the ranks in order to challenge tougher and tougher opponents. Each night, trainers gather around the city and you'll need to defeat them to earn a Challenger Ticket. Once you've collected enough points, you can participate in a Promotion Match to increase your rank.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Positioning plays a key role. When you issue an attack, your Pokemon automatically moves to a spot where its attack can connect and locks in place, leaving them open for a counter attack.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">During the Z-A Royale, trainers prowl the streets at night with a Pokemon by their side. If you manage to sneak up on them, you'll do some free damage before the battle starts. At the outset, combat feels much more frantic than a traditional Pokemon battle. Attacks are on a cooldown, and you can throw out as many as you'd like regardless of what your opponent is doing. This doesn't mean you can ignore the opposing Pokemon, though. Each move has a speed rating that determines how long the wind-up is, and some moves could leave your Pokemon vulnerable for an extended period of time while others could fire off right away. Moves like Quick Attack, for example, have priority over moves like Flame Wheel, which traditionally requires a bit of a wind-up.</p><p dir="ltr">Other moves, like Whirlwind, Double Team, and Toxic Spikes, have also been redesigned to fit this format. In previous entries, Whirlwind forces a player to switch Pokemon, but in Z-A, it knocks the opposing Pokemon back to free up some space. Double Team, like Protect, appeared to make your Pokemon invulnerable for a period of time. Meanwhile, Toxic Spike, a move that normally punishes switch-ins, now leaves physical traps on the battlefield that will poison an opposing Pokemon that makes contact with them. Seeing how different moves translate to Z-A's combat style was a highlight for me, and I can already think of so many opportunities to use Pokemon's vast moveset to its full potential here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718"></a><figcaption>Tepig facing off against a Simisage for a Promotion Match</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you're exploring these cordoned off Z-A Royale areas, you'll come across Battle Tickets. These offer challenges that, when completed, net you extra points. In the segment I played, these challenges ranged from landing sneak attacks to hitting weaknesses. They were all fairly simple, and most could be completed in one battle with a little extra forethought. That said, I do hope these Battle Tickets get tougher as you progress, as I can see them becoming a chore if the challenges never evolve beyond what I saw. Checking off these challenges while defeating trainers was the most efficient way to rank up in the Z-A Royale, and within 15 minutes or so, I was prepping for my Promotion Match.</p><p dir="ltr">Promotion Matches feel like Z-A's take on gym battles. These battles take place in an arena rather than the streets of Lumiose City, and you can't sneak up on your opponent for an advantage. The trainer I fought was a cook packing Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear. While I didn't have much trouble dispatching his Pokemon, his play style did seem a little more defensive than the rank-and-file I challenged beforehand. Most notably, he was quick to throw up Protects against my super effective attacks. By his third and final Pokemon, I was a little more deliberate when I'd fire off an attack to account for his Protect and its cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo ended with a frantic battle against Mega Victreebell that played out similarly to the Mega Absol fight from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">my first preview</a>. Mega Victreebell was launching attacks left and right, and I had to find openings with my Houndoom to land super effective hits. As I dealt damage, glowing orbs scattered around the arena that eventually let me activate a Mega of my own. Mega Evolved Pokemon can only stay like that for so long, though. Once the meter on the bottom left runs out, they return to their standard form. Collecting more orbs can extend its Mega Evolution, but not by much. Despite having a few Pokemon that could Mega Evolve, I opted to go with Houndoom because of the clear fire type advantage. However, even with the type advantage, Mega Victreebell did manage to knock out my Houndoom, forcing me to send out a different Pokemon while I tended to Houndoom's wounds with items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716"></a><figcaption>A Rogue Mega battle against a Victreebell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These fights are reminiscent of the Frenzied Pokemon battles from Pokemon Legends: Arceus The difference is that you don't need to quell the boss with balms before you battle it. Instead, you are calling out attacks and dodging hazards from the beginning. These battles are much more dynamic, requiring you to split your attention between positioning, attack cooldowns, and HP bars. It wasn't particularly difficult, but there is some depth here that could lead to challenging fights later in the game.</p><p>Throughout every section of my demo, Pokemon Legends: Z-A ran flawlessly on a docked Nintendo Switch 2. It's hard to gauge an exact frame rate without extensive testing, but it looked to be 60 frames per second without any noticeable hitches. Of course, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also coming to the Nintendo Switch, and we have no idea how it runs on Nintendo's last-gen hardware. Hopefully its performance is smoother than Arceus and Scarlet and Violet, but we'll have to wait until next month to see.As promising as Z-A looks, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. I've played around two hours, but I still haven't been able to explore Lumiose City at my own pace. What else does the city have to offer? Does it tie in to Pokemon X and Y in any meaningful way? Are there new regional forms like we saw in Arceus? How does multiplayer work? We'll get answers to these questions very soon when Pokemon Legends: Z-A drops on October 16, 2025.</p>

For now, it's just text chat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560082-roblox-party-features-chat.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_start_or_join_a_Roblox_Party">How to start or join a Roblox Party</h2><p>To start a party, open Roblox on either the PC or mobile app, and go to the Party tab. From there, you can click the plus sign to add users in your friends list to your group. Once you’ve finalized adding the people you want to invite, click or tap the Join button to send the invitation. After everyone arrives, you have the option to pick an experience for you all to play and send invites for them within the Party screen to join your game. Even when you’re offline, the party will still be available for the next time you play.</p><p>If you want to add a user to a party you’ve already created, go to the group you wish to edit and click the three dots on the top right of your screen. You can then select “Add Connections” and search for the player’s username, finally clicking “Add” to include them in the group.</p><p>Those who are waiting to join a party should first ensure that they’re on the host’s friends list. If so, you’ll receive a notification either through the app or via mobile push notifications. You can also open the Party tab to see any active parties. Tap on the host’s party or notification and click “Join” to get into the group.</p><p>There are a few limitations for you to keep in mind. The first is that only players over the age of 13, or a parent or caregiver, can create a party. Those using parental controls can restrict party access entirely or limit it to one-on-one access only, such as you playing a game with your child or having one friend join them at a time. If you are over 13, you can also only chat via text, but voice chat is coming soon. Finally, the maximum party size is six players, including the host.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083"></a><figcaption>As the host, you'll have control over the games you play with your friends, as well as the ability to moderate the party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_keep_your_Roblox_Party_safe_"><span>How to keep your Roblox Party safe</span></h2><p>As the host of the party, you should absolutely be able to trust the players you game with. Should anyone need a time out, you can navigate to the group they are in, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, then the three dots next to the user in question. You can then “Report” or “Remove from group,” depending on how serious it is. Remember that if the user breached the Roblox Community Standards and Terms of Use, you can report the user first, then remove them to ensure that Roblox moderators are aware of the infractions.</p><p>If anyone breaches that trust, either by scamming your friends or other questionable behavior, then it may be time to cut ties with them. Unfriending someone isn’t a nice thing to have to do, but it’s at least a simple process if you need to do it. If they’re an active user, go to the player’s profile on the Roblox website or app, then click the “Remove Connection” button. If you are following that player, you can also click the three-dot menu on the user’s page and select “Unfollow”.</p><p>Suppose the user is banned, temporarily or permanently? In that case, you can find their profile by navigating to the Following or Followers tab on your <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/following" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Connections page</a>, which we’ve provided a link to here for your convenience. From here, you can find the user whose profile box will be deactivated if banned. You can then click the three dots and then “Unfollow” as before.</p><p>If all of the members of the Party someone else created are making you feel uncomfortable, you can leave the group. Use the Party tab on the PC app, find the group you want to leave, then click the three dots on the top right, and select “Leave Group”. This is under the Connections tab on mobile devices.</p><h3 id="How_to_disable_Party_Chat">How to disable Party Chat</h3><p>Users aged 13 and over can disable Party Chat by checking the Connections page and changing the settings from the default settings to “No one”. You can also limit the number of Connections to a one-on-one party if you so wish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560086"></a><figcaption>One of the many experiences you can play with friends is Tower of Hell, as you can see who can get up the course the highest as quickly as possible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Best_Roblox_games_to_play_with_friends_"><span>Best Roblox games to play with friends</span></h2><p>While many of the experiences could work with friends, some are designed with multiplayer as the main focus. Some of the best ones include party games such as Natural Disaster Survival and Epic Minigames, which do their best to invoke the chaotic fun of minigame-focused retail games, like the Mario Party series.</p><p>Other popular games with multiplayer modes include Theme Park Tycoon 2, in which you and your friends can help each other build the best rides and rollercoasters, as well as competitive PVP games like Blox Fruits. Finally, if you’re a little older, Doors is a particularly decent match for friendship groups. As you traipse through the hallways with your buddies watching your back, monsters will spring out of nowhere to scare you and everyone nearby senseless.</p>

                <p>It's a big week for gaming with events like the Tokyo Game Show, but right now, it's time for Sony to show what it has been cooking up with a new State of Play broadcast today, September 24. We've rounded up all the details for the livestream, popped in a few links for where to watch, when it starts, and what you can expect from it. On September 25, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-announced-for-september-25/1100-6534572/" data-ref-id="1100-6534572">you can also tune in for an Xbox livestream</a>, which will be held at a <em>very </em>early time.</p><h2>How to watch the State of Play</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enWyMpM0k4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>State of Play will be streamed live on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> channels and will be broadcast in English.</p><h2>State of Play start time</h2><p>The State of Play broadcast begins today, September 24, at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET and will run for approximately 35 minutes.</p><ul><li>2 PM PT</li><li>5 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CEST</li><li>6 AM JST (September 25)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Sony says that the event will feature reveals and news from developers around the world on third-party games and indie titles. On the first-party side, Sony has confirmed that there'll be an extended look at Housemarque's next game, Saros, with five minutes of PS5-captured gameplay. You can also look forward to updates from some of the teams at PlayStation Studios, but beyond that, Sony is keeping quiet on the specific details here.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2, so we're expecting to see a quick trailer for the game, and this would be a great time to reveal a few new characters for the upcoming superhero brawler from Arc System Works, Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Fans are also eager to see a fresh look at Insomniac's Wolverine game, which was first announced way back in 2021. It has also been a year since Uncharted developer Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, so an update on that game wouldn't be unwelcome.</p><p>If we're digging into rumored reveals, then there might be some pleasant surprises today.
