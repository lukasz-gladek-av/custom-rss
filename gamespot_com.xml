                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2's</a> first new hero of 2025 will be Freya, an explosive crossbow-wielding bounty hunter who can dash and fly around the battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed Freya as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream</a>, diving into more details about the damage-role hero. Freya is a former search-and-rescue operative but now works as a bounty hunter. Her basic crossbow attack will rapidly shoot bolts at enemies. However, her alternate fire sees her taking aim to deliver a high-speed explosive bolt for big damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960" data-ratio="0.56214285714286" data-width="1400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960"></a><figcaption>Freya wields and explosive crossbow and a bola launcher that can pull enemies together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Movement and positioning seems to be a big part of Freya's toolkit, with Blizzard stating she is a "challenging and rewarding" character that will take "precision and a steady aim to master." She has both a quick dash ability (that reloads her crossbow in the process) and a move called Updraft that will launch her into the sky. Her Bola Shot ability pulls enemies together, setting them up for a damaging combo from teammates or a well-placed explosive crossbow shot.</p><p dir="ltr">Freya will join Overwatch 2's roster as part of Season 16 later this year, but players will get the chance to try her out during Season 15 as part of a trial weekend.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962" data-ratio="0.44625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962"></a><figcaption>Aqua will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard shared plenty of details about Freya, she wasn't the only new hero the developer revealed. Aqua, a staff-wielding, water-bending Chinese hero, will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18, Blizzard announced, bringing with him an "innovative playstyle." Blizzard at this stage has only shared concept art for Aqua, but said more details about his abilities would come closer to his release.</p><p dir="ltr">New heroes were just a part of all the announcements to come out of Blizzard's Overwatch 2 Spotlight stream. For starters, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2</a> with Season 15. Blizzard additionally revealed the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks as a new core gameplay system in Overwatch 2</a>, as well as a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based, third-person mode called Stadium</a> that sees players buying items and upgrading their heroes over the course of a match.</p>

                <p>One of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> most best-known features, loot boxes, are coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> as part of Season 15 on February 18--though you won't be able to buy them directly as was originally the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, loot boxes will return as part of Overwatch 2's seasonal free and premium battle passes, as well as rewards for weekly and event challenges. Blizzard is looking to bring more transparency to the system as well, giving players more information in regards to item-drop chances and rarity guarantees.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cf5dPQ7YeE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">An item of Rare or better quality has a chance to drop from every loot box. After opening five loot boxes, players will be guaranteed an Epic-quality item, and after 20 loot boxes, a guaranteed Legendary. Legendary loot boxes, one of which can be earned via the free battle pass (and two through the premium battle pass), have a 100% chance to reward a Legendary item.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it will release more details about the return of loot boxes next week, but it is already a bit of a full-circle moment for Overwatch. Whereas once loot boxes were maligned as a microtransaction thanks to their random rewards, Blizzard is now citing the community demand as the reason behind their return.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">Overwatch 2 ditched loot boxes when it transformed from Overwatch 1 in 2022</a> and went free-to-play. Since then, fans have complained about a lack of rewards in Overwatch 2 compared to its predecessor, with the only real way to earn cosmetics for free coming from the free version of the game's battle pass or the occasional event. In the original Overwatch, players regularly earned loot boxes just by leveling up their account through playing, which was done away with for the sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes is just one of the surprises Blizzard had in store as part of its recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream. Also coming as part of Season 15 is the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks, gameplay-augmenting choices for each Overwatch 2 hero</a> that players will get to choose over the course of a match. Blizzard additionally detailed a new third-person, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based mode coming in Season 16 called Stadium that transforms Overwatch 2</a> into something closer to Valve's still unreleased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a> or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a>.</p>

This works out to 6 PM in London and 7 PM in Paris. For people on the other side of the world, Avowed arrives at 3 AM in Tokyo, 5 AM in Sydney, and 7 AM in Auckland on Friday, February 14.

                <p>Blizzard has big plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> in 2025, and one of them is a new mode that is unlike anything the game has seen before. Called Stadium, the mode is a competitive, round-based, third-person game mode where players upgrade their chosen hero over the course of a match using currency.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed as part of Blizzard's recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream, Stadium is intended to join Quick Play and Competitive as a new, third pillar of Overwatch 2 when it arrives as part of Season 16 later this year. The mode will only be playable as a ranked game mode with role queue, and matches will play out in a "best of seven" format. Overwatch's normal Control, Push, and Clash game modes will be featured in Stadium, and players will still be using Overwatch's colorful cast of heroes. That, however, is where the Overwatch 2 players may be accustomed to ends and in many ways a whole new game emerges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442716" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442716"></a><figcaption>Overwatch 2's Stadium mode will be played from a third-person perspective. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stadium will be the first game mode in Overwatch 2 to support a third-person camera, something recent hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> has used to great success. Players will, however, have the option to still play in first-person should they choose. The mode will feature a pre-round "buy" phase, where players can spend currency earned each round to purchase ability upgrades and stat-boosting items, MOBA-style. Items can do everything from granting players simple stat boosts like more health and faster movement speed all the way to granting attacks life-stealing or reducing the duration of negative effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Hero abilities can be augmented with currency too, granting them additional effects that can dramatically change the way a hero is played. Players will earn currency by killing enemies and earning assists, as well as a percentage of the damage and healing they do over the course of a round. There will also be a bounty system, where those who take out well-performing players on the enemy team will be rewarded with a currency payout.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, only 14 heroes in Overwatch 2's roster will be playable in Stadium mode "to ensure balance and competitive play," according to Blizzard. More heroes will be added to the mode over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442717" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442717"></a><figcaption>A look at the pre-round item shop where players can customize their hero with items and abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on what Blizzard has described and shown, it sounds as if Overwatch 2 is taking the pre-round buying phases of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a>, mashing it together with the third-person gameplay and MOBA-inspired item shop seen in Valve's still-in-the-works <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a>, and then combining it all with Overwatch to form a new game-within-a-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not the new mode catches on remains to be seen, but Stadium isn't the only major addition coming to Overwatch 2 in 2025. Blizzard additionally revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">loot boxes (originally removed when Overwatch went free-to-play</a> and transitioned into Overwatch 2) will be returning as part of Season 15 on February 18. The season will also introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">new gameplay system in the form of Perks</a>, where players will be able to choose between ability-altering bonuses over the course of a match. New heroes are coming too, with Blizzard giving fans a first look at the crossbow-wielding Freya and the monk-like Aqua.</p>

In a newly released video, Ubisoft has offered a glimpse of what Shadows has to offer on PC and new-gen systems, including uncapped framerates and some truly breathtaking visuals of the game's recreation of feudal Japan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2w3qSEBCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xs2w3qSEBCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Shadows' PC edition will feature an in-game benchmark that can determine the capabilities of the computer it's running on. Low-end and medium-end PC users won't be left out, as the game can be run in either low or high mode. But the more powerful computers will be able to handle ultra mode, which has stunning graphics.</p><p>Among the other features, Shadows includes ray-traced global illumination and reflections, dynamic seasons, and ultra-wide resolution support. However, some of the most fun may come out of the game's destructible environment. The sheer power of the samurai Yasuke can devastate everything around him, and even the ninja known as Naoe can leave a path of destruction in her wake.</p><p>Assassin's Creed creative director Jonathan Dumont recently indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-your-favored-main-character/1100-6529423/" data-ref-id="1100-6529423">Shadows will adapt if players favor Yasuke or Naoe</a> over the other, and most of the game's story can be experienced with either character. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-censored-in-japan/1100-6529030/" data-ref-id="1100-6529030">Japanese release has been censored by Ubisoft</a> because of the option to dismember enemy characters. But that feature can be turned on or off in other countries. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-accessibility-options-are-the-series-most-robust-yet/1100-6529024/" data-ref-id="1100-6529024">Shadows' also has robust accessibility options</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">an expansion</a>, which will be a preorder bonus rather than a standard DLC. However, the expansion will also be available for purchase at some point in the future.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be released on March 20 on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p>

                <p>There have been some rumblings in the past couple weeks that Fortnite would be collaborating with the Fast &amp; Furious movie franchise in the very near future--and those leaks took on a whole new meaning on Wednesday when we saw the very first teaser image for Chapter 6 Season 2, which showed a new version of Midas wearing Dominic Toretto's signature sleeveless black tee and gold chain--alongside a new season title, Lawless, and the launch date, February 21.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Lawless season starts very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg"></figure><p>You can see it there just the left of the season title--Midas Toretto right there on a wanted poster. It's an image that puts an entirely new spin on some recent leaks that had seemed pretty run-of-the-mill initially. Specifically, there were two leaks: that Dom's Dodge Charger <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1886129604877804000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would finally be ported</a> from Rocket League to Fortnite, and that Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Han Lue (Sung Kang) <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1888663806428975496" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would be getting skins</a>.</p><p>Since two Fast &amp; Furious cars were just brought over from Rocket League in the fall, it wasn't that big a deal to learn that others would follow. Rocket League has released five different Fast &amp; Furious cars over the years, and it only made sense to keep porting them. But the word that we'd be getting skins for Dom and Han made it clear that this stage of the Fast &amp; Furious collab would be a bigger deal--it indicated that Han's Mazda RX-7, also in Rocket League, could arrive imminently as well, for one thing. But now we have to also wonder if we might be getting one of these new character skins in the battle pass.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889"></a><figcaption>Dominic Toretto's signature look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg"></figure><p>This first official teaser, now, is only going to ramp up the speculation about whether this means that Chapter 6 Season 2 is an outright Fast &amp; Furious season. It's an exciting prospect for those who enjoy Fortnite's car-based gameplay, but it might inspire fear in the folks who detested last summer's divisive Wrecked season. But since the cars in Fast &amp; Furious are not usually weapon platforms, it's doubtful this car-based season would be quite as ridiculous as that one was.</p><p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts on Friday, February 21, and it's very gradually starting to come into focus as the big day inches closer and closer. We're tracking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">all the rumors and leaks about upcoming content in the new season right over here</a>, so you don't have to.</p>
