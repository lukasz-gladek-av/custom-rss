                <p>Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-showcase-coming-thursday-includes-brand-new-requiem-footage/1100-6537372/" data-ref-id="1100-6537372">Resident Evil Requiem Showcase</a> didn't reveal much about the story, but it did go into detail about how the game will change depending upon which character you're playing, and the title will also introduce new difficulty settings to the franchise. The new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, will represent a more classic, horror-focused approach to gameplay, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-2/" data-ref-id="5000-448874">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/" data-ref-id="5000-82753">6</a>. But when players are in control of Leon S. Kennedy, the tone of the game will shift to a more action-oriented style like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><p>It doesn't sound like players will get to choose which character they will control, since certain parts of the story are meant for one or the other. Although Grace is physically weaker than Leon, she will have some abilities to make up for that. She will be able to craft weapons using the blood of the infected. And when Grace needs to shoot her way out of trouble, she'll have a powerful gun called Requiem to fall back on. To keep players from relying only on Requiem, the ammo will be limited.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer (With Leon)</p>
      </div>
<p>RE Requiem is also introducing some new difficulty settings. The easiest mode is Casual, which lets players concentrate on the story and gives them an aim assist. Standard difficulty is a little harder, while Standard (Classic) won't let players save their games without finding a limited number of ink ribbons to use. That's a throwback to the save system in the older games in the franchise.</p><p>Another departure from the series' norms are more human-like zombies. Some of these poor lost creatures find themselves still working their dead-end jobs even after their death simply because their bodies remember how to do them. Players can sneak past some of these zombies or closely observe their actions for clues about how to proceed.</p><p>At least one of the infected zombies seen in the showcase was human enough to converse with Grace. It's unclear if that's simply a random zombie or a more important character to the narrative.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27.</p>

                <p>We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal</a> and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-reveals-hours-video-games-week.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported on by Medical Xpress</a>, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects "excessive gaming" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that "high gamers"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.</p><p>"What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight," Siervo said. "The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample."</p><p>(It's worth noting that 317 students across five universities in one country is an incredibly small sample size.)</p><p>Alongside "high gamers" (10+ hours per week), the researchers split the participants into "low gamers" (0–5 hours per week) and "moderate gamers" (5–10 hours), depending on the self-reported amount of time they spent playing video games. In these categories, the researchers found that high gamers experienced a decline in diet quality and an increase in obesity when compared to low and moderate gamers. For example, according to the study, high gamers had a median body mass index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m2 (generally considered overweight), compared to 22.2 kg/m2 and 22.8 kg/m2 (generally considered normal or healthy weight ranges) for low and moderate gamers, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, while all three groups reported generally poor sleep quality, moderate and high gamers scored worse here than low gamers, with their hours spent gaming being a significant disruptor to the quality of their sleep.</p><p>"Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors," Siervo explained in the findings. "This study doesn't prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors. Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly, and staying active."</p><p>It's not all bad, though. Siervo said that there's hope for young people whose college habits may carry over into their adulthood: change their behavior before the habit becomes an identity.</p><p>"Because university habits often follow people into adulthood," Siervo said. "Healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night, and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall well-being."</p><p>As for the rest of us? Well, the jury's still out.</p>
