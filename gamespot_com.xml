                <p>Earlier this month, WWE Raw--the weekly flagship show for the largest professional wrestling company in the world--made the switch from traditional TV to weekly streaming on Netflix. Today, the two companies announced the next chapter in their partnership, which will see the WWE 2K video game franchise come to mobile devices via the Netflix Games service later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement came via a brief teaser video featuring WWE Superstar CM Punk. No footage or additional details on the mobile version were provided--only that “WWE 2K games” would be coming to the service in “Fall 2025.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4436036-cmpunk.png" data-ref-id="1300-4436036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4436036-cmpunk.png" data-ref-id="1300-4436036"></a><figcaption>CM Punk in WWE 2K25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4436036-cmpunk.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This has been a busy week for the WWE 2K franchise, which also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/put-your-ones-up-for-the-wwe-2k25-cover-star-reveal/1100-6529047/" data-ref-id="1100-6529047">revealed Roman Reigns</a> as the cover athlete for WWE 2K25 on consoles and PC.

                <p dir="ltr">Developer BetaDwarf has announced its newest game, Vaultbreakers. Previously known under the codename "Project F4E," Vaultbreakers is described by its developer as a "hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG," and select players will be able to access a closed playtest at the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely," game director and BetaDwarf CEO Steffen Kabbelgaard said in a press release announcing the game. "With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgdcqiVQgA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">BetaDwarf also shared a reveal trailer, which shows Vaultbreakers' gameplay along with a cinematic animation. In it, two players are shown battling a pair of enemies. One player falls, while the other escapes through a portal, which serves as the game's extraction point.</p><p dir="ltr">"Many of us in the team love the extraction game's mechanics, but all of them are currently shooters," lead game designer Nikolaj Wendt said of the choice to blend extraction with a top-down ARPG. "Unfortunately, we are also very bad at shooters, but there wasn’t any alternative on the market, so we decided to make our own!”</p><p dir="ltr">A closed Vaultbreakers playtest encompassing the first and second chapters of the game's narrative campaign will begin on January 31. Players who want to get their hands on the current build can request access via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> or the <a href="http://vaultbreakers.com/" rel="nofollow ">official Vaultbreakers website</a>. Access keys will also be available through Twitch Drops from select content creators, and according to BetaDwarf, playtest participants will also earn Legacy Points, an in-game currency players can use to unlock rewards that will carry over to the game's final build when it officially launches.</p><p>Vaultbreakers' official release date has not yet been announced, but it's currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Project_F4E/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>
