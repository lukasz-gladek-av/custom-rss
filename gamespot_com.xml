                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars. While Microsoft has yet to elaborate on how the company will celebrate that milestone, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has indicated that 2026 will be "really special" for Xbox fans with returning franchises.</p><p>"When you think about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">Fable</a>, when you think about Gears, when you think about Forza, I mean, these are franchises that have been really part of what makes Xbox what it is today," said Spencer on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. "And it's going to be a nice lineup next year. I love the games that we've launched so far in [2025]. I think, as you already went through, we have a strong finish to 2025. And then when I look at [2026] and our 25th anniversary and the franchises that we're going to launch in that year, I think it's going to be a really special year for Xbox next year."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a> is one of the Xbox titles expected to arrive in 2026 alongside Fable and a new Forza game. Last fall, Microsoft shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">ambitious plans for the Halo franchise</a>, but it's unknown if a new title in the franchise will arrive in 2026. It's possible that another remake or remaster of the original Halo will be released next year.</p><p>Spencer's latest interview didn't mention whether next year's marquee Xbox titles will also be coming to PlayStation 5. The decision to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a> on Sony's console led to both games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topping the PSN charts in April</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>--which was published by Microsoft-owned Bethesda--also placed among PSN's top 20 titles for April, and DLC is coming later this year.</p><p>The original Xbox launched on November 15, 2001 in North America. Presumably Microsoft will disclose its anniversary plans before that date in 2026.</p>
