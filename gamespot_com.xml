                <p>The end of Diablo 4's Age of Hatred saga is nigh. Blizzard has officially announced the game's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, is coming April 28, 2026. The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto.</p><p>Revealed as part of 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius. In addition to finally taking us to these long-anticipated islands, Lord of Hatred also brings with it two new classes. While Blizzard has yet to reveal what one of these classes might be, they studio confirmed the fan-favorite Paladin is finally making their return.</p><p>"The Paladin rises as the realm darkens, wielding hammer, shield, and Holy Light to smite Mephisto’s demon army with righteous fury," Blizzard wrote in its press release. "Through melee combat and divine abilities, the Paladin empowers players to strike with both unwavering faith and overwhelming force."</p><p>Other changes to Diablo 4 coming with the next expansion include: reworked skill trees for all eight classes, a new loot filter, enhanced crafting systems, the return of the Horadric Cube, and an overhauled endgame "built around player choice, mastery, escalating challenge, and ever-more rewarding loot."</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png" data-ref-id="1300-4621493,1300-4621494,1300-4621495,1300-4621496,1300-4621497" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621493-paladin_zealot.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621494-paladin_judicator.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621495-paladin_disciple.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621496-paladin_juggernaut.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4621497-dia_x2_basiliskmount_paladin_005.png"></figure>

                <p>The Tomb Raider franchise is one of the most prolific and longest-running in all of gaming, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">we got a tease</a> of what's next for Lara Croft during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> on December 11. Surprisingly, there isn't just one game in production, but two. The new entry in the franchise is Tomb Raider: Catalyst, coming in 2027, while a total remake of the first title in the series arrives next year with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis.</p><p>Lara Croft's "Survivor" trilogy wrapped up in 2018 with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but fans have seen enough iterations of the hero to know this wasn't the end for Tomb Raider. Alongside a new game, the franchise is also coming to Prime Video with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-finds-another-actor-joining-sophie-turners-lara-croft/1100-6536605/">Sophie Turner starring as Croft</a>. Previously, the character has been played in live-action by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2yLZQFPSLo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N2yLZQFPSLo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sees Lara heading to Northern India, where a mythical cataclysm has taken place. This draws the attention of all sorts of treasure hunters, and Lara must figure out who's friend and foe. Developer Crystal Dynamics is behind the all-new entry in the franchise, which is planned for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis reimagines the original 1996 Tomb Raider. Crystal Dynamics is teaming up with Flying Wild Hog for the remake, which will utilize Unreal Engine 5 just like Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Similarly, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is set to come to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games will see actress Alix Wilton Regan portray Lara. She's previously provided performances for Cyberpunk 2077 and Mass Effect 3.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6JxVxSHjqE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

                <p>Like any awards show, there's bound to be a moment or two that leaves you perplexed about what's going on. The Game Awards had one such moment just like this, and it came during the reveal trailer for the upcoming Street Fighter film, which was quite chaotic and loud.</p><p>Moments after Geoff Keighley introduced the Street Fighter trailer, the film's main cast took to the stage. Andrew Koji (Ryu), Andrew Schulz (Dan Hibiki), Callina Liang (Chun-Li), Cody Rhodes (Guile), David Dastmalchian (M. Bison), Jason Momoa (Blanka), Mel Jarnson (Cammy), Noah Centineo (Ken Masters), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Orville Peck (Vega), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli), Roman Reigns (Akuma), and Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim) all took the stage to yap about ... nothing much, really.</p><p>That's not entirely true, sort of. Liang confirmed that the cast wrapped up filming Street Fighter "a few weeks ago." Momoa--with a slight sway and a slight slur--cheekily argued with Koji over the pronunciation of "Ryu." Koji said the cast was there to present the Best Ongoing Game Award (which Hello Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a> won). Schulz really sought applause by asking the audience to "make some noise" if they ever played the game in their life. Schulz, for some reason, then reignited the longstanding rivalry between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter by inviting "the whole cast of Mortal Kombat 2" onto the stage (which didn't happen).</p><p>After that, there was a brief moment of cheers and screams as the Street Fighter cast talked over each other. Wait, weren't they supposed to present the award for Best Ongoing Game? They remembered at the last minute when Koji refocused the uncoordinated cast. Centineo made a confused remark about "the mic not coming out of the floor" before announcing the award's winner. Hello Games took the stage, accepted the award, gave a speech, and walked off--everyone included.</p><p>After about five minutes of chaos and rambunctiousness, the moment ended, and the show continued as normal. It was odd, but nothing too out of the ordinary. If you remember a few years ago, the "Bill Clinton kid"--Matan Even--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/random-kid-arrested-after-appearing-on-stage-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509914/" data-ref-id="1100-6509914">snuck onto the stage before LAPD detained him</a>. While this ain't that, this is certainly just as confusing and just as weird as that moment back in December 2022.</p><p>We have a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7341"> collection of the biggest announcements</a> from the livestream. There's a lot to dig through, so be sure to bookmark the post to keep up with the reveals and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">awards</a>.</p>
