Riot Games, meanwhile, has been working on a tag fighter of its own in 2XKO, and today the team has a new update for its League of Legends fighting game: A closed beta test is set to begin in September, and it will include a new roster member in Vi, the star of Arcane: A League Of Legends Story.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2XKO closed beta will begin September 9 on PC, with Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 versions to follow "at a later date." The beta will feature cross-progression, however, which will allow players who prefer consoles to transfer their progress to the console of their choice with "no lapse in progress or inventory."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4536365-2xko_vikeyart-7_22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4536365" data-ratio="1.25" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4536365-2xko_vikeyart-7_22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4536365"></a><figcaption>Vi, as seen in 2XKO.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4536365-2xko_vikeyart-7_22.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The closed beta will also introduce Vi--the fiery pugilist LoL champion and star of the Netflix series Arcane: A League of Legends Story--as the eighth member of the playable roster.

                <p>Supermassive Games has announced another round of layoffs and has delayed its next Dark Pictures game. In a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement shared on social media</a>, Supermassive said it's cutting staff against the backdrop of a "challenging and ever-evolving environment" in the video game industry.</p><p>"As we adapt our team structure to better align with these changes, we've had to make the very difficult decision to begin a redundancy consultation process where we anticipate losing up to 36 of our colleagues," Supermassive said. "This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to those affected."</p><p>The restructure has "no impact" on the making of Little Nightmares III, Supermassive said, but the same cannot be said for Directive 8020, which is the latest entry in Supermassive's The Dark Pictures Anthology.</p><p>"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p>Supermassive Games is owned by Nordisk Games, which also owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios.</p><p>Supermassive Games previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-games-is-cutting-jobs/1100-6521363/" data-ref-id="1100-6521363">cut jobs in February 2024</a> with up to 150 positions impacted. Numerous video game companies have laid off staff in recent times, including Microsoft. The Xbox company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">recently laid off staff, canceled games, and closed at least one studio outright. </a></p><p>Directive 8020 is a survival-horror game starring Lashana Lynch, who is known for her roles in the James Bond movie No Time To Die and in the MCU for playing Maria Rambeau.</p>
