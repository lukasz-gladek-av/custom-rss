                <p>Amidst Xbox's multiplatform publishing strategy, Sony is reiterating its commitment to prioritizing the PlayStation 5. During a recent <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony business meeting</a> and "fireside chat," PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company is taking a "very measured, very deliberate approach" when it comes to deciding if and when a first-party title appears on other platforms like PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony has been porting many of its marquee titles to PC for years. Some of its more recent live-service titles, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> and the short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a>, released day-and-date on console and PC, while tentpole single-player games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> typically release on PS5 first and arrive at least a year later on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about the industry's move towards multiplatform titles and how Sony is looking to protect the "value" of the PS5 console, Hulst indicated that Sony isn't looking to change its current strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's important to realize that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that," Hulst said. "Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that Sony's first-party titles are meant to be a showcase for the PS5 hardware, and that the company wants players to "get the best experience" from these titles playing on PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're very thoughtful about how and if and how we bring these titles to other platforms," Hulst said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an approach that appears to be working, even as Microsoft doubles down on its multiplatform game strategy of releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">Xbox titles on PS5 with positive results</a>. When asked about Microsoft's strategy and whether or not it's a good thing, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino said he believed competition in the industry is good and creates innovation, but that Sony is "confident and committed to our current strategy."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to discussing how its approaching platform exclusivity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Sony reiterated its commitment to live-service titles</a>, with Hulst stating he doesn't believe Bungie's upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a> will suffer the same fate as Concord.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is shaking things up with its new strategy of launching its own games on rival platforms, and now Sony has reacted to Microsoft's latest moves. As part of an<a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> investor fireside chat</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was asked to respond to speculation from investors that Microsoft is "moving away from the console."</p><p>To be clear, Microsoft has made no announcements about moving away from building hardware, and in fact, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already said it's working on its next console</a>. In any event, Nishino responded by saying Microsoft trying something new and creating an additional competitive element in the gaming landscape by launching more of its games on rival systems is "healthy and pushes us to innovate."</p><p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall game industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said. "However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy, and there isn't an urgent need for us to pivot. We will continue to monitor play patterns and invest appropriately as required."</p><p>The next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-how-to-get-in-whats-in-it-start-times-and-more/1100-6532379/" data-ref-id="1100-6532379">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, which debuts in August, representing the first time the Gears franchise will be available outside of Xbox and PC. Microsoft recently launched Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation, and the company's biggest series, Call of Duty, is developed for both Xbox and PlayStation systems.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox platform is understood to be the lowest-selling of the main three when compared against Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch devices. Microsoft is no longer pushing Xbox hardware as much as it once was, as it's rolled out a new marketing campaign saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">you don't need to buy an Xbox</a> because many of the products you may already own can play Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles make money, but games and services are more lucrative. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream. Bringing Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo devices is another way Microsoft can make more money as well.</p><p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">time and again repeated his comments that Xbox is a business</a>, and his job is to grow that business, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">even if it means laying people off, closing studios, and cancelling games. </a></p><p>Also during the presentation, Sony management <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/" data-ref-id="1100-6532420">briefly discussed the PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-doesnt-sound-too-concerned-about-switch-2-even-after-a-record-breaking-debut/1100-6532425/" data-ref-id="1100-6532425">responded to the record-breaking launch of the Switch 2.</a> Sony also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-playstations-current-pc-port-strategy-to-change-anytime-soon/1100-6532428/" data-ref-id="1100-6532428">discussed its strategy for PC releases.</a></p>

                <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> could carry forward a feature from GTA 5 with famous real-world artists getting their own in-game radio stations. Rapper Jermaine Dupri said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zt-XrrNg&amp;t=399s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rory and Mal</a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/drake-will-have-his-own-radio-station-in-gta-6-according-to-fellow-rapper-3214593/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's heard that hugely popular rapper Drake "got his own radio station in Grand Theft Auto."</p><p>Dupri didn't mention GTA 6 by name, but Drake has never had a radio station in the GTA series before, so it's assumed he was talking about the new game due out next year. Dupri himself said he was asked as well to "do Grand Theft Auto," but he didn't elaborate on if he signed on or not.</p>

<p>Dupri went on to say that GTA 6's Drake radio station will give Drake the ability to upload music that no one has ever heard before, suggesting artists might debut new music inside GTA 6. In addition to Drake, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-have-dj-khaled-in-game-radio-station-report/1100-6529567/" data-ref-id="1100-6529567">DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6 as well.</a></p><p>Drake has a connection to Miami, which is a stand-in for GTA 6's Vice City. The music video for his song "God's Plan" was filmed in Miami, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/drake-donates-175k-gods-plan-music-video" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Drake gave out more than $175,000 to Miami locals.</a> DJ Khaled, meanwhile, got his start in the music business in Miami.</p><p>In GTA 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean had his own in-game radio station</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">GTA 4 had a radio station hosted by the late Roy Ayers</a>. Music has long been a major component of the GTA series, and that's expected to continue with GTA 6.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-fan-theories/2900-6585/" data-ref-id="2900-6585">popular theory</a> is that music in GTA 6 won't be limited to when you're in a car. The character Lucia is seen wearing headphones in some GTA 6 images, prompting theories that players will be able to listen to music while they're walking down the street.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally set to launch this year before being delayed so the developers at Rockstar Games could refine and improve the experience for launch.</p>

                <p>Sony's PS5 console will turn five years old in November, and with an eye on the future, the company recently revealed its thoughts on what's next for PlayStation. During a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" rel="nofollow ">business presentation</a> hosted by several top Sony executives, president and CEO Hideaki Nishino responded to a query about future PlayStation hardware and if a next-gen PS6 console was even necessary when cloud gaming has improved over the years.</p><p>According to Nishino, while cloud gaming is "progressing well from a technical standpoint," certain challenging aspects like end-to-end network stability remain out of Sony's control. Nishino added that cloud-based gameplay is still a viable option for gamers and allows them to access more content, but the "local execution" of games--via physical media or content downloaded directly to console hardware--remains in high demand by the majority of PlayStation gamers.</p>

      </div>
<p>"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p>On the topic of the next-gen PlayStation console, Nishino remained tight-lipped. "Our console business has evolved into a multi-faceted platform, and we now have a large ecosystem of highly engaged players across both the PS5 and PS4 generations, so naturally, there's a huge interest in our next-generation console strategy," Nishino said. "While we cannot share further details at this stage, the future of the platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services."</p><p>What we do know about the PS6 is that it likely won't be out for quite a while yet. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">if the next PlayStation comes out in 2028</a>, that would feel right to him, given how current console generations typically run for around seven years now.</p><p>In 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/">Intel made a big push to produce chips for the PS6</a>, but Sony decided to stick with AMD. While PlayStation gamers will be in for a long wait, Sony did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/">mid-gen PS5 refresh last year in the form of the PS5 Pro</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As reported by IGN</a>, Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but he maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>Hulst said Sony now has a "much more rigorous process" in place for "validating" the company's hypotheses as it relates to a game's creative and commercial possibilities.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p><p>Marathon is slated for release on September 23. Some theorized it could be delayed, but it remains on track, at least as of now.</p><p>In regards to Sony's live-service plans in general, Hulst said the company is "very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live-service portfolio."</p><p>In related news, it was confirmed this week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-off-30-of-days-gone-developer-bend-studio-after-canceling-live-service-game/1100-6532332/" data-ref-id="1100-6532332">Sony cut staff at the studio behind Days Gone after cancelling a live-service game at the studio.</a> Before this, Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service God of War title</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">developer Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online</a> back in 2023. Recently, it was reported that Sony's multiplayer heist game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">Fairgame$ was reportedly pushed to 2026 following concerns</a>.</p>
