This means bosses, NPCs, points of interest, and items will be added to the game from Star Wars and the battle pass will be Star Wars-themed. Loolo said that the battle pass will feature four to five skins, although it's unclear if all of them will be Star Wars skins or if only some of them.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904931282011758877" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: SEASON 3 IS STAR WARS THEMED! ðŸ‘€ðŸ”¥</p><p>With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@X0X_LEAK</a>, I can confirm that season 3 is Star Wars themed, with it lasting aprox. 30 days!</p><p>We will get new Star Wars bosses, NPCs, POIs, items, and more!

This is the same time of year Fortnite has had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-at-the-most-obvious-time/1100-6522651/">Star Wars events in the past</a>. Fortnite also has tons of Star Wars cosmetics already, including Anakin, Luke, Leia, Darth Vader, Storm Troopers, and more, making it difficult to predict which characters might be getting skins in the upcoming season, especially with the possibility that there could be different outfits for characters that have already appeared.</p><p>Disney and Fortnite have collaborated for themed seasons in the past, including multiple Marvel seasons. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/">Disney also invested $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a> in 2024, with plans to build a persistent Disney universe with the Fortnite developer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-season-3-release-date-battle-pass-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6530296/">Season 3 of Fortnite OG</a> just kicked off as well, bringing back the old map and adding a battle pass featuring remixed versions of old skins.</p>

                <p>The DEA has Schedule 1 drugs, substances, or chemicals defined as "drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." It shares the name with a new game that's blowing up the charts on Steam and players can dive into early access now.</p><p>In Schedule 1, you take the role of a small-time drug dealer rolling into a new city with no cash, no product, and no hookups or clients. The game's objective is to build your drug empire from the ground up as you contend against law enforcement and rival deadly cartel members so you can expand your empire and become a drug kingpin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUxiQ1qN0rg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released just yesterday, Schedule 1 quickly climbed to the top of the charts of not only Trending Games, but also Popular Releases, and Hot Releases on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The game even reached 116,408 concurrent first-day players--almost <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/" data-ref-id="1100-6530301">double that of Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>. It reached a new high today with over 131,000.</p><p>Some players might remember playing Drug Wars on their TI-86 in high school, and at its foundation, Schedule 1 seems similar in that aspect. However, Schedule 1 also has multiplayer capabilities that help you take your empire to greater heights. The game even breaks down your drug-making process to include monitoring lighting, growth, and even when to harvest your plants for the best product possible.</p><p>Schedule 1 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently on sale</a> and players who buy now will have early access until March 31, when the price will go back up by 25-50% afterwards.</p>

                <p>Communications Workers of America announced on March 25 that user-research workers at Activision have voted to form a union that Microsoft is already willing to recognize.</p><p>Officially called Activision User Research Union-CWA, this is the first video-game-researcher union of its kind in the North American video game industry. A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/activision-user-research-workers-overwhelmingly-vote-form-union-cwa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> about the union's formation explains that it wants to fight for better wages and job security for those working in user research at the Call of Duty maker.</p><p>The massive number of layoffs the video game industry has seen over the past couple of years was also cited as a reason for the union's formation. Organizing Committee member Pat Dimaandal argues that "workers should not feel punished for pursuing a career that they love, and thatâ€™s why weâ€™re organizing toward long-term, sustainable careers in this industry."</p><p>The CWA confirms that there are now over 2,000 unionized workers at Microsoft-owned studios after the formation of this union. Unionization efforts began at Activision several years ago in the wake of the Civil Rights lawsuit against Activision Blizzard. Raven Software was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-accepts-raven-software-qas-union-set-to-begin-negotiations/1100-6504416/" data-ref-id="1100-6504416">first studio to unionize</a>, and Microsoft had to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/06/13/microsoft-union-activision-blizzard-cwa/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agree to allow unionization efforts</a> at its studios during the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard. That opened the door to unions like this one and others at Microsoft-owned companies like ZeniMax Online.</p><p>CWA recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/industrywide-video-game-union-announced-open-to-anyone-in-the-business/1100-6530209/" data-ref-id="1100-6530209">announced the United Videogame Workers-CWA union</a> at GDC 2025 for those not working at a company like Microsoft. UVW-CWA is an industry-wide union that any game developer can join, and the CWA has confirmed it has already gotten over 350 members since it was announced last week.</p>
