Dressed to kill, this Operator is being released to promote the new entry in the horror film franchise. "Last summer, they know what you did. This summer, the Fisherman's in your lobby," the message reads for the brief teaser trailer.</p><p>While it doesn't have a number attached to it, I Know What You Did Last Summer is the fourth film in the slasher series, and it's a direct sequel to 1998's I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Set 27 years after the Tower Bay murders, the movie features a new hook-wielding killer on the loose targeting a group of friends, one year after they covered up a car crash in which they may have killed someone. The movie premiered on July 18 to mixed reviews, and so far, it has scared up a worldwide box office gross of $24.6 million.</p><p>A release date for Fisherman--who bears a striking resemblance to the <a href="https://youtu.be/vgIY_U6Npxg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hash-Slinging Slasher</a> from SpongeBob SquarePants--has not been announced, but they are expected to debut in Season Five of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This new reveal follows hot on the heels of several surprising crossovers in the game, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/" data-ref-id="1100-6533245">American Dad</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis &amp; Butt-Head</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">Eve Macarro from the John Wick spin-off Ballerina</a> have all been added in recent weeks.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-now-asking-players-to-verify-their-age/1100-6533243/" data-ref-id="1100-6533243">a new age-verification measure is being added</a>, and Treyarch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was recently announced with a slick trailer.</p>
