          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">With marquee franchises ranging from grand adventures like The Legend of Zelda to niche series like Metroid, few video game publishers have a stable of properties as extensive and varied as Nintendo. But though many of these franchises are regularly supported with new installments, many more have been left languishing in dormancy--and among them, few are as frequently clamored for as F-Zero. Despite the ongoing wait for a new title, however, the futuristic racing series has actually been experiencing something of a quiet resurgence over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">This revival began in earnest in 2023 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/f-zero-99-announced-available-today/1100-6517727/">surprise release</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-99/" data-ref-id="5000-603158">F-Zero 99</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-battle-royale-games/2900-6531/">battle royale</a>-style twist on the original F-Zero offered as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tetris-99/" data-ref-id="5000-493304">Tetris 99</a> (and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-99-will-shut-down-this-october/1100-6514261/">short-lived Pac-Man 99</a>) before it, F-Zero 99 invigorates the series' classic formula by exploding the player count, with 99 competitors all vying for first place. But whereas Tetris 99 is a battle of attrition, a grueling contest to whittle down and outlast the competition, F-Zero 99 is still very much a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-racing-games/2900-5482/">racing game</a> at heart; unlike other battle royale-type games, your objective is not to eliminate other players (although it is greatly encouraged, as doing so replenishes your health meter), but to outmaneuver them over the course of four laps. The increased player count makes these high-speed contests even more nerve-wracking, and the difference between success and failure is often measured in milliseconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502165"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502165-5775360847-7a016a000e495ee5aa915e223945d8fe0d117a61dd19c76d1a2a8187d1edbda7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The result is exhilarating. Though it may not be an entirely new entry, F-Zero 99 is a refreshing spin on the series, one that offers a tantalizing glimpse at a potential path forward for future installments. The expanded player count amplifies the high-stakes thrills of F-Zero's best moments--of negotiating winding, hazard-laden tracks and hairpin turns at lightning speed as other vehicles ricochet and explode all around you. More importantly, the game stands as proof that, contrary to what disgruntled fans may claim, Nintendo has neither forgotten about nor abandoned F-Zero.</p><p dir="ltr">Since 99's release, Nintendo has put out a steady cadence of F-Zero content on the Switch, keeping the franchise consistently in the public eye. 99 itself continues to hold regular in-game events and receive periodic updates, including one that recently added courses and other content from the long-lost <a href="https://fzero.fandom.com/wiki/BS_F-Zero_Grand_Prix" rel="nofollow ">BS F-Zero game</a> for Super Famicom's Satellaview attachment. The company also dug three classic F-Zero titles out from its vaults and brought them to Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library over the course of 2024. GBA launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-maximum-velocity/" data-ref-id="5000-3277">Maximum Velocity</a> hit the service in March, while anime tie-in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gp-legend/" data-ref-id="5000-19983">GP Legend</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-climax/" data-ref-id="5000-21316">F-Zero Climax</a>, both followed in October.</p><p dir="ltr">The last title in particular is one of the most noteworthy additions to the service. Not only was Climax the final F-Zero game released for Game Boy Advance, arriving near the end of the handheld's life in 2004, it effectively marked the end of the series. Released in quick succession after GP Legend (which itself launched only a few months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gx/" data-ref-id="5000-4377">F-Zero GX</a> on GameCube), Climax was the third F-Zero game in the span of two years, which significantly diminished its impact. This was borne out in the poor reception it received, reportedly selling a scant 5,000 copies in its first three days. As a result, it would be the last brand-new F-Zero game that Nintendo released before putting the series into hibernation--and would remain as such for nearly 20 years, until the aforementioned F-Zero 99 arrived.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxqYOmjPWF0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VxqYOmjPWF0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">More notably, Climax was originally never released outside of Japan. Faced with the series' dwindling sales, Nintendo elected not to bring the game to other markets, making its arrival on the Switch Online service the first official chance many F-Zero fans around the world have had to experience this lost entry. But though it may not have garnered much attention on its original release, F-Zero Climax arguably stands as the pinnacle of the series' 2D design, with refined racing mechanics, impressive visuals, and even a course customization tool (which is even more enjoyable to tinker with now, thanks to the ease with which custom tracks can be shared online). In a way, this long-overdue release ended up working to the game's benefit, as Climax arrives at a time when players are much more receptive to--and eager for--F-Zero content.</p><p dir="ltr">It's tempting to think these re-releases merely served as an easy way for Nintendo to buoy the original Switch as it has shifted its resources and attention to the upcoming Switch 2, but the F-Zero series will also play a pivotal role in the new console's launch. From the moment the system hits the market, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers will have access to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">library of classic GameCube games</a> on it--and tellingly, one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">first three titles</a> playable on the service right at the outset will be F-Zero GX.</p><p dir="ltr">This is notable for a number of reasons, not least because it will mark the first time the game will be officially available in more than 20 years. F-Zero GX is widely regarded as the series' finest installment, and it makes a compelling showpiece for Nintendo's new system. Thanks to the increased resolution Switch 2 offers, the game's neon-tinged visuals remain sharp and vibrant even two decades on, and the addition of online play greatly enriches its appeal. Moreover, GX's arrival means the entire F-Zero franchise (with the exception of obscurities like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit) will be playable on Switch 2 right from day one, giving longtime fans and newcomers access to the whole series on a single platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502259"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4502259-8730467379-36bbcf1160028ffe860ef9cf9a76bd470f6e2f9d7ec09315aad4de3e6d1e1383.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, that isn't the only way F-Zero is helping usher the new platform to market. F-Zero 99 also makes an appearance in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-ad-brings-back-paul-rudd-decades-after-his-snes-commercial/1100-6530992/">Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd</a>. Although the ad primarily showcases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and Switch 2's GameChat feature, F-Zero 99 is prominently visible on the system's home menu near the beginning of the spot, which is likely the most mainstream exposure the game has ever received. Of course, it's easy to infer why 99 was included. The new ad deliberately harkens back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYhGL5y4DPQ">1991 SNES commercial</a> Rudd appeared in, which spotlighted the original F-Zero among several other SNES titles. 99's appearance brings the commercials full circle, but it's nonetheless a good sign to see it promoted (however briefly) as part of such a pivotal marketing campaign.</p><p>Between these re-releases and updates, F-Zero is in a more prominent position than it's been in many years, which bodes well for the series' future. Nintendo has been steadily laying the groundwork for a potential revival, using the free F-Zero 99 and a regular drip of legacy titles to gauge fan interest and introduce the franchise to a new generation of players. For all the criticism the company deserves over its conservative tendencies, Nintendo is often willing to give some of its lesser-known properties another chance, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-mans-final-chapters-are-a-masterclass-in-suspense/1100-6528480/">recent revival of Famicom Detective Club</a>. If a series that obscure can receive a new entry, there's hope yet for a new F-Zero.</p>

Multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kwee87/gearing_up/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">images</a> and videos (some of which were pulled as this article was written) circulating online show what appear to be Switch 2 systems in stores and even potentially already at home with some users.</p><p>But the systems may nothing more than paperweights for now, as the Switch 2 is said to be unable to be used without a day-one mandatory online update.

The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>.

                <p>It's a big day for Ubisoft's The Division 2, as the game has joined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> library alongside the debut of its new expansion, Battle for Brooklyn.</p><p>The Division 2 is available via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. People who subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate get a perk in the form of the free EMS outfit, which itself includes five EMS-themed items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S65EIG8H3Z4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S65EIG8H3Z4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Division 2 comes to Game Pass just as the game's seventh year of live service begins with the Year 7 Crossroads update. This season is all about nostalgia, with new modifiers and gear that are callbacks to the original The Division, Ubisoft said. Year 7 also includes a range of quality-of-life improvements, including better onboarding for new players.</p><p>The Division 2 is also included in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/" data-ref-id="1100-6531805">PlayStation Plus Extra catalog</a>, while Ubisoft+ subscribers can get it through their membership as well.</p><p>Additionally, the Battle for Brooklyn expansion is out now, taking players to Brooklyn as part of a "brand-new linear campaign." The campaign can be completed solo or in co-op, and the story involves learning how the Cleaners have cooked up their dangerous Purple Flame weapon.</p><p>Everyone who buys the $15 Battle for Brooklyn expansion gets an automatic level-40 boost, along with the DLC-exclusive Catalyst Exotic mask that provides special in-game bonuses. Battle for Brooklyn is also included in The Division 2's Gold and Ultimate editions.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year.</p>
