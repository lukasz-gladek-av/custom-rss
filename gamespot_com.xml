                <p>For anyone who has ever watched an Indiana Jones movie, there's no question about where the title character stands on Nazis. He's been punching them in the face ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark hit theaters in 1981. Nazis have also been recurring villains in two of the four films that followed. But Bethesda's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will further emphasis the franchise's anti-Nazi stance with an in-game statement.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-includes-warning-denouncing-nazis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, The Great Circle's developer, MachineGames, added the following disclaimer: "The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity."</p><p>This statement comes amidst <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-scholz-says-dark-neo-nazi-networks-are-rise-2024-01-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a resurgence in neo-Nazi activity</a>, in both Europe and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/27/neonazis-ai-hitler-videos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in America</a>. The Indiana Jones movies have never really dealt with the weightier real-world implications of the Nazi atrocities, and the game will follow in those footsteps with some history mixed with fantasy elements. But rest assured, Dr. Jones will be dealing with the game's Nazis in the same way he's always done for the last 43 years.</p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>

At last, the joys of Ghost Huntin' are available to all.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia--which launched in September 2020 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-winners-and-game-of-the-year/1100-6485360/">took home the award for Best Debut Game</a> just three months later--now features cross-play in addition to console compatibility, meaning players can face the paranormal (or run screaming from it) with friends on any platform. The console launch comes alongside a new game update called the Crimson Eye, which is available now for all platforms, and features everything from the return of a heart-stopping seasonal event to bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="517860564" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

This year, the Blood Moon is back and bigger than ever," the game's website explains in <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post</a>. "Paranormal energy has drastically increased in several locations, resulting in a new weather type, The Blood Moon. Enter these cursed locations and complete investigations, optional objectives and photograph any Blood Altars you may find to earn Blood Points. Work together with the Ghost Huntin' Community to collect Blood Points and earn brand-new rewards. Be warned, during the Blood Moon, ghosts will be empowered and stronger than ever."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post noted that accessing Blood Moon (and all "future seasonal or temporary events") will require an online connection, even when playing solo. This is due to the fact that temporary in-game events bring with them "a lot of technical changes," so keeping players online when interacting with live/seasonal events "will allow [Kinetic Games] to keep track of the event progress and make live changes on our cloud servers, if needed."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crimson Eye update also adds an Event Board to the Warehouse. The Event Board features "leaflets for current in-game events and challenges," which allow players to individually track their progress for each event they're taking part in. The game's photo cork board has been moved to the truck parked inside the Warehouse to make room for the Event Board, which is located between the truck and the Warehouse's door. The Event Board currently features two new challenges: Ranger Challenge and Sunny Meadows Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Other improvements include a physics upgrade that makes doors <em>much</em> less frustrating. Moving doors can no longer push players out of the way (great for those moments when one's teammates can't seem to decide if they're coming or going), and doors can no longer be pulled off their hinges. Additionally, players can no longer be pushed through walls or other solid objects, and players suffering low frame rates can finally cross "accidentally clipping through the floor of Point Hope" off their list of totally rational fears, as the floor has evidently been reinforced with low-FPS-proof wood.</p><p>Phasmophobia's Crimson Eye update patch notes are listed in full below. For more info on the creepy co-op (which is still technically in early-access) and its hair-raising scare tactics, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-phasmophobia-to-be-so-terrifying-the-devil-is-in-the-details/1100-6527456/">our interview with Phamophobia's dev team</a>.

                <p>It seems like Arachnophobia--the fear of spiders--is becoming more prevalent in the video game realm. Earlier this year, BioWare confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fear-not-dragon-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-0-spiders/1100-6527078/" data-ref-id="1100-6527078">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is completely spider-free</a> despite the eight-legged arachnids' presence in the series' previous titles. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been revealed to include spiders, but it has an option to replace them entirely.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-preloading-is-live-for-some-but-finding-it-is-tricky/1100-6527422/" data-ref-id="1100-6527422">Monster Hunter Wilds beta has launched</a>, and as reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-features-an-accessibility-mode-for-players-who-fear-spiders-and-insects/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, sharp-eyed players have noticed that it has an Arachnophobia Assistance feature. There are spiders in the game, including some giant spiders that may prove to be challenging boss fights. But once the Arachnophobia Assistance feature is turned on, all of those spiders will be gone.</p><p>However, that doesn't get the players off the hook for those battles. It only means that the spiders will be replaced by something else. For example, the common spiders in the game will become blob-like slime creatures that are just as difficult to fight as the spiders. Presumably the giant spiders will also be transformed when they appear in the game as well.</p><p>Not every gamer suffers from Arachnophobia, and some may even enjoy the chance to battle against the arachnids in the game. But perhaps the sight of realistically rendered spiders--complete with hairy legs and multiple eyes--may be too much for some players. Either way, the players get to decide whether they want to cathartically face those fears or simply pretend that the creatures aren't there with the flip of a switch.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28, 2025. PS Plus subscribers currently have early access to the beta, which will expand to non-subscribers on PS5 on October 31, the same day the beta launches for PC and Xbox Series X|S. But the beta will only last until November 3.</p>

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rise of Ronin</a> is also a 20-plus hour adventure, but this action game leans more into the role-playing genre with its systems. It earned a 7/10 in GameSpot's Rise of the Ronin review.</p><p>With a fast-paced combat system benefitted by a nice variety of abilities and weapons and an engaging story filled with interesting characters, Rise of the Ronin is a solid choice for action-RPG enthusiasts--as long as you're willing to put some time into it without giving up. It doesn't have a strong opening, and the combat system has a rather steep learning curve. And like many open-world games, there's a fair amount of repetition in both the environments and mission structures. But a 7/10 is the type of game that really benefits from a nice discount, as it's less of a gamble when it costs $40 instead of $70.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Available Ahead Of This Week's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/targets-exclusive-shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-is-discounted-just-weeks-after-its-release/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-and-peach-starter-sets-get-first-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">New Lego Super Mario And Peach Starter Sets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-movie-tv-series-box-set-collection-amazon-halloween-deals/1100-6527353/">Best Horror Movie 4K Box Sets And Steelbook Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-limited-time-amazon-deals-all-6-dune-books-for-38-4k-box-set-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6527343/">Dune Limited-Time Amazon Deals - All 6 Dune Books For $38, 4K Box Set For Lowest Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Sony has <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it has shut down Firewalk Studios, the developer behind the multiplayer-shooter game Concord. Additionally, Concord has been permanently sunset, dashing any hopes of a revival.</p><p>"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," Sony said in a statement. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p><p>Sony has also closed down Neon Koi, a mobile studio that was working on an action game that will no longer be moving forward. Neon Koi was previously known as Savage Game Studios and it was acquired by Sony in 2022.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/playstation-shutters-studio-behind-concord-video-game-flop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, 210 employees will be impacted, with 172 from Firewalk and 38 from Neon Koi losing their jobs.</p><p>Last month, Concord director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concords-future-remains-unclear-director-steps-down-into-support-role-report/1100-6526592/" data-ref-id="1100-6526592">reportedly stepped down</a> to a support role while the future of Firewalk remained unclear. Employees were reportedly pitching future projects while others were anticipating layoffs and preparing their portfolios. Sony already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">suffered a round of layoffs</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Concord launched on August 23 for PS5 and PC, but was taken offline on September 6 due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/" data-ref-id="1100-6526101">low player count</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">reportedly low sales</a>. There were hopes from players and fans that Concord could make a comeback in another form, such as going free-to-play, but now Sony has confirmed that the game will not be coming back. This marks the latest in a devastating series of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">mass layoffs</a> and studio closures throughout the games industry.</p>
