                <p>Fans of cooperative climbing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> know that ticks aren't the only bug in the game, and for the last week they've been subject to a particularly frustrating one that developers are now aware of and working to resolve: the brand new biome, the Mesa, has been missing for the last week, with only the original Alpine biome showing up in the game's seed-generated maps.</p><p>"For the last 7 days, every map has had the ALPINE," developer Team Peak wrote in a post on the game's Steam page. "Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>. The game has been a hit on Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">since June</a>, and Geoff Keighley confirmed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/" data-ref-id="2900-6888">Opening Night Live</a> that the game has sold 10 million copies since launch.</p>

                <p>Sony recently announced a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBA 2K26 PS5 Slim Bundle</a> is set to arrive on September 5. As the name implies, this will include the PS5 Slim model with a disc drive, a DualSense controller, and the upcoming NBA 2K26. It's arriving on September 5, the same day NBA 2K26 launches on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We're still waiting on pricing details for the new bundle, but considering Sony <strong>increased the PS5's price on August 21</strong>, we're expecting it to be more expensive than previous bundles. Still, bundles like this are always popular, so set a reminder for September 5 if you're thinking about picking one up.</p><div title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4175" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">Pricing TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle pulls together a PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Controller, and a digital voucher for NBA 2K26. It's unclear what format the game is--tough judging by previous bundles, we expect it will be a digial code.</p><p>The bigger question is price. The base PS5 Slim now costs $550 (was $500) and PS5 Slim Digital costs $500 (was $450--and before that was $400 at launch), we're expecting this to be pricier than previous bundles. For example, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases/1100-6534138/" data-ref-id="1100-6534138">PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle</a> was previously available for just $400, offering a value of $570. The bundle didn't last long at that promotional price, and we'd expect this upcoming NBA 2K26 bundle to be much more expensive. At the very least, we're hoping the bundle ends up being cheaper than buying everything individually. Expect to learn more as we quickly approach its September 5 release date. Availability of the bundle will vary by region. Most markets should find it on PlayStation Direct, though other local retailers may also have inventory.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're worried about pricing--or don't need NBA 2K26, consider grabbing a PS5 at Amazon. The online retailer still offers all three PS5 models at their previous price points--meaning you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim</a> for $500, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim Digital</a> for $450, or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Pro for $700</a>.

                <p>Besides creating many iconic cult movies like Halloween, The Thing, and Escape From New York, you may also be aware that filmmaker John Carpenter is an ardent fan of video games. Has he then finally decided to make one? Well, yes and no. Toxic Commando may bear his name in the title, but the real credit goes to developer and publisher Saber Interactive. Still, after playing this apocalyptic co-op first-person shooter for the first time at Gamescom 2025, I see how it bears his influence. This isn't just a cynical marketing stunt to put his name on the box.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to kind of tap into those '80s horror and over-the-top action films like Big Trouble in Little China, so we reached out to Carpenter, who was like, 'Yeah, this is great,'" said Saber's chief creative officer, Tim Willits. "He's played the game with us, he's helped with some concepts, he's been good about saying, 'Focus on these types of things when you tell this type of story.'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDfS-wDsmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahDfS-wDsmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It may be more accurate to describe Carpenter as having more of a consulting role rather than being deeply involved in development. But his role is also more hands-on at least in some areas: The director famously composed some of the themes for his own influential movies, and has written music that will be incorporated into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While not directly referencing Carpenter's back catalog, the story of Toxic Commando, about a corporation seeking a new limitless power source that unwittingly awakens an evil entity, is totally the kind of idea I can imagine he might have conceived of in the peak of his filmmaking career--this evil is even named the Sludge God, which is as unapologetically B-movie as it gets.</p><p dir="ltr">Our four-player session was less focused on the story than it was on just diving into the gameplay itself. Willits recommends the best way to catch up on the backstory is through the comic book prequels Saber has produced in partnership with Dark Horse Comics.</p><p dir="ltr">"The story is very fun and quirky, but it does not get in the way," he said, though those who do want to get immersed in the story can also opt to solo the game with computer-controlled bots as teammates. That should provide a better way to appreciate the moment-to-moment chatter with the other titular commandos--the laid-back Walter, the nihilistic Ruby, the empathetic Cato, and the natural leader Astrid--each played by small-screen actors whose likenesses have also been faithfully rendered in-game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a session cannot have everyone picking the same character, they're not bound to specific roles on the team like in, say, a hero shooter. Every player gets to have their own personal journey in terms of loadout and classes. The latter mostly refers to the mutant abilities you have equipped from a device strapped to your chest that's keeping you from being corrupted by the Sludge God's infection. Usually, this means being able to drop area-of-effect fields that your buddies can stay in to improve their defense or offense, the kind of boost you'd want when facing down hordes of undead. There's also no restriction if everyone in your party decides to play a support class, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, when it's a co-op FPS that involves blasting zombies, thoughts of Left 4 Dead aren't far behind. However, the shooter I ended up thinking about as we took on our demo mission was actually Halo, Saber having also had a hand in that game's anniversary edition remaster. Not only was the map we roamed a pretty large sandbox, with plenty of optional areas to explore and also mark with pins, we could also get around in vehicles. These are randomized in each session, so you might come across a pick-up truck or an ambulance van, or find an armored vehicle where someone can get onto the gun turret while the camera pulls back in third person for the driver. It has the same joy as piling onto a Warthog with your buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some considerations to keep in mind with the vehicles you drive, though--they need gas to run, so you might need to find fuel to top up the tank. A turret also has limited ammo, so you won't be able to use it indefinitely. Some vehicles might not have the tires to handle going up some steep and muddy slopes, and it's impressive how Toxic Commando essentially makes use of the tech seen in Saber's off-road driving sims like Mudrunner and Snowrunner to give vehicles different capabilities in a variety of situations. Again, the armored vehicles are the most capable for getting around, and come with a very handy winch that can be used for pulling down barriers in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The real technical star of the show, however, is Saber's proprietary Swarm Engine. Originally created for World War Z's huge zombie hordes, and impressively utilized for the swarm of Tyranids in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Willits said the engine has evolved to even greater heights in Toxic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">"The environments are much larger than they were in World War Z, so the swarms come in all sorts of different directions," he explained. "We have more super creatures, special monsters, but just like our upgrade progression system in World War Z and Space Marine 2, you have different classes and you can upgrade your abilities, loadouts, even some of your passives."</p><p dir="ltr">That also ensures there's never a dull moment. When following the objective of destroying specific tendril nodes so that we could reach a church, we encountered a swarm of undead. But even when exploring other points of interest, the engine keeps the map populated with enemies so that there's always something to shoot or contend with while trying to find loot and stock up on supplies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At times, the non-stop hordes can get overwhelming. Case in point: Toward the end of the mission, we reached the church and had to endure a siege of undead coming from all directions. Willits said Toxic Commando is probably the most difficult game the studio has made in years, given how much the action can ramp up. But that difficulty is managed in real-time by the Swarm Engine's AI director that's designed to also make you feel like the odds are against you.</p><p dir="ltr">"It keeps track of who you're fighting and balances the difficulty," he explained. "When you're playing and feel like, 'My god, I'm not going to survive,' and then you just pull through at the last second, a lot of that is the AI director."</p><p dir="ltr">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Turok knows a thing or two about rebirth. The original character debuted in a 1950s comic book but came to wider attention after Valiant Comics revived him as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in the early '90s. It was this comic that became the basis for the game series that began on the N64, which was arguably the most influential console-based shooter of the time after GoldenEye. Following 17 years of dormancy after the mixed reception of its 2008 self-titled reboot (while it wasn't actually a commercial flop, a sequel was nonetheless canned), Saber Interactive has stepped up to the plate to make the cycle begin anew with Turok: Origins.</p><p dir="ltr">I was admittedly skeptical when it was first announced at last year's Game Awards, as it seemed to be a third-person co-op shooter. The good news from my first hands-on at Gamescom 2025 is that the game can be played in both first- and third-person, and while this preview session was about getting a feel for the co-op PvE gameplay for up to three players, members of Saber Interactive's Madrid-based team assured us that it will also be possible to play the game solo without AI allies, so as to stay true to the original single-player experience of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUPvMp_s5nc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUPvMp_s5nc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But most importantly, Turok: Origins gets back to the fundamental core of what you want from a Turok game: killing dinosaurs with big guns.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, some twists to that formula. As the subtitle suggests, this is a revival that goes back in the timeline, to well before the original game. Turok isn't the name of a character but rather a tribe of hunters, while still very much taking its inspiration from tribes indigenous to North America. As you would expect from a team-based game, you have a choice of different classes to play as, each inspired by different spirit animals--Raven, Cougar, and Bison--which dictate the loadout and abilities you have, though you're free to change classes before each mission starts.</p><p dir="ltr">The dinos are actually referred to as Xenia, a hostile reptilian force that's predominantly made up of familiar four-legged lizards, though this also gives license to introduce some more humanoid enemies, as well as what could be best described as a troll with scales. But wisely, the first mission in this demo gave me what I wanted from the outset, which was to drop us into a prehistoric-looking jungle while being jumped by waves of raptors. They were a blast to dispatch, whether I was playing with a first- or third-person perspective, which is something that you can seamlessly switch between. The third-person option also lets you toggle which shoulder the camera is behind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The reason behind the controls feeling so good may be down to the developer confirming that the pipelines for first-person and third-person are actually separate, so they do feel distinct. You can also see some differences such as how, when hitting crouch while sprinting, you'll perform a slide in first-person but roll forward when in third-person. Melee is also an option, and even when playing in first-person, the camera will always pull back to third-person. I can see how this is more ideal for performing a variety of brutal cinematic finishers; when you've weakened a dino to the point they're glowing yellow, your prompt to move in as your hunter rips them apart from their long jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">As cool as some of these execution animations were, I couldn't do them as often as I wanted, mostly because another teammate was still raining ammo on them and finished them off before I could press the prompt in time. In a subsequent mission inside an ancient temple, the team was able to split up to tackle threats coming from different directions, which gave me more opportunity to dispatch Xenia as I saw fit. At the same time, I was also trying out each of the available, first with the automatic-toting Cougar, and then the tankier Bison and their close-range shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class also has three unique cooldown-based abilities as well as an ultimate, typical of modern class-based shooters. After a couple of missions, I found my groove with Raven's long range bow, and I was pulling off many satisfying headshots. One downside, though, was if I didn't kill them instantly, then I'd be too far away to run in for the killing blow. Despite this, it was with this Raven class that I used their abilities with the most confidence, including one where they charged up a sort of rallying cry that instantly killed weak enemies, summoned a swarm of glowing wasps to attack a nearby target, or created a temporary barrier against projectiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I nonetheless did return to Cougar for the demo's final encounter, an arena boss fight against a huge Triceratops that almost had a whiff of Monster Hunter about it. With my medium-ranged auto-plasma shots, it was a good way of landing hits from a distance while being able to dodge when it charged at me with its horns. The Cougar's ultimate is also especially useful by temporarily granting you a very powerful bow that you can let loose an infinite supply of arrows.</p><p dir="ltr">There was quite a lot to take in, as the developer ushered us through a varied and curated experience within 30 minutes. To ensure a tight pace, the dev made everyone gather in a glowing blue circle when it was time to advance to the next part of a mission--which also meant some optional paths were deliberately walled off for the demo. Even in this more linear structure, however, I still had the opportunity to use my grapple to swing up over certain walls or jump up to higher ground to take down out-of-reach enemies. That kind of platforming traversal is another hallmark from the original Turok games that carries over here.</p><p dir="ltr">While I would still prefer to be able to get the chance to experience Turok: Origins in a single-player scenario, this first hands-on has nonetheless put aside any initial doubts I might have had. In Saber Interactive Spain's hands, a franchise many had assumed would remain a fossil looks like it's getting a revival that could actually stick around this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Turok: Origins is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The first game, Corpse Party, tells the story of a friendship ritual gone horrifically awry after it transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality. Exploring the Heavenly Host Elementary institution, the group has to risk their sanity and safety to uncover the truth behind bone-chilling murders that occurred at the location, if they ever want to return home again. The version included in the collection is the 2021 version of the game that was released for PC, which itself is actually the third remake of Corpse Party originally released for the PS Vita in 2010.</p><p>The next game, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, is an ambitious anthology series released in 2011 that served as a sequel, prequel, midquel, <em>and</em> an alternate universe tale, all in one package. It builds on the events of the first game, offering players new perspectives on several of the original game's most critical events.</p><p>2012's Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash is billed as a midquel set that takes place during the events of Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. It tells the story of the ghost of Sachiko Shinozaki’s murderous birthday party at Heavenly Host Elementary.</p><p>Finally, Corpse Party: Blood Drive was released in 2014 and is set two months after Book of Shadows. Designed to be the ultimate conclusion to the Heavenly Host story arc, the story revolves around black magic, the end of the world, and a mission to resurrect fallen friends.</p><p>While Corpse Party: Blood Drive was the final game in the Heavenly Host story arc, it's not the end of the franchise. A spiritual sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corpse-party-2-darkness-distortion-preorder-guide/1100-6522304/" data-ref-id="1100-6522304">Corpse Party 2: Darkness Distortion</a>, is set to launch in Jun 2026--giving you enough time to catch up on the previous four games with the new collection. Darkness Distortion will once again be a visual novel, this time following three high school friends as they explore the Amare Est Vivere Hospital to see if a local urban legend is true.

                <p dir="ltr">It might be easier to score tickets to a Sabrina Carpenter concert than it is to obtain Switch 2 development kits. Almost 12 weeks after the console's launch, developers--big and small--are reportedly still struggling to get them.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=504s">Digital Foundry</a> discussed the Switch 2 dev kit situation on its weekly podcast (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>). "Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility," said John Linneman, a senior staff writer for Digital Foundry. "There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things." GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing story surrounding Switch 2 from before launch and even as recently as last month. In April, a report surfaced stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/">small developers were struggling to get their hands on dev kits for the hybrid system</a>. But it's not just indie teams, as a July report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">some AAA studios having a hard time acquiring them</a>, too. This could be why there haven't been a slew of major third-party releases, or announcements, for the system lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Oliver Mackenzie, a contributor at Digital Foundry, touched on AAA studios possibly still not getting Switch 2 dev kits. "But like there's that campfire game, you know the kind of camera campfire game, and they're getting kits, and some big developers on the other hand, who developed like AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits," said Mackenzie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chillin-by-the-fire-out-today-on-switch-2-allows-you-to-chill-by-a-fire/1100-6533581/">Chillin by the Fire is the game</a> that Mackenzie is referencing, and it launched right after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/#1">the Nintendo Direct in July</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 has broken home console sales records</a> since launching June 5. In fact, at the start of this month, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 has already sold 6 million units</a>. Looking ahead, there are rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">a possible Nintendo Direct set for mid-September</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly 25 years from its initial release on the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee continues to be one of the most popular games in the platform fighting franchise, particularly in the modding community. One modder, Mooshies, decided to add one of gaming's newest icons to the battle: Jimbo from Balatro.</p><p dir="ltr">The jolly jester's Smash Bros. Melee variant is a reskin of Mr. Game and Watch, with all of the movements and attacks of Mr. G+W intact. However, Mooshies's mod replaces all of the original character's weapons and sound effects with cards, images, and sounds from the 2024 smash hit roguelike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QjT-WGHvoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9QjT-WGHvoM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mooshies released a brief gameplay trailer showing Jimbo in action, along with the wild and wacky way he uses the recognizable jokers and card packs from Balatro in matches against Falco, Marth, and more. This was originally released as a paid mod, but Melee players interested in trying Jimbo out can find the mod on <a href="http://patreon.com/Mooshies" rel="nofollow ">Mooshies's Patreon page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Smash Bros. community has been bereft of new content across the entire series since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's final update in 2021, which saw Sora from Kingdom Hearts join the roster as the final downloadable fighter in SSBU's Fighter Pack 2. Other downloadable fighters added to Smash Bros.

                <p>Ysbryd Games has officially announced the delay of Demonschool's release, shifting its launch date from September 3 to November 19. The decision, described as one made with "anguished consideration," comes in response to an unexpectedly competitive release window, headlined by the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">Hollow Knight: Silksong's September 4 debut</a>--and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">not the first game delayed because of the surprise release</a>.</p><p>This surprise timing left the indie publisher little choice but to reconsider. "Crueler still," noted the press release, written by founder Brian Kwek, "that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p><p>The publisher emphasized the difficult nature of launching a title in 2025 due to the early fall season being increasingly crowded, with other major titles such as the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and Ghost of Yotei launching within weeks of each other. For those unfamiliar, Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG with some clear Persona influence sprinkled in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully," the statement continued, adding "there are no more delays after this point." The delay also enables the inclusion of additional content at launch, including alternate endings and minigames that were originally slated for post-release updates.</p><p>Demonschool will be available for all current major platforms, including PC via Steam. Ysbryd and developer Necrosoft Games expressed its gratitude to fans for their continued patience and enthusiasm. "We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games' labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th," concluded Kwek.</p><p>"This was not our choice, but we understand why the choice was made. We aren't mad at Ysbryd but at the situation. Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out," Necrosoft Games said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky post</a>. "Ysbryd is being a good partner and paying for the delay. We're sorry this is happening." Ironically, a release date had been anticipated for quite some time, and the original September launch date was committed to only a few weeks ago.</p>
