                <p>Flappy Bird, one of the most viral games ever that became massively popular before being delisted by its creator, has returned. There are some key things to know, however, that could give you pause about jumping back in.</p><p>This new version of Flappy Bird comes from The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and was not produced in partnership with series designer Dong Nguyen. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/flappy-bird-studio-addresses-criticism-but-ignores-the-games-biggest-controversy/1100-6526576/" data-ref-id="1100-6526576">announcement in 2024</a> was mired in controversy surrounding cryptocurrency concerns. In the announcement of the new game's launch, the developer said there are "no Web3 elements," despite the company's background in that area.</p><p>Flappy Bird can now be downloaded on Android devices from the Epic Games Store. There is no word yet on if it's also coming to iOS, or if the planned PC edition is still coming, but the developer said more news is on the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbTah7oqj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ftbTah7oqj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new Flappy Bird has two modes: Classic and Quest. In Classic, players do what they did 10 years ago, which is tap the screen to make the bird jump to avoid pipes for as long as possible. Quest mode, meanwhile, features levels with set goals, with new content added "regularly."</p><p>Flappy Bird makes money through in-app purchases that remove ads. Players can also buy special helmets that allow players to revive themselves.</p><p>Nguyen originally removed the game in 2014 because he thought it became "an addictive product," which ran counter to his belief that it should be played in short bursts.</p><p>"I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said at the time.</a></p><p>Nguyen is not involved with the new Flappy Bird and apparently made no money of its return. That's because, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/how-crypto-bros-wrested-flappy-bird-from-its-creator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica reports</a>, a company called Gametech Holdings filed a "notice of opposition" against Nguyen in late 2013. After Nguyen did not respond to the notice, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office canceled his trademark, which gave Gametech the opportunity to acquire it.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has outlined the Year One roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will kick off in May with several big new features being added to the game. In a dev diary, Ubisoft confirmed that early May will see new story content added to the game--focusing on Portuguese scholar Luis Frois--alongside a new ally, abilities, and quality-of-life updates.</p><p>Late May will see a major upgrade made to the parkour gameplay, as Naoe will be able to wall-vault and grab a low ledge, plus she'll have a few other new moves at her disposal. This includes height-gaining back-eject and fully reanimated height-gaining side-eject moves.</p><p>Another nice upgrade coming at the end of May will be an enhanced photo mode, as you'll be able to make Yasuke or Naoe strike a pose before you take a photo. Ubisoft is also teasing special collaborations in late May, but it remains to be seen who you'll meet in your trek across Japan. Moving ahead to June, you can expect more story content, a fresh face joining your league, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/">and a new difficulty mode</a> that Ubisoft had previously teased.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLB-WNvQEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game will also be updated with more immersion options--like turning off the outline that appears on a character when they enter stealth--optional headgear in cutscenes, and the alarm system from castles will be applied to the entire game world. Beyond that, Ubisoft is working on lots more additional content, like New Game Plus mode, more codex updates, new Animus content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion. This will still be free to anyone who preordered the game, and it adds a new island to explore and a bo staff weapon category for Naoe to master.</p><p>Ubisoft has been steadily working on Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">with major title updates adding PS5 Pro upgrades</a>, an auto-follow option for players when they're on horseback, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-assassins-creed-shadows-update-fixes-more-bugs-and-ps5-pro-graphical-issues/1100-6530897/">and bug fixes</a>.

More expensive Founder's Packs, which come with additional currencies and cosmetics, are also available.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpdoaR8N_a4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fpdoaR8N_a4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The open-world RPG set in the universe of HBO's popular Game of Thrones show, and featuring the likeness of show actors like Kit Harrington, will support full cross-play and cross-progression between mobile and PC. In it, players take on the role as the heir of a minor Northern house, and after choosing a class (Sellsword, Knight, or Assassin), embark on a quest to restore their house's honor while battling foes in real-time combat that requires dodging and parrying enemy attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">In early access, players can currently explore the Northern regions of Westeros like the Wall and Castle Black, play a portion of the game's main story, complete side quests, and participate in co-op dungeons against fantastical beasts never before seen in the Game of Thrones show but hinted at or mentioned in the universe's lore.</p><p dir="ltr">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> are currently sitting at "Mixed" overall, with players criticizing its monetization mechanics even as they praise the game's overall presentation and story.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the popularity of Game of Thrones, aside from a slew of mobile strategy games, there have been relatively few other interactive takes on George R.R. Martin's fantasy universe. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will only be the second third-person action RPG set in Westeros, with the first being Cyanide Studios' 2012 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/game-of-thrones/" data-ref-id="5000-113588">Game of Thrones</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, more Game of Thrones games could be on the way in the future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">Warner Bros.

But the party is getting started a little early in Los Angeles. AEG Presents and Activision have announced that THPS Fest is coming to LA's famous El Rey Theatre on May 8. Tony Hawk himself will be on hand for the event alongside his fellow pro skaters as they reveal new details about Pro Skater 3 + 4. And fans will be able to watch it live on Twitch.</p><p>The news came with a brief announcement trailer that features the exterior of the real El Rey before transitioning to some of the levels from Pro Skater 3 + 4.

However, the official release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 won't be until July 11. It's coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It has also been announced that Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be on Game Pass on day one.</p>
