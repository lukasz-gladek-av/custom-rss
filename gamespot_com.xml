                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116" data-mce-href="/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/" data-ref-id="1100-6532688" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/">its debut on Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Now, CD Projekt Red is bringing the game to Mac almost five years after it was released on PC and consoles.</p><p>Starting on July 17, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com. According to Apple, this port will take advantage of "the advanced technologies of Metal" for a "smooth performance," as well as "sharp visuals, amazing battery life, and seamless gameplay."</p><p>The game will also have support for spatial audio and head-tracked spatial audio on Mac, which can be utilized with AirPods. Cyberpunk 2077 can be run on Apple silicon Mac configurations with 16GB or more of unified memory. But for the best performance, it's strongly suggested for systems on macOS 15.5 or later.</p><p>Although Cyberpunk 2077 is no longer in active development, there is still at least one more big update to the game underway. However, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/">recently delayed update 2.3 for an indefinite period</a>. The stated reason was that the programing team needs more time, and the update will apparently in "a scope similar to Update 2.2."</p><p>Meanwhile, the sequel has taken on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/" data-ref-id="1100-6531871" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/">working title of Cyberpunk 2</a>. That game may be several years away, but Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has already hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/" data-ref-id="1100-6531705" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/">the sequel will include a second city</a> alongside Night City from the first game.</p>

                <p>So far, there have only been a handful of third-party games confirmed for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but an industry insider has claimed that many studios don't yet have development kits, and this is to blame for the limited announcements.</p><p>That's according to YouTuber Nate the Hate (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-games-delay-lack-of-dev-kits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), who discussed the console's noticeable lack of titles from third-party studios and indie partners in his most recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y"> podcast</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> episode</a>.</p><p>"This has been a talking point amongst Nintendo fans really since the Switch 2 has come out, and it's definitely spurred up once again in the most recent days," Nate the Hate said. "And that is the question of, 'Where are the games? Where are the game announcements from third parties and indie partners? And when are they going to be happening?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NYkD9QCBp4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Nate goes on to say that the problem goes back to GDC 2025, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tfm_xUEQPc&amp;t=3277s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> had put out comments saying that a lot of development partners lack access to dev kits.</p><p>"This is something that remains true," he explained. "And it's not just indie developers. It's also those double-A and low triple-A developers who currently lack access to dev kits. And for a lot of them, they're kind of sitting there scratching their head wondering, 'When is Nintendo going to give us access?'"</p><p>Nate the Hate's co-host, Modern Vintage Gamer, also claimed that there are "quite a few" studios and publishers who don't have Switch 2 development hardware right now, and suggested that there are roughly two-thirds that made games for the original Switch that don't have access to dev kits.</p><p>"I think one-third of developers, publishers, that have worked on Switch 1 titles have access to Switch 2 hardware, but the remaining are still waiting for their hardware to come in," said Modern Vintage Gamer.</p><p>While there's no official word on what third-party games have yet to be announced, Nate later claimed that there are several companies, including Capcom and Sega, still waiting for dev kits, and that although Microsoft is planning to support the console, the dev kit issue will push these plans back to 2026.</p><p>"I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco, and many others are just waiting," he said. "They have games they want to announce for the platform.
