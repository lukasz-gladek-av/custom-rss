                <p>Baby mobs have been around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> for a while, but these creatures are getting an adorable makeover for a future update. Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested. When the update is finished, the dev team promises that the wolf pups, kittens, piglets, calves, baby chickens, baby ocelots, lambs, and baby rabbits will be "even chunkier, floofier, and more charming than ever before."</p><p>In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures. This update is giving the baby animals their own specific designs and completely new sound recordings pulled from real animals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLDBHodmGs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FaLDBHodmGs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Larsen went on to explain a more subtle touch that gives the baby mobs' faces a more youthful appearance.</p><p>"Typically mobs in Minecraft have two-pixel eyes," said Larsen. "But now baby mobs have just one which creates a new vibe for them, which is just adorable."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/first-features-minecraft-cutest-drop-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devs also revealed</a> that players will be able to name their baby mobs with craftable labels using paper and any metal nugget. Players can preview the changes in Java snapshot and the Bedrock beta preview now.</p><p>In December, Mojang Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-lets-players-ride-into-combat/1100-6536825/" data-ref-id="1100-6536825">the Mounts of Mayhem update</a>, which lets players ride animals into combat situations among other changes. Minecraft was also one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-downloaded-app-store-games-of-2025-include-fortnite-minecraft-and-balatro/1100-6536838/" data-ref-id="1100-6536838">the most popular games on the App Store in 2025</a>, according to Apple.</p>

                <p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report on the site TipRanks</a> said that Microsoft is "considering massive layoffs" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whatlayoff.com/post/3mbtiwjmgtz2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2008806488190709970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2008865530749571146" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purported that the news was "false"</a> on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxshaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to his LinkedIn</a>--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.</p>  — Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>There's a lot of skepticism under both Corden and Shaw's posts. However, Shaw has responded to a lot of the commentary, saying that he, too, "<a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/2008942834754441434" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eagerly awaits</a>" the news that he claims is wrong.</p><p>None of this is to say that layoffs at Microsoft may not happen in some future. The company has gone through a myriad of job cuts recently. This just underscores that you can't believe everything you read online, as some--if not most--of it is engagement bait.</p><p>That said, Microsoft has cut jobs at the company recently. In early July 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">laid off roughly 9,000 employees</a>, with Xbox head Phil Spencer calling the cuts "necessary" for the company's enduring success. As a result of these cuts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">several games were canceled and studios were closed</a> so that the company could "increase agility and effectiveness," Spencer said at the time. Despite those layoffs, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft still reached a valuation of $4 trillion</a> in late July 2025.</p>

                <p>MachineGames is working on a third new Wolfenstein game to follow 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order and 2017's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. This is according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, both of which said the game is happening but had no other details to share.</p><p>This would be the first new Wolfenstein game since Wolfenstein: Youngblood and the VR game Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, both of which were released in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-dev-hopes-to-return-to-the-franchise/1100-6534556/" data-ref-id="1100-6534556">In September 2025</a>, MachineGames creative director Axel Torvenius said he wanted to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," Torvenius said in a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>If MachineGames is indeed working on a third Wolfenstein game in its trilogy, it could be announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">this month's Xbox Developer Direct </a>or the expected Xbox summer showcase, though these are both just guesses.</p><p>Beyond a possible new Wolfenstein game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Prime Video is producing a live-action Wolfenstein TV series</a>. It's still early days, though, and there is no word on any specifics about the show.</p><p>The Wolfenstein titles take place in an alternate timeline where Germany won World War II after they discovered advanced technology. The Wolfenstein video game series has been around since 1981, and 1992's Wolfenstein 3D from developer Id Software is credited as one of the key games that helped popularize first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>
