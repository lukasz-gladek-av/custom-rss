                <p>After two years of contract negotiations with parent company Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United members have voted in overwhelming favor to authorize a strike. The union announced the news earlier today via a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> shared by Communications Workers of America, writing, "We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games. All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union.”</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the news comes after more than two years of contract negotiations between ZeniMax Workers United and Microsoft. Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">union's formation back in 2023</a>, members have been actively pushing Microsoft for better wages, workplace improvements, and to address "key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company’s replacement of in-house quality-assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union." Last November, members of the union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-video-game-workers-walk-job-maryland-and-texas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">walked off the job</a> in a one-day strike, to "call out the company for lack of progress at the bargaining table." Though the most recent vote does not mean union workers have officially gone on strike, it gives the organization permission to call for one, should contract negotiations further break down.</p><p>"Despite being one of the world's largest corporations, we've had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much," ZeniMax Workers United member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield wrote in the press release. "Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</p><p>Consisting of more than 300 quality-assurance workers across Bethesda and ZeniMax studios, ZeniMax Workers United is one of Microsoft's largest unions. Its members are known for their work across several prominent Microsoft series, including The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Doom. With Doom: The Dark Ages scheduled to release in just over a month, a strike could have significant consequences for Microsoft.</p><p>Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA members who work in the video games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">continue to strike</a> following growing concerns about AI. As of right now, it's still not clear when the strike (which went into effect July 26, 2024) might end. As it stands, any developer looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform must sign either the new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement before moving forward with production, all of which offer "critical AI protection."</p><p><em>Update: Following this article's publication, a representative from Microsoft reached out to GameSpot to provide the following statement:</em></p><p><em>"Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love. We respect the team's right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair--if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">A new event is coming to Destiny 2 as part of the final arc of Episode Heresy: Rite of the Nine. This limited-time event will bring with it tons of new challenges, the return of some fan-favorite loot, and even a new social space. Here are all the details you need to know about Rite of the Nine and how it will work.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</a></li><li><a href="#What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</a><ul><li><a href="#Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</h2><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine doesn't have an exact release date as of yet, but it will be launching <strong>sometime after the start of Episode Heresy Act III</strong>, which is now live, having launched on April 1, 2025. This will be a limited-time event that likely will last until the launch of the new expansion of Destiny 2, currently only known as "Project Apollo" from Bungie's 2025-2026 roadmap. But the specific end date is unconfirmed.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these three featured dungeons previously requiring a Dungeon Key from their respective expansions, <strong>Rite of the Nine will be free for all players</strong>. That means anyone with a base copy of Destiny 2 can play the event while it is live.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will be focused solely on dungeons in a similar vein to the Pantheon challenges from Into the Light. Three dungeons will be featured on rotation: <strong>Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher,</strong> and <strong>Ghosts of the Deep</strong>. The Rite of the Nine event adds a slew of new difficulty modes, updated loot, and a revamped farming system to earn loot on repeated runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have access to a new social space called <strong>The Third Spire</strong>, which is a revised version of the old victory space from Trials of the Nine when players completed a Flawless run. Here, players can visit an old ally, the <strong>Emissary of the Nine</strong>, for access to all the new rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, one dungeon will be listed as the featured dungeon and players will engage in various challenges in that one dungeon. There will be three difficulty options available, allowing players of all skill levels to earn something. For players willing to take on the highest difficulty, special loot is up for grabs.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will feature 12 revised weapons from past encounters with an all-new selection of perks. Adept versions will be available earned if dungeons are completed on the highest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">A new Origin trait called <strong>Gravity Well</strong> will be exclusive to these weapons. Along with the initial Origin perk in the fifth column, Gravity Well will also be able to be chosen as an option. Gravity Well's effects are listed as "Reloading this weapon automatically gathers nearby ammo." It's not known exactly how far away this takes effect, but the perk seems to gather any nearby ammo bricks on the ground, Heavy or Special, and pull them to your character on a reload.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also visit the Emissary of the Nine in the Third Spire space to attune their loot drops from dungeon completions. Similar to how the Brave Arsenal worked in Into the Light, only one attunement can be active per run, and this will increase the likelihood of obtaining that weapon as a reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Players who finish a dungeon on the highest difficulty,<strong> Ultimatum</strong>, will be able to earn an Adept weapon. These weapons have a unique shader effect on them making them glow and shimmer. Adept versions of weapons will also have boosted stats over the normal versions, so they will have an upper hand over normal drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the 12 weapons coming with Rite of the Nine:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prosecutor</strong> Auto Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Relentless</strong> Pulse Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Judgment</strong> Hand Cannon</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>A Sudden Death</strong> Shotgun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wilderflight</strong> Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Long Arm</strong> Scout Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Liminal Vigil</strong> Sidearm</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Terminus Horizon</strong> Machine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>New Pacific Epitaph</strong> Breach-loaded Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Survivors</strong> Submachine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greasy Luck</strong> Glaive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cold Comfort</strong> Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Other rewards from Rite of the Nine also include <strong>five new Emblems</strong>, <strong>a new Title/Seal</strong>, and <strong>weapon ornaments.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine's rotating dungeons are broken up into three difficulty tiers, allowing players of any skill level to earn something and experience a challenge. Each mode changes aspects of the dungeon, such as displaying helpful tips to the rather difficult "Notswap" modifier. Here's how each one is broken down.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This mode is essentially "Beginner Mode" with an incredibly forgiving difficulty level and much less harsh punishments for wipes and party deaths. While we don't know the maximum Power level for these dungeons yet, we can assume it will be a low bar to clear. The rules for Explorer Mode are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Darkness Zones.</strong> Normally when players come across a Darkness Zone, if the full time dies with no revives available, the encounter resets back to the start of the last checkpoint. In Explorer Mode, Darkness Zones are completely disabled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Revive timer is only five seconds.</strong> Revive Timers in dungeons typically range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds. In Explorer Mode, they are much more forgiving so players can be revived more quickly.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Tooltips explain mechanics.</strong> Before beginning the encounter, tooltips will be visible that explain how each encounter basically functions. New players will be able to immediately pick up on these tips and execute their mechanics.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Waypoints guide players</strong> during more open sections of dungeons. These will constantly be visible to guide players to the next objective.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Helper platforms</strong> appear when a player reaches a checkpoint, helping those who struggle with jumping puzzles.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">Bungie has not shared the full details on how this mode will work, but it is likely more geared towards casual players seeking a challenge. It's possible most of the standard rules for dungeons will be present here such as Darkness Zones, longer revive timers, and possibly even more strict timers on certain encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be a scoring mechanic live in Eternity Mode that will gauge players' performance based on time spent on an encounter, enemies killed, and revives remaining after an encounter is completed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the highest difficulty level for Rite of the Nine. Basically this is only where the best of the best can thrive. It's likely this will have a lower power cap and feature lots of extra modifiers to make the encounters much more unforgiving and difficult to navigate. The rules that we know of so far are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contest Mode difficulty.</strong> Much like when a raid is live for the first time, players will be at least 20 levels below the Power level of all enemies in the dungeons. Enemies will also be much more aggressive, shooting more often and running towards players whenever possible. Limited revives will prevent players from completing encounters if they run out.</li><li dir="ltr">"<strong>Notswap" Modifier.</strong> Notswap is a new modifier where, if a player swaps an Exotic armor, a weapon, or a class, all of their energy is drained to zero. All cooldowns will be reactivated, the Super gauge will be set to zero, and they will have to regain all energy to use abilities again.</li></ul><p>Scoring will be based on deaths.The fewer deaths accumulated through an entire run, the higher the score will be. If players achieve a <strong>Platinum</strong> score, they will receive an <strong>Adept</strong> weapon at the end.</p>
