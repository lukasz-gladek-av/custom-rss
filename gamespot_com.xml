                <p dir="ltr">Want to watch a cute kitty paw at a taskbar and earn hats? Then Bongo Cat should be right up your alley. In fact, the free-to-play game has clearly struck a chord with a wide swath of people, as over 125,000 people are playing it right now (at time of publication), per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" rel="nofollow ">Bongo Cat</a> is a clicker game that sees a feline patting a taskbar with its paws as a player types or clicks a mouse. That increases your points and treasure chests will eventually appear, too, containing different types of hats. There are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3419430/view/519709240792712815?l=english" rel="nofollow ">20 exclusive items tied to an event this month</a> that runs through April 22. That same announcement on March 31 noted that Bongo Cat has seen over 500,000 different players. It was also one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/steam-next-fest-winter-2025s-most-popular-demos-include-game-of-thrones-and-dune/2900-6299/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6299">the most popular demos from Steam Next Fest in February</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3419430/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The SteamDB chart</a> shows that Bongo Cat was averaging about 40,000 concurrent players for the second half of March before exploding at the beginning of this month. The clicker game hit a peak of 134,411 players yesterday but has been pretty close to topping that number today. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-massive-and-inexplicably-popular-banana-game-adds-new-skins/1100-6524446/">not quite as popular as Banana</a> from last year, but Bongo Cat seems to scratch a similar itch. The game is seeing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">"overwhelmingly positive" reviews</a> so far on Steam.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/repo-has-come-out-of-nowhere-on-steam-topping-145000-concurrent-players/1100-6530038/">REPO came out of nowhere on Steam</a> with more than 145,000 concurrent players. The cooperative horror game continues to see a steady stream of players and has even made some waves <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/r-e-p-o">on Twitch</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Even after a reveal showcase over the weekend, there was confusion about one crucial aspect regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a>: the game's price point. Developer Bungie has clarified that the extraction shooter won't be "a full-priced title." However, the entry cost still hasn't been detailed, with that info apparently arriving in the summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> noted that the game would be full priced since Bungie has referred to the shooter as "a premium title." <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1911121437848371405" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Wario64 shared those details before <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow ">the official Marathon account</a> stepped in to spell out the current pricing situation for Marathon. Yes, it's described as a premium experience, but it won't carry a premium price tag (think $70). What the entry cost will ultimately be for the game will have to wait for a few months, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Last September, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/">reported that Marathon would cost $40</a>. There were no plans to transition to a free-to-play model at the time, and apparently the shooter was too far along in development to even make that change. Previously, Sony (which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/">now owns Bungie</a>) has released similar live-service games at the $40 price point: Helldivers 2 and Concord. Obviously, the results from those couldn't be more different, but there is clear precedent for that entry fee.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch September 23</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If that date sticks out to you, it's probably because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> will arrive on that same day. Before then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon is getting a closed alpha this month</a>. You can join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow ">the game's Discord channel</a> for a chance to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon isn't the only game at the center of a price-point debate this month. Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">defending the decision to launch Mario Kart World for $80</a> on Switch 2 in June. People also seem a bit taken aback that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-switch-2-welcome-tour-a-paid-game-that-explains-the-new-console-features/1100-6530546/">Switch 2 Welcome Tour isn't a pack-in experience</a> with the upcoming system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

challenging if you had the right loadout. Protagonist Sam Porter Bridges amassed an impressive arsenal of weapons to use against the BT entities--which weaponized his blood and other bodily fluids to harm them--and near the end of the game, you would gain access to a rocket launcher that could be used to take down kaiju-sized BTs.</p><p>The recent trailers for Death Stranding 2 have suggested that we'll see the scale of these boss fights increase. One of the new BTs glimpsed is essentially a giant gnarled hand that can outrun Sam, and in another scene, Sam's ally Heartman faces off against a truly colossal BT by combining another BT with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-preorder-a-model-kit-based-on-death-stranding-2s-magellan-vehicle/1100-6530029/">DHV Magellan submersible</a>, creating something that looks <em>very </em>similar to the Metal Gear Rex mecha. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/">Considering that Death Stranding 2 has its own Solid Snake</a>--sort of--it's not exactly surprising to see references to Metal Gear Solid in a Hideo Kojima-directed game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 24</a> for PS5, and it looks like the live-action movie adaptation of this post-apocalyptic series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-death-stranding-2-fanciest-in-game-timepiece-is-real-but-itll-cost-you-1600/1100-6530011/">may have just found its director</a>.</p>

However, Sony has also decreased the price of the PS5 disc drive attachment. The price changes are now in effect. In a statement, Sony said it was a "tough decision" to raise prices, and it's not the first time--Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-price-increasing-in-europe-canada-and-more/1100-6506882/" data-ref-id="1100-6506882" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-price-increasing-in-europe-canada-and-more/1100-6506882/">first raised prices in 2022.</a></p><p>"With a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, SIE has made the tough decision to raise the recommended retail price of the PlayStation 5 console in select markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Australia and New Zealand," Sony said in a statement.</p><p>The changes are as follows:</p><p><strong>Europe</strong></p><ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition - €50 increase from €450 to €500</li><li>PS5 Standard with disc drive - No price change</li><li>PS5 disc drive - €40 decrease from €120 to €80</li></ul><p><strong>UK</strong></p><ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition - £40 increase from £390 to £430</li><li>PS5 Standard with disc drive - No price change</li><li><p>PS5 disc drive - £30 decrease from £100 to £70</p></li></ul><p><strong>Australia</strong></p><ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition - AUD $70 increase from AUD $680 to AUD $750</li><li>PS5 Standard with disc drive - AUD $30 increase from AUD $800 to AUD $830</li><li>Ps5 disc drive - AUD $35 decrease from AUD $160 AUD $125</li></ul><p><strong>New Zealand</strong></p><ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition - NZD $60 increase from NZD $770 to NZD $860</li><li>PS5 Standard with disc drive - NZD $50 increase from NZD $900 to NZD $950</li><li>PS5 disc drive - NZD $30 decrease from NZD $170 NZD $140</li></ul><p>Analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1911562139317207542?s=46" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1911562139317207542?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">commented on the price increase</a>, saying that the price of the PS5 won't just increase due to recent tariffs, but also that there is a compounding impact between inflation, exchange rates, and macroeconomic trends that affect pricing. Back in August 2024, Sony raised the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-will-become-about-90-more-expensive-in-this-major-market/1100-6526135/" data-ref-id="1100-6526135" data-mce-href="/articles/ps5-will-become-about-90-more-expensive-in-this-major-market/1100-6526135/">price of the PS5 in Japan by 13,000 yen</a>, which is nearly $90.</p><p>Many are also wondering what the the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">impact of tariffs and general economic conditions might have on the Switch 2</a>, but it remains to be seen since Nintendo hasn't opened US preorders yet.</p>
