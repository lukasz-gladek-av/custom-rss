                <p>New images for a "Cross-Buy" system have been spotted on the PlayStation Store, sparking speculation that Sony might be looking to introduce cross-platform purchasing of some kind in the future. The graphics for this were spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985841552288104906" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amethxst</a> on X and corroborated by reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p><p>According to Dealabs, the Cross-Buy tags were added by Sony all the way back in June 2025, but what the company's definition of this term could be is unknown. For comparison, Microsoft offers a cross-buy feature where Xbox games can be played on PC, (sometimes) through cloud streaming, or anything else that it considers to be an Xbox--like the ROG Ally X handheld.</p><p>Could Sony offer a similar deal, considering that it has made more of its first-party games available on PC after a period of exclusivity on PS5? That's unknown, but it is worth pointing out that Sony previously used Cross-Buy as a term for games sold during the PS Vita handheld era. If PS3 or PS4 owners purchased certain games back then, they'd get the PS Vita for free and vice versa, allowing them access to one game over multiple platforms. The service was eventually phased out, but at the time, it was a major draw for PS Vita owners.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">With a PS5 Portable handheld also rumored to be in development</a>, having some form of cross-buy that links both home and handheld consoles could be a way to drum up interest in that potential hardware.</p><p>While it remains to be seen what form Cross-Buy takes--if Sony pushes ahead with it--fans of the PS Portal handheld can look forward to a major update for that streaming device. After a year in beta, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps-portal-update-adds-full-cloud-streaming-two-years-after-launch/1100-6535944/">Cloud Streaming for the PS Portal</a> has officially "arrived" and is open to all PS Plus Premium subscribers. The game library for Cloud Streaming has expanded to almost 3,000 games, and several new features have been added to help users play games in different streaming modes.</p>

Since then, the two tech titans have decked it out in various courtrooms. But now, the two sides have apparently reached a settlement, pending the approval of the court.</p><p>Google's president of Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, shared the announcement online and touted "a proposed set of changes to Android and Google Play that focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Exciting news!

Sweeney called it "a comprehensive solution," before reminding everyone that Epic's ongoing battle with Apple is far from over. He said Google's actions stand "in contrast to Apple's model of blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Google has made an awesome proposal, subject to court approval, to open up Android in the US Epic v Google case and settle our disputes.

It also required Google to stop forcing devs to use Google Play Billing for user payments. </p><p>As an alternative, the settlement would feature a deal that runs through June 2032 and would be valid worldwide, not just in the US. Google's new terms would drop its standard fee for apps to 20% or 9%, depending on the type of transaction. It also pledges to let outside app stores register with Google and reach customers more easily.</p><p>Google spokesperson Dan Jackson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that the proposed fee changes are separate from Google Play Billing. But users will have the option to pay with other billing systems. </p><p>"If the user chooses to pay through an alternative billing system, the developer pays no billing fee to Google," said Jackson.</p><p>Epic Games and Google will meet with the presiding judge later this week to discuss the settlement. If the court signs off on it, their legal war will be over.</p>
