                <p><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google</a> will be making a major policy change on who will be allowed to stream on YouTube, which will affect a lot of young people. As of July 22, new guidelines state that the minimum age required to livestream will be raised to 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, YouTube allows teens aged 13 and above to stream solo, as is also the case with Twitch. However, the new rules (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-changes-live-streaming-policy/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>) will mean that creators will need to be 16 years or older to livestream on the platform. Children between the ages of 13-15 will still be allowed to appear on a livestream but the policy states that they must be "visibly accompanied by an adult" or else their live chat will be disabled and their account "may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features."</p><p dir="ltr">These new measures may impact young creators trying to build an online following without the intrusion of parental supervision, but it's also a sign that YouTube is prioritising online safety for children. The policy is also only regarding livestreaming, so there does not currently appear to be any new age restriction when it comes to posting pre-recorded videos.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">Roblox also placed new restrictions on its youngest users</a> by restricting kids under 13 from accessing unrated experiences or social hangouts, following repeated accusations that the platform was failing to protect children from would-be predators.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963"> Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s toughest boss fight, the Darkdrift Knight, is now in-game for a limited time only as his <strong>Everdark Sovereign</strong> version. Fulghor is one of the toughest Nightlords to beat thanks to his hard-hitting attacks combined with relentless speed. If you're trying to get all of the Remembrances, then you'll already have attempted to beat Fulghor on more than one occasion. To unlock and fight his Everdark Sovereign version, you'll need to have bested him at least once. Beyond that, here's the best way to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, including his weaknesses and our recommended builds.</p><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_recommended_setup">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight recommended setup</h2><p>The Darkdrift Knight, and in turn his Everdark Sovereign version, is weak to Lightning damage, but has resistance against Holy damage, as this is the type of damage he deals. You'll want to equip lightning-based relics such as the Dark Knight of Baron, which is acquired by beating the Sovereign Gaping Jaw, last week's Sovereign boss. If you didn't get that relic, choose any that boost Lightning attack power, strength, or dexterity stats.</p><p>On your way to the Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, make sure to interact with the Scale-Bearing Merchant if you come across him. He gives the option to grant resistance to status ailments, enhanced armaments, an additional sacred flask, runes, or improved physique. We chose to take the enhanced armament to increase the chances of getting anything Lightning-based. The best weapon to take to face him is the <strong>Bolt of Granssax</strong>. If you don't come across it, try to find any Lightning weapon. The <strong>Sword of Milos</strong> is also valuable, since it decreases the physical damage output of all bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091"></a><figcaption>Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight">How to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight</h2><p>After fighting this boss for several hours, it's safe to say he's not easy to take down. He's certainly harder than Gaping Jaw, but it does depend on your playstyle. As standard, he starts at phase two of his regular boss fight, and will already have his darkened arm that he uses for long-range attacks. He also uses it to slam down and create an area-of-effect (AoE) attack. Dodging this enables you to get some close-range hits in, as he will pause for around three seconds before continuing his assault.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092"></a><figcaption>Do not stand in the Darkdrift Knight's golden glow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>When Fulghor is charging an attack, you can stagger him by using heavy attacks. This is crucial to giving you and your teammates a window of opportunity to get some damage in. He will occasionally stampede through the arena using his lance. The golden light that he emits while doing this stampede will explode, so ensure you're not inside it when that happens.</p><p>Breaking the boss is easier with a Colossal weapon, so it's definitely recommended to hit him with heavy attacks as often as possible to enable you and your teammates to get damage in during those phases. This is most efficiently done as either the Raider or Wylder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">Nightreign classes</a>. Ironeye can use marking, which builds more Poise damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095"></a><figcaption>When Fulghor points to the sky, run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>During his next phase, Fulghor will spawn clouds that rain down arrows, which track you down. This is accompanied by a twinblade attack during which he will leap into the air and spin down to the ground with a slam. He also attacks with a regular bow with tracking arrows. The only way to avoid this is to run away--and fast. He will spin attack three times before concluding with the AoE slam.</p><p>If you see a wind effect on his blade, prepare for a wind attack. He will become faster and use a nuke attack. If he starts running and leaps high into the air, he's preparing to launch an explosive arrow with a massive AoE attack, which tracks. You'll either have to perfect dodge, perfect parry, or sprint away to give yourself more time to dodge it from a distance.</p><p>The most important strategy to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight is to remember to use your heavy attack. When he starts to aim, this is your crucial window to land heavy hits and break him. Then, your entire party can begin to hit him with as much damage as possible.</p><p>Repeat this process as many times as possible, remembering to prepare to perfect dodge three times when he begins his charge attacks. Though it is tricky timing, it is possible to perfect dodge those consecutive attacks. Eventually, he will be felled, and you can reap the rewards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099"></a><figcaption>You can purchase Fulghor's Enhanced Relic from the Collector Signboard after the fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_drops_and_rewards">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight drops and rewards</h2><p>Upon defeat, the Sovereign Fulghor will drop <strong>25 Sovereign Sigils for the first defeat, and 10 for each subsequent defeat</strong>.

<p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>, Microsoft's vice president of enterprise and OS security David Weston said, “This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster. Part of it is just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.”</p><p dir="ltr">The new design is expected to roll out "later this summer" in a Windows 11 update. This will also include a new Quick Machine Recovery feature, designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot. These new changes can be seen as Microsoft bolstering Windows following last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/finally-deleting-part-of-system32-can-actually-fix-your-computer/1100-6525156/">CrowdStrike incident</a> when the BSOD affected millions of Windows machines, leading to one of the biggest server outages in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows is also taking a more headlining role in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">next generation of Xbox consoles</a>, as Sarah Bond said the vision is to create a platform where games are "always with you" across devices, while games are not "locked to a single store." This can also be seen with the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/">Xbox ROG Ally Windows handhelds</a> it's releasing in partnership with Asus.</p><p dir="ltr"><i>Image Credit: Getty Images/MirageC</i></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is a new entry in the long-running series, which started with an arcade co-op title in the 1980s. This time, the franchise is going in a fresh direction that shares roguelike roots with Dead Cells and The Rogue Prince of Persia. Bub, the green dragon, is the star of the show in the single-player, side-scrolling platformer, searching for treasures and doughnut exits to each area.</p><p dir="ltr">The dungeons will change with each playthrough for Bub, but the green dragon will have the iconic bubbles to bounce on for navigation as well as trapping foes. In addition, Bub can utilize special bubbles--like fire and water--to take out enemies. Treasures found in Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons then can be utilized to upgrade Bub's bubble skills and traded for items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuoLXelpv8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AsuoLXelpv8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Like other roguelikes, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons wants players to "grow stronger and go deeper into the dungeon," per the game's showcase trailer (seen above). It's a notable departure from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remember-bubble-bobble-its-back-in-nintendo-switch/1100-6469085/">the last game in the franchise, Bubble Bobble 4 Friends</a>. That title stayed true to the arcade roots of the series but offered up four-player co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is set to launch in Winter 2025 for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>Double Dragon has been one of the marquee names for almost 40 years in the beat-'em-up genre. 2023's Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons was the last installment, acting as a prequel to the entire Double Dragon story. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/double-dragon-revive/">Double Dragon Revive</a> is more or less a fresh take on the first game, with Billy's girlfriend Marian being kidnapped. Revive is set for release in late October, but if you preorder now, you'll be able to get a second game: Double Dragon Dodgeball.</p><p>In this pixelated retro-style minigame, Team Sou-Setsu-Ken (consisting of Billy, Jimmy, and their friends) fight their way through a dodgeball tournament to once again rescue Marian. You can check out a quick snippet of the game in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyhbM6DtET8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JyhbM6DtET8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This isn't the first time the Lee boys have crossed over into the world of sports. Diehard Double Dragon fans might remember Super Spike V'ball for the NES, which includes Billy and Jimmy as playable characters. There was also the WWF Superstars arcade that included Billy as a member of the crowd, though he unfortunately couldn't take on Hogan for the championship.</p><p>You can preorder Double Dragon Revive for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/game/double-dragon-revive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>. The game is scheduled to launch on October 23.</p>

On Twitter, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford chimed in on how the 95% discount on Borderlands 3--dropping the price from $60 to $3--has happened over five years after the game was first released. However, don't expect to see Borderlands 4 retail for the price of a cup of coffee--or land on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass--for a long time after launch, as Pitchford wanted to temper expectations.</p><p>"Sales like this and Borderlands 3 showing up on console subscription programs took over five years from the game's launch to happen. Take advantage when it's here! And to set expectations, it will be even longer before this kind of thing happens in the next cycle with Borderlands 4," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>.</p>

<p>At a time when the average price of a AAA video game has jumped from $70 to $80--following decades of it being set at $60--the news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">Borderlands 4 would be priced at $70</a> was welcomed by many fans. Of course, that's for the standard edition of the game, as the more deluxe versions of the looter-shooter will retail at a higher price. Discounts also come and go, and typically, the price on a new release drops around 10-15% several months after launch.</p><p>Of course, with enough incentive, plans can change. Borderlands 3 was given away as an Epic Games Store freebie back in May 2022, just a few years after it first launched, and it was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-july-2024/1100-6524517/" data-ref-id="1100-6524517">given away through PS Plus in July 2024</a>.</p><p>Pitchford's comment also comes at an interesting time for subscription services, as there have been discussions by developers and publishers regarding programs like Xbox Game Pass. Former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-approach-to-video-game-subscriptions-is-healthier-than-xbox-former-exec-says/1100-6531904/">recently expressed concern about these services</a>, but he also added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases years after launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/">was "immediately profitable"</a> and the studio spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. On the other hand, other developers have spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also had to address statements about how the service can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/">potentially cannibalize game sales</a>.</p>
