<p dir="ltr">Individual Reliquaries vary in price but cost less than the game's old 90-tier battle pass, though they can all be bought together for the same $10 price as previous battle passes. Rewards can also be chosen in any order by spending tokens, rather than having to grind through potentially dozens of levels for a player to reach a particular reward that interests them. As in previous seasons, there are still free seasonal rewards for those who don't want to pay but still participate in the season, this time in the form of this season's Belial's Return Reliquary.</p><p dir="ltr">While being able to specifically purchase particular types of cosmetics and unlock specific rewards first is nice, the number of rewards on offer in total is far less than Diablo 4's old battle passes, something that has not gone unnoticed by players.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's the removal of 500 Platinum (the game's premium currency used to purchase the battle pass and in-game shop cosmetics) from the battle pass that is causing the most outrage. In previous seasons, Diablo 4's premium battle pass awarded 700 Platinum. That was still 300 short of being able to purchase next season's battle pass, as in many other live-service games, and a controversy in and of itself. Diablo 4 Season 8's battle pass now only offers 200 Platinum in total.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the most popular posts on the Diablo 4 subreddit currently is one comparing the old battle pass to the new one from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kav4ce/reliquaries_are_a_massive_downgrade_born_from/?rdt=47498" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITheDarkitect</a>, who breaks down the differences between free and premium rewards offered under previous seasons and in Season 8. They note how the new premium Reliquary doesn't offer any emotes, headstones, titles, or emblems like previous battle passes, as well as the loss of additional Platinum for those who buy the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">"The massive downgrade, especially the 500 Platinum cut, and the supposed 'freedom of choice' that pretends to make it better, don't surprise me at all," ITheDarkitect writes. "I'll spend my money somewhere else."</p><p dir="ltr">What changes Blizzard may make in the future is unclear, but it doesn't seem Blizzard is likely to make dramatic changes to Reliquaries in Season 8. The new system will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Diablo 4's upcoming crossover with Berserk starting on May 6</a> and last until the end of the season.</p>

The highly anticipated follow-up to the hit 3DS game, Living the Dream is a quirky life sim in which players create Miis and watch the humorous interactions they have as they live out their daily lives as part of an island community.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo will undoubtedly have a lot more to share about the game as we get closer to its release, but in the meantime, here's everything we know about Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Tomodachi_Life__Living_The_Dream_be_released_">When will Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has yet to pin down a firm release date for Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, but the company has confirmed the game will launch sometime in 2026.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_platforms_is_Tomodachi_Life__Living_The_Dream_on_">What platforms is Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream on?</h2><p dir="ltr">At the moment, Nintendo has only confirmed that Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will be released for the original Switch. The company has not yet said anything about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering that several other upcoming Switch 1 titles (such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>) will be cross-gen, it's possible this could also apply to Tomodachi Life. However, nothing has been confirmed as of yet. At the very least, the game should be playable on Switch 2 through backwards compatibility.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Tomodachi_Life__Living_The_Dream">Preorder Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream</h2><p dir="ltr">With its release date still a ways off, retailers have not yet begun taking preorders for Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Price">Price</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not yet announced how much Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will cost. While most first-party Switch 1 titles typically retail for $60, it remains to be seen if that will be the case for Tomodachi Life as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Trailer">Trailer</h2><div tabindex="0"

href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a> presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">The video begins with a slow pan over a peaceful shoreline, where we see one beachgoing Mii casually toot while asleep on a beach chair. The trailer then showcases a handful of different Miis going about their daily lives on the island, from an elderly man breakdancing in front of a crowd to a pair of characters angrily throwing items at each other during a heated argument.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Tomodachi_Life_gameplay_details">Tomodachi Life gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream marks the third installment in Nintendo's quirky life-sim series, and while many details about the game are still up in the air, it appears the series' hallmark gameplay and humor are intact.</p><p dir="ltr">In past installments, players would create (or import) Mii characters and have them live together on an island community, watching as the Miis went about their day-to-day lives. They could work part-time jobs, take strolls along the beach, and visit each other’s apartments, which often resulted in humorous interactions.</p><p dir="ltr">In contrast to Tomodachi Life for 3DS, where each Mii occupied a different apartment in one shared building, it appears the Miis in Living the Dream will live in their own small houses. A clothing store and supermarket can also be spotted in the background of the announcement trailer, hinting that players will still be able to purchase outfits and meals for the Miis. However, it remains to be seen if the Miis can still get married and have children.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to Obsidian's comedic sci-fi RPG, is set to release later this year. Obsidian's second major release of 2025 following Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2 has been pitched as a bigger and better version of the original, expanding the scope of the game while adding in more ways to approach situations. Obsidian RPGs are well known for giving you a variety of ways to solve a problem, and The Outer Worlds 2 seems to be continuing that tradition.</p><p dir="ltr">While The Outer Worlds 2 still hasn't been fully revealed by Microsoft, with just a release window for later this year, it has been confirmed that the second half of Xbox's June showcase will be a deep dive on The Outer Worlds 2, likely giving a release date and more information about the RPG.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 currently has a release window of 2025. Microsoft is likely announcing a more exact date at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox June showcase</a>, where The Outer Worlds 2 will be the main focus of a Direct following the showcase. While we don't know when the release will fall, we do at least know it won't be prior to that June showcase.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rvTE-3S4c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer was released in 2019, featuring only a CG cutscene. At The Game Awards in 2024, a second trailer was released, showing off the gameplay of The Outer Worlds 2, along with the 2025 release window. The trailer itself shows a decent amount of gameplay, from normal shooting to invisible sneaking and high-octane explosions, but it doesn't focus on the narrative of The Outer Worlds too much. Instead, it focuses on the fact that Obsidian has made a number of highly regarded sequels in the past, like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 and Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 is releasing on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. As an Xbox Game Studios title, it will be available on Game Pass for both console and PC at launch, alongside the option to purchase it at full price. At the time of writing, The Outer Worlds 2 has not been confirmed to be releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, although Xbox has expressed interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-doesnt-make-microsoft-nervous-about-its-own-next-gen-plans-phil-spencer-says/1100-6530893/">supporting the Switch 2</a> and the first game did come to the Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">While most story details have yet to be revealed, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> for The Outer Worlds 2 does have the basic premise. You play as the Earth Directorate agent, tasked with uncovering the source of devastating rifts in Arcadia. The Arcadia colonies are currently in a war as the Protectorate's rule is challenged by rebels. Oddly enough, the outsider with government authority trying to solve a massive problem is very similar to the pitch for Avowed, although the way the narrative shakes out over the course of the game will likely be different.</p><p dir="ltr">While more details haven't been shared just yet, the Steam page also confirms the return of companions and emphasizes player choice when it comes to how you tackle quests, both in the main story and side quests.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992"></a><figcaption>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature a variety of sci-fi weaponry.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg"></figure><p>The Outer Worlds 2 appears to have feature gameplay similar to the original, but refined. As shown in a gameplay video (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhDvnM3wBaQ">IGN</a>), it's a first-person RPG, where--depending on how you like to play--you will be shooting, sneaking, and stabbing your way through enemies in combat encounters. If you have played the original, Avowed, or Fallout 4, you have a pretty good idea of how combat can flow. You will also be looting--both enemies and chests--gathering materials, valuables, and new gear.</p><p dir="ltr">That's just combat of course, as you will also spend a decent amount of time talking to NPCs. How these conversations go depends on your build, letting you play anyone from a charismatic smooth-talker to an intimidating brute. You can also use food and drugs to give stat boosts, letting you appear to be charming, even if you aren't. There will also be plenty of main missions, side quests, and companion missions, if it's similar to the first game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</h2><p>Development news has been fairly light for The Outer Worlds 2 since its reveal in 2019. After that, there was a trailer at The Game Awards 2024, and a few gameplay videos have been released in the time since. However, The Outer Worlds 2 is getting a deep dive at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8, with a Direct focus entirely on the game after the main showcase. Xbox has done a couple of these single-game presentations after the main show in recent years, typically spending 20-30 minutes deep-diving into the game and interviewing developers. That is likely the next time news about the game will be revealed, including a release date.</p>

                <p>Flappy Bird, one of the most viral games ever that became massively popular before being delisted by its creator, has returned. There are some key things to know, however, that could give you pause about jumping back in.</p><p>This new version of Flappy Bird comes from The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and was not produced in partnership with series designer Dong Nguyen. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/flappy-bird-studio-addresses-criticism-but-ignores-the-games-biggest-controversy/1100-6526576/" data-ref-id="1100-6526576">announcement in 2024</a> was mired in controversy surrounding cryptocurrency concerns. In the announcement of the new game's launch, the developer said there are "no Web3 elements," despite the company's background in that area.</p><p>Flappy Bird can now be downloaded on Android devices from the Epic Games Store. There is no word yet on if it's also coming to iOS, or if the planned PC edition is still coming, but the developer said more news is on the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbTah7oqj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ftbTah7oqj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new Flappy Bird has two modes: Classic and Quest. In Classic, players do what they did 10 years ago, which is tap the screen to make the bird jump to avoid pipes for as long as possible. Quest mode, meanwhile, features levels with set goals, with new content added "regularly."</p><p>Flappy Bird makes money through in-app purchases that remove ads. Players can also buy special helmets that allow players to revive themselves.</p><p>Nguyen originally removed the game in 2014 because he thought it became "an addictive product," which ran counter to his belief that it should be played in short bursts.</p><p>"I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said at the time.</a></p><p>Nguyen is not involved with the new Flappy Bird and apparently made no money of its return. That's because, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/how-crypto-bros-wrested-flappy-bird-from-its-creator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica reports</a>, a company called Gametech Holdings filed a "notice of opposition" against Nguyen in late 2013. After Nguyen did not respond to the notice, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office canceled his trademark, which gave Gametech the opportunity to acquire it.</p>
