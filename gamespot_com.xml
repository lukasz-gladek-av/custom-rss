                <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-has-laid-off-19-employees-at-red-storm-entertainment/1100-6533043/" data-ref-id="1100-6533043">laid off devs at Red Storm Entertainment</a> amid a larger restructuring of the company, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">spin-off subsidy with Tencent</a> that will focus on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Now, Ubisoft is looking to shed even more developers, and it's been called out online by fans and industry figures for the way it characterized layoffs as a "voluntary career transition."</p><p>The affected studio is Massive Entertainment, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.  The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/" data-ref-id="1100-6533297">failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations</a>, but Ubisoft did not say if that's why staff are being let go. In the message shared below, Ubisoft states that it has "introduced a voluntary career transition program giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."</p><p>Some observers have called that "corporate speak," but it's also reminiscent of Newspeak from 1984. Either way, the responses have been swift.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SolomonGloom/status/1981103204310941805" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That's a pretty fancy way of saying you're doing layoffs.</p>  ‚Äî Solomon Gloom (@SolomonGloom) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonGloom/status/1981103204310941805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/AntoineCheriet/status/1981036397910724902" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is, without question, one of the most poorly written layoff press release I‚Äôve ever read in my life.</p>  ‚Äî Antoine Cheriet (@AntoineCheriet) <a href="https://twitter.com/AntoineCheriet/status/1981036397910724902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MiguelRaimundo_/status/1981028618449916008" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">"Hello Ai: Write a statement where we announce that we are laying off a bunch of people without saying we are laying off a bunch of people, thanks."</p>  ‚Äî Miguel Raimundo (@MiguelRaimundo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiguelRaimundo_/status/1981028618449916008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bugasm16/status/1981042903540781076" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">dang. i didnt know division 2: survivors was reffering to the staff.</p>  ‚Äî Bugasm (@bugasm16) <a href="https://twitter.com/bugasm16/status/1981042903540781076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The account for DayZ Badlands even trolled Ubisoft with an announcement of its own.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DayZ/status/1981047838457921920" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Official non AI Statement:<br>We are massively committed to driving a massive wave of transformation that aligns with our massive vision for the future of entertainment.

                <p dir="ltr">2025 has been a tumultuous year for the Xbox brand, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">massive layoffs</a>, multiple price hikes for both its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">console portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>, and continued controversy over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-devs-call-for-microsoft-to-stop-working-with-israel/1100-6533901/">Microsoft's work with Israel</a> casting a shadow over the company's gaming wing. A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow ">Jason Schreier at Bloomberg</a> has shed some light on what's going on behind the scenes at Xbox, and a lofty profit goal looks to be the catalyst for these decisions.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the report, for the past two years, top executives have set an "across-the-board [profit margin] goal of 30 percent." The report says that the new target was set by Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, whose team has "taken a larger role in the gaming business in recent years."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589647"></a><figcaption>Perfect Dark, which was cancelled in July 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589647-perfect-dark.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For context, as Schreier reports, estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence mark the average profit margin for the entire video game industry at between 17 percent to 22 percent since 2018, with Xbox specifically coming in between 10 and 20 percent.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloomberg's report also indicates that the requirement for Xbox first-party games to be available on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service has hurt software sales overall. However, Xbox has employed a "member-weighted value" credit system which, as the report states, "is calculated based on several factors, such as the number of hours that Game Pass players collectively spend on a particular title."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of Xbox's new strategy has been releasing first-party games on competing consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5 have all launched on PlayStation 5 in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">notable success</a> according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">sales figures</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Those familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that "moving forward, games that are either cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls may take priority over riskier bets." Xbox has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#11">cancelled multiple projects</a> recently in pursuit of this 30 percent goal, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rares-canceled-xbox-title-everwild-finally-seen-in-leaked-screenshots/1100-6535397/">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">Zenimax's Project Blackbird</a>--all of which were in development for nearly a decade--among the biggest cancellations.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's next earnings report is currently scheduled for October 29. Before that, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-know-when-the-next-halo-project-will-be-revealed/1100-6535523/">next installment in Xbox's flagship Halo franchise</a> is set to be unveiled October 24 as part of the Halo World Championships.</p>
