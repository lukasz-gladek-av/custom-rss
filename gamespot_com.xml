                <p>So far, there have only been a handful of third-party games confirmed for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but an industry insider has claimed that many studios don't yet have development kits, and this is to blame for the limited announcements.</p><p>That's according to YouTuber Nate the Hate (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-games-delay-lack-of-dev-kits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), who discussed the console's noticeable lack of titles from third-party studios and indie partners in his most recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y"> podcast</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> episode</a>.</p><p>"This has been a talking point amongst Nintendo fans really since the Switch 2 has come out, and it's definitely spurred up once again in the most recent days," Nate the Hate said. "And that is the question of, 'Where are the games? Where are the game announcements from third parties and indie partners? And when are they going to be happening?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NYkD9QCBp4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Nate goes on to say that the problem goes back to GDC 2025, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tfm_xUEQPc&amp;t=3277s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> had put out comments saying that a lot of development partners lack access to dev kits.</p><p>"This is something that remains true," he explained. "And it's not just indie developers. It's also those double-A and low triple-A developers who currently lack access to dev kits. And for a lot of them, they're kind of sitting there scratching their head wondering, 'When is Nintendo going to give us access?'"</p><p>Nate the Hate's co-host, Modern Vintage Gamer, also claimed that there are "quite a few" studios and publishers who don't have Switch 2 development hardware right now, and suggested that there are roughly two-thirds that made games for the original Switch that don't have access to dev kits.</p><p>"I think one-third of developers, publishers, that have worked on Switch 1 titles have access to Switch 2 hardware, but the remaining are still waiting for their hardware to come in," said Modern Vintage Gamer.</p><p>While there's no official word on what third-party games have yet to be announced, Nate later claimed that there are several companies, including Capcom and Sega, still waiting for dev kits, and that although Microsoft is planning to support the console, the dev kit issue will push these plans back to 2026.</p><p>"I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco, and many others are just waiting," he said. "They have games they want to announce for the platform. They have a lot of support coming to this platform."</p><p>Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/split-fiction-review-it-takes-pew-pew/1900-6418341/" data-ref-id="1900-6418341">Split Fiction</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/" data-ref-id="1900-6418032">Hogwarts Legacy</a> are now available on the Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> Tarnished Edition set to arrive later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>: Ultimate Edition also got a Switch 2 version and is expected to receive<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/"> update 2.3 </a>very soon.</p>
