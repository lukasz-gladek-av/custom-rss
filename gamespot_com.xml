Monster Hunter Wilds will get a new monster called Omega Planetes, a four-legged machine boss from Final Fantasy XIV, along with FF14 cosmetics, like Chocobo mounts. This content will arrive as part of Title Update 3 in late September.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0SSf7KG8yw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O0SSf7KG8yw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Final Fantasy XIV will get content based on Monster Hunter Wilds, featuring the Seikret mount and a boss fight against Arkveld, the flagship monster from Monster Hunter Wilds. It's not clear how in-depth the quest line in FF14 will be, but the FF14 part of the collaboration will arrive in early October. The trailer does show a character investigating dead monsters and riding a Seikret through a desert canyon, so there will likely be a dungeon alongside the boss fight against Arkveld.</p><p>Capcom recently moved up the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">release of a new end game difficulty level</a> in an effort to expand the endgame content, which has received criticism from fans for lacking depth. Square Enix recently revealed that it is ending support for Final Fantasy XIV on Windows 10, although the game will likely still work on that operating system for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Lords of the Fallen 2--technically the third game in the series--takes place one hundred years after the 2023 reboot. The previous game revolved around traveling between the world of the living and the world of the dead. In the sequel, the two dimensions are converging. The debut trailer was shown as a part of <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the trailer, a voiceover intones the necessity of fighting the gods, who were potential allies in the first game. He urges the protagonist, the Lamp Bearer, to use a dark power to bring "retribution" to the heavens. It is unclear whether players will play as the same character from the last game, or which of the original's three endings Lords of the Fallen 2 will enshrine as canon.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was a pre-rendered cinematic, but it teased boss battles players may encounter in the full game. One such foe is an angel-looking woman with wings made up of multiple arms, like branches on a tree. At the trailer's climax, the Lamp Bearer fights the angel underneath a tower crowned with a gigantic flower.</p><p dir="ltr">The angel decimates him, and he awakens at the same tower, which is now surrounded by giants and encircled by massive vines. This implies that upon death, Lords of the Fallen 2's world will change, becoming darker and more dangerous. But details of how exactly this system will work have yet to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Lords of the Fallen received mixed reviews back in 2014. The reboot was a financial success, <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-is-getting-a-revamped-new-game-plus-option/1100-6518572/">selling over a million copies in its first 10 days of release</a>. Lords of the Fallen 2 was <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-announced-but-probably-wont-be-on-steam/1100-6524313/">announced back in 2024</a>. Epic has an exclusive licensing deal for its PC distribution.</p>
