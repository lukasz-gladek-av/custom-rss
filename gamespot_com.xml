Some theorized that Activision did this on purpose to help prevent people from quitting lobbies if they noticed they were going up against a group of high-level players. But it turns out this was only a bug.</p><p>Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1928497479617597649" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates account</a> confirmed that the developer is investigating a bug that is causing player levels and level icons to fail to appear in lobbies. "Thank you for your reports! We are actively investigating this issue," Activision said on the game's <a href="https://trello.com/c/uAEvrBoF" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trello board.</a></p><p>Some of the other known issues for Black Ops 6 multiplayer include theater mode being temporarily disabled due to an issue loading replays, lobbies showing the wrong platform icon next to a player's name, and the Winner's Circle failing to appear in some cases on Stakeout. Another known issue is that players who call in a Dreadnought may get stuck in a state where they're unable to crouch or slide.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a> There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-the-overlook-safe-room-in-call-of-duty-warzone/1100-6531953/" data-ref-id="1100-6531953">numerous new updates for Warzone, too.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-infamous-riot-shield-returns-in-black-ops-6-but-not-how-you-think/1100-6531923/" data-ref-id="1100-6531923">Call of Duty's infamous riot shield has debuted in Black Ops 6 as a finishing move. </a> There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick / Ballerina crossover store bundle coming soon.</a></p><p>If you're keen to try Black Ops 6's new Season 4 content, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-free-on-xbox-this-weekend-for-season-4-launch/2900-6626/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6626">multiplayer is free right now for Xbox users. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><span>First revealed at </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/">2022's The Game Awards</a><span>, BioShock writer-director Ken Levine's upcoming narrative-driven RPG, </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/">Judas</a><span>, is still shrouded in mystery. Developed by Levine's new studio, Ghost Story Games, Judas was almost immediately labeled as "BioShock in space" by fans. But as the game's launch draws closer, it's become clear that although Judas certainly draws inspiration from the series that made Levine a household name, it's not just BioShock with a futuristic coat of paint. Judas has its own identity.</span></p><p dir="ltr">While the details are still relatively sparse, trailers, preview events, and developer interviews have painted a much clearer picture of what players can expect from Levine's latest creation. If you're interested in decoding this enigmatic RPG, keep scrolling for a breakdown of everything we know about Judas, from plot details to gameplay features and everything in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Judas_launch_">When does Judas launch?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas was originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creators-new-game-will-release-by-march-2025/1100-6511235/">slated for a March 2025 launch</a>, but March came and went without a peep from Levine and the developers at Ghost Story Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there is no official release date for Judas. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/" rel="nofollow ">game's Steam page</a> lists its release date as "coming soon." In a recent earnings report, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9a22a038-45bc-48df-8391-07705b355877" rel="nofollow ">Take-Two listed the game's launch date</a> as "to be announced."</p><h2 id="What_platforms_is_Judas_releasing_on_">What platforms is Judas releasing on?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><h2 id="What_is_Judas_about_">What is Judas about?</h2><p dir="ltr">The game's description on Steam reads, "A disintegrating starship. A desperate escape plan. You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke--or will you leave it to burn?"</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be stepping into the shoes of the aforementioned troubled protagonist, Judas. Judas is a woman who appears to live and work on a spaceship called The Mayflower. The Mayflower has recently suffered some sort of disaster, one that--based on the game's description--Judas herself is at least partially responsible for. Many areas of the ship have broken off, depressurized, or caught on fire, and the goal is clear: Survive, no matter the cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185"></a><figcaption>It seems that most (if not all) of the Mayflower's inhabitants are robotically augmented.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on the protagonist's biblical name, it's likely that betrayal is a major theme in the game's narrative, though it's not entirely clear if Judas herself is the betrayer or the one who has been betrayed. Interestingly, the game's trailers feature several shots of injured androids who look identical to humans with the exception of a glowing green circle on the back of their hands.</p><p dir="ltr">"The ship is… dying," a visibly injured Judas declares in the game's announcement trailer. "And my only way out of here is with one of <em>them."</em></p><p dir="ltr">Judas herself may, in fact, be an android, as gameplay footage shows her sporting the glowing green circle on the back of one hand and shooting Plasmid-like powers out of it. It's also possible Judas is actually a human who has been robotically augmented, a la Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist, V. But if that's the case, Judas has been <em>very</em> heavily augmented--another trailer clip shows her finishing off an enemy while floating around outside the damaged Mayflower … without any sort of suit to protect her body from the vacuum of open space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186"></a><figcaption>A calendar reveals the year is 1979, while text on the left side of the screen suggests Judas herself may be an AI-controlled robot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Time travel may also be a theme in the game's narrative, as another trailer features a quick jump-cut in which Judas can be seen near a wall calendar indicating that the year is 1979. This could also be an illusion, however, as some of Judas's statements in the trailer suggest that the game takes place in a world where thoughts are recorded by a Big Brother-esque entity, and false memories can be implanted into the station's robotically augmented inhabitants, Westworld-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Other shots in the game's trailers reference "The Big Three," a trio of characters who once controlled The Mayflower. The Big Three is made up of Hope, a young woman with pink hair and a childlike aesthetic; Nefertiti, a woman with strange mechanical abilities and an affinity for fashion; and Tom, a middle-aged man in a cowboy hat. It appears that these three characters are Judas's enemies, and players may have to choose which one Judas escapes the ship with.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm here to set you free," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-judas-trailer-at-state-of-play-shows-off-bioshock-like-combat/1100-6520723/">Judas states in one trailer</a> as she presses a button, ignoring the computer terminal's warnings that doing so will cause a catastrophic failure. "Whether you like it or not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183"></a><figcaption>Prior to the disaster, The Big Three seemed to be quite popular with The Mayflower's inhabitants.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game's trailers indicate it's expected to receive an M rating. According to the ESRB, M-rated games are "generally suitable for ages 17 and up," but "may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language."</p><h2 id="Judas_gameplay_details">Judas gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">While "BioShock in space" is a great elevator pitch, what we've seen from the game so far suggests that Judas is far from a BioShock clone. Yes, it's a narrative-driven first-person shooter RPG from the guy who made BioShock, and thus bears some resemblance to the BioShock series. But Judas also differs from Levine's previous work in many ways.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable difference between Judas and the BioShock series is the fact that Judas is a procedurally generated roguelite.</p><p dir="ltr">"We call it pseudo-procedural because it's not like Minecraft where everything's being generated off a set of pure mathematical heuristics," Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/">explained in an interview</a>. "You build all these smaller piece elements in the game and then you teach the game how to make good levels essentially, and [a] good story, and most importantly, [make it] reactive to what you do."</p><p dir="ltr">The Big Three appear to Judas as holograms, and her relationship with each of them will play a major role in the game's narrative. Doing a favor for one member of The Big Three will increase their affinity for Judas, but is likely to displease at least one of the other two members, and anger comes with consequences. If Judas upsets one member, they may get back at her by ratting her out to another member by revealing her plans or current location. It's clear that Judas' story design--especially when it comes to player choices--goes much deeper than BioShock's <em>very</em> binary "Will you save the Little Sisters, or are you a complete sociopath?" narrative choice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184"></a><figcaption>Judas can open the strange implant on her left hand to swap out abilities. When the hatch closes, it glows green.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for the game's "roguelite" elements, Levine says that death is an integral part of the game. Items that allow Judas to regain health are scarce, and enemies are everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">"You do have the opportunity when you die to go change yourself," Levine says. "Improve yourself, change your tool chest--which is a pretty broad and variable tool chest--and change the Mayflower itself."</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on Judas's gameplay, check out GameSpot senior producer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/what-exactly-is-judas-spot-on/2300-6463749/">Lucy James' breakdown of the game</a>, which she played for five hours at a preview event in 2024.</p><h2 id="Judas_trailers">Judas trailers</h2><p dir="ltr">Check out all the trailers for Judas below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Judas reveal trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSrgezyVfF4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSrgezyVfF4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Judas story trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_r-un--bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though Judas is far from a BioShock clone, it still proudly bears the hallmarks of Levine's previous work: a dystopian setting, Plasmid-esque powers, and off-the-wall set pieces like a gigantic robotic dog that Judas boards like a Bathysphere.</p><p dir="ltr">What do you think of Judas's gameplay elements and narrative premise?

                <p>The Executor is one of the six default classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and it's unlocked automatically for all players after they complete the tutorial. If you've played previous From Software games, especially Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, then you'll immediately recognize the gameplay the Executor utilizes to defeat its foes.</p><p>However, this also means the Executor features a fairly high skill ceiling, requiring players to understand all of its abilities and strengths to use properly. Below, we'll go over the Executor class in its entirety and offer the best build for it in Elden Ring Nightreign.

The class focuses on swift and deadly attacks with the sword to deal massive amounts of damage up close to any enemy. The primary skill for the Executor is Dexterity, as you'll rely on your weapon speed and accuracy to inflict a majority of your damage.</p><p>However, the Executor isn't considered a tanky class, so you also need to dodge and parry enemy attacks to keep your character healthy. Fortunately, the Executor excels when parrying as long as you can predict the timing of your enemy's moves. If you can't get off a parry, then the Executor still has decent stamina to be able to dodge multiple times to get out of trouble.</p><p>You'll find that the Executor can deal some of the most damage out of any class in Nightreign, but you'll have to get extremely close to enemies to inflict that damage. As such, you'll often be at the center of attention when fighting a boss one-on-one, so you need to master attack timing and parrying to be effective with the Executor. Of course, you could also pair it with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-class-guide/1100-6531927/" data-ref-id="1100-6531927">Raider class</a>, which is the primary tank class in Nightreign that can take some of the attention off you as the Executor.</p><p>Overall, the Executor is a high-damage class that is able to take away chunks of health from enemies, but you need to make sure you also play defensively, as you'll be spending a ton of time up close and personal with enemies and bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148"></a><figcaption>The Executor's abilities in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png"></figure><p>Of course, you'll want to master the different abilities for the Executor as well, which you see below:</p><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Tenacity">Passive Ability: Tenacity</h3><ul><li>Receive boost after recovering from status ailments.</li></ul><p>This passive ability doesn't come into play too often, but when it does, you're extremely thankful it's there. Acquiring a boost when you run through some flowers to relieve you of a status ailment is great for a boss fight that follows, and you can use this to your advantage as well.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Suncatcher">Character Skill: Suncatcher</h3><ul><li>Draw a cursed sword that can deflect enemy attacks.</li></ul><p>This is one of the best character skills in Elden Ring Nightreign, as the Executor is able to wield a huge sword that is terrific for parrying attacks and minimizing any damage you take when fighting up close with an enemy.</p><h3 id="Ultimate_Art__Aspects_of_the_Crucible">Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible</h3><ul><li>Assume the form of the primordial beast.</li></ul><p>When the Aspects of the Crucible ultimate art is activated, you turn into a large wolf-like creature that can tower over most bosses in the game. The form doesn't last overly long, but you can inflict a large amount of damage and cover a ton of ground when the ability is active.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Executor_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Executor in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've briefly gone over the Executor's play style and abilities, it's time to tackle the Relics that you'll want to use for the class. As we mentioned before, the Executor's primary skill is Dexterity, meaning that you'll want to focus on Relics that improve that skill either directly or indirectly. However, you also want Relics that boost your defenses or sword attack power. If you're confused about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relics work in Nightreign</a>, we have a full guide that covers everything about them.</p><p>We'll go over a couple of the key Relics for the Executor below.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><p>The Old Pocketwatch is a Relic you receive for defeating the first expedition boss in Nightreign, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. It's the main way you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duchess-class-guide/1100-6531950/" data-ref-id="1100-6531950">unlock the Duchess class</a>, and while the Old Pocketwatch is intended for that class as a Relic, it's also quite useful for the Executor.</p><p>The Old Pocketwatch grants FP restoration for successive attacks and gives a +3 boost to Dexterity. As long as you're using a weapon like the katana during your runs, you'll make tremendous use of this Relic. If you have the default Executor Urn equipped, though, you won't be able to use the Old Pocketwatch as a Relic, as there's no green Relic Rite slot. However, you can purchase the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar for 1,200 Murk, which comes with red, blue, and green Relic Rite slots. The Old Pocketwatch can slide right into the green slot once you defeat the Tricephalos.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147"></a><figcaption>Purchasing the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png"></figure><h3 id="Golden_Sprout">Golden Sprout</h3><p>Next, you want to unlock and equip the Golden Sprout Relic. You unlock this Relic through the Executor's Remembrance quest in Nightreign, and it can slide into the red Relic Rite slot if you're using the Executor's Goblet.</p><p>The Golden Sprout Relic features three abilities, and they are:</p><ul><li>Slowly restore HP for self and nearby allies when HP is low</li><li>Roaring restores HP while Art is active</li><li><p>HP Recovery From Successful Guarding</p></li></ul><p>All three of these Relic boosts come in extremely clutch when using the Executor. Not only do you get a bonus for successfully playing defensively, but you also receive free HP restoration during your ultimate art and while your HP is low.
