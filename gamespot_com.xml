                <p>Microsoft has announced that it has collaborated with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to select internet-connected vehicles. By using LG's webOS Automotive platform, passengers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app. Players will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and an automotive data plan to access their gaming library, but Microsoft says that it will give them instant access to hundreds of games via Game Pass as well.</p><p>A new video showed off how this works, with the footage specifically focused on people in the rear enjoying some games--just in case you were worried that this partnership could lead to some IRL Forza Horizon from the driver in the front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlEDcuirA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GPlEDcuirA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not unsurprising to see Microsoft expand its cloud gaming initiative to cars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">as the company's marketing for its gaming brand in 2025</a> has been focused on how you don't need to own an Xbox console to play Xbox games. "This Is An Xbox" has been the primary slogan for this advertising campaign, which emphasizes how the Xbox ecosystem can be accessed through a wide variety of devices.</p><p>Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald also recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">Microsoft's plans for its next-gen Xbox console</a>, explaining that the company envisions players having options to play games while they're out and about and then pick up from where they left off by using dedicated hardware. "It's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center," Ronald said.</p><p>While an LG car equipped with internet functionality and dedicated monitors will <em>probably </em>be more costly than an Xbox console, it does make the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X mobile gaming PCs a more palatable option in comparison. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/">Set to launch on October 16</a>, pricing for them has not yet been revealed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wont-or-cant-reveal-rog-xbox-ally-x-price-yet-but-report-says-it-could-be-900/1100-6534122/">but it's rumored that the most expensive device</a> could cost up to $900.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> has a way of bringing players together, especially now that Xbox Series X|S gamers can join their PS5 and PC allies in the battle for Super Earth's survival. While Helldivers 2 players have requested an in-game social hub like the tower in Destiny, that won't be coming anytime soon. But it may be a feature in Helldivers 3.</p><p>Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani recently addressed the fan request for a Helldivers 2 social hub during an appearance on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/helldivers_3_will_get_social_hubs_feature/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-may-never-get-a-destiny-2-style-social-hub-but-the-good-news-is-helldivers-3-could-its-on-the-feature-list-for-the-next-one/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>). According to Jorjani, "it's on the feature list for the next one."</p><p>Just don't expect to move into that social hub anytime soon. As Jorjani previously noted <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1395509386113450106" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Discord</a>, "We honestly are focusing on the here and now. [Helldivers 3] is hopefully many years away."</p><p>Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, and that was before the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Into the Unjust update</a> dropped a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952">lot of new content</a> including some very difficult enemies on the Hive Worlds. The Hive Lords are particularly hard to kill unless you've got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-discover-the-secret-to-killing-hive-lords-nukes-lots-of-nukes/1100-6534440/" data-ref-id="1100-6534440">a lot of nukes handy</a>. You could try killing them without nukes, but those battles tend to be hilariously one-sided in favor of the Hive Lords. </p><p>Jorjani has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-lack-of-feedback-is-making-it-hard-for-devs-to-improve-the-game/1100-6534437/" data-ref-id="1100-6534437">the majority of Helldivers 2 players enjoy the game "silently"</a> and don't offer much feedback that the developers can use. Regardless, the team has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">releasing large patches</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-notes-resolve-more-hard-crashes-buff-new-dust-devil-items/1100-6534486/" data-ref-id="1100-6534486">smaller updates</a> to quash in-game bugs so you players can go back to killing the giant interstellar space bugs without further interruptions. It's a never-ending battle, so get to it, Helldivers!</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>The iPod age of gaming came and went fairly quickly during the two-decade lifecycle of Apple's signature brand of music players. Apple released 54 games for the iPod clickwheel that could have been lost to time if not for the efforts of game preservationists. It took a lot of effort to bring all of the games back together, but the complete lineup of iPod clickwheel games has now been preserved. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>, iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project founder Olsro recently completed the collection by tracking down a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/real-soccer-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-40149">Real Soccer 2009</a>. Preserving the titles meant finding people who still had the original games downloaded on their iPods and syncing them up to a Virtual Machine master library that lets other iPod owners access the games at their leisure. Olsro also expressed relief that the completed project "means this whole part from the early 2000s will remain with us forever."</p><p>The Virtual Machine titles are compatible with iPod Classic 5G, 5.5G, 6G, 6.5G, and 7G, iPod Nano 3G or 4G, and iPod Nano 5G. Olsro has shared detailed instructions for how to access the Virtual Machine on <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a>. Once those steps are followed, players should be able to enjoy those titles on their own iPods. </p><p>The complete list of preserved iPod clickwheel games is reproduced below.

The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-simulation-games/2900-6819/" data-ref-id="2900-6819">simulation game</a> will release in full later this year, but is currently previewing its kawaii aesthetic with a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622640/Vending_Machine_Co/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam demo</a>.</p><p>Japan is well-known for its vending machine culture, and this new management sim is putting you in charge of your own Japanese vending machine empire.

Managing your machines will initiate other little mini-games along the way, from repairs and upkeep to sorting and counting your cash.</p><p>Vending Machine Co. is due for a release at an unspecified date later this year, but has a free demo available now. The demo just got a handful of upgrades, including two new neighborhoods to explore and set up your vending machines in, as well as some standard bug fixes and balance updates.</p><p>When the full release drops later this year, it will include a bunch more neighborhoods, including a salaryman-centric business district, a temple area frequented by tourists, and a youth-focused university ward. The full game will also include more items, minigames, and collectables, and will encourage players to explore its curious neighborhoods outside of building their vending machine business.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
