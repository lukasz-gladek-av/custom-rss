                <p>Since its official launch in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/medieval-dynasty/" data-ref-id="5000-501316">Medieval Dynasty</a> has given players a glimpse of life in the middle ages without any fantasy flourishes. You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzajklWJTDI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dzajklWJTDI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term.</p><p>This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements.</p><p>From now through December 18 at 7:00 AM PST, Medieval Dynasty and The Exquisite Pack are on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4159030/Medieval_Dynasty__Exquisite_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The core game is available for half of its regular price, which comes out to $17.50, while the DLC is only slightly discounted to $3.99. The previous Medieval Dynasty expansion, Echoes of Nature, is also for sale at the $3.99 price.</p>

                <p>As The Game Awards draws closer, everyone's attention right now is on a mysterious demonic monolith that is teasing <em>something</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">First seen in the Mojave Desert</a>--and described by TGA host Geoff Keighley as being pure "regal.inspiring.thickness" as it stood there--the monolith has now been spotted in Los Angeles. It's not clear if this is the same monolith as the one in the desert or a new one, and there's still no clue what this piece of aura-farming architecture is teasing yet.</p><p>One franchise that it's probably not linked to? Battlefield, as Battlefield Studios senior director of integrated communications Andy McNamara snapped a photo of the monolith and <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1998267455622586639" rel="nofollow ">mentioned that it wasn't linked to EA's FPS franchise</a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there have been plenty more guesses as to what the demonic monolith will reveal. Some people have speculated that it could be teasing the next Diablo 4 expansion or The Elder Scrolls 6--industry reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-17#post-148370662" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims it's not related</a> to either IP--and CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2 being hinted at. God of War dev Cory Barlog has also downplayed rumors that the next God of War game is what the monolith is alluding to, and the only surefire way to find out what's behind the magic door will be to tune into The Game Awards this week on December 11 at 4:30 PM PT / 7:30 PM ET.</p><p>We've predicted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tga-2025-predictions-whats-going-to-happen-at-the-game-awards/2900-7307/">what we might see at The Game Awards this week</a>, and several studios have confirmed that new trailers for Exodus, Invincible VS, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero will be shown.</p>

                <p>The Analogue 3D is earning high praise as one of the best 4K N64 emulators ever made, and it'll soon be available in a wide range of "funtastic" colors. As part of a highly limited-edition release, Analogue will offer its console with transparent shells designed to emulate the look of classic N64 consoles from the 2000s. Priced at $300 each, these will launch alongside matching 8BitDo controllers on December 10 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET and will be delivered before Christmas.</p><p>Analogue says it spent over a year getting the colors just right for this release, and it collaborated with 8BitDo to replicate the look of the Funtastic originals. There'll be eight colorways to choose from: Jungle, Ice, Watermelon, Fire, Grape, Clea, Smoke, and a Gold model inspired by the legendary Toys R Us N4 console that collectors highly covet. The 8BitDo controllers will also be released in the same color set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619646"></a><figcaption>Analogue 3D console</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619656,1300-4619654,1300-4619653,1300-4619652,1300-4619651,1300-4619650,1300-4619649" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg"></figure><p>If you'd prefer a regular version of the Analogue 3D in black or white, it is being restocked on December 10 as well. The price of the base model <span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-3d-delayed-to-late-august-due-to-tariffs/1100-6533190/">increased slightly this year to $269</a>, and anyone purchasing one this month can expect it to start shipping </span>in January.</p><p>While the Analogue 3D has received positive reviews since the first wave shipped, it will face stiff competition from the ModRetro M64 console. Priced at $200, the M64 also uses an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) to replicate the N64's performance authentically, but it remains to be seen how accurate it is in comparison to the Analogue 3D.</p><p>ModRetro hasn't opened up preorders for the M64 yet, but you can explore it--and its trident-shaped controller--from multiple angles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/m64-console-revealed-heres-your-first-look-at-the-hardware-and-controller/2900-7290/">through this gallery</a>.</p>
