                <p>Emails are about to be way more interesting. A developer has created a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-6159022/" data-ref-id="1900-6159022">Doom</a> port that can be played within a PDF file on a web browser. Aptly named "doom.pdf," the file allows you to boot up the original game and control the character using your keyboard, following the usual WASD movement scheme, the space bar to shoot, and the numbers one to seven to circle between weapons.</p><p>The developer, who goes by ading.dev, shared some details about the process behind the hilarious project via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ading.dev/post/3lfluu6rw6k2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>. It's a bit on the technical side of things, but the port was possible thanks to PDFs supporting JavaScript. Using Emscripten, a compiler that compiles C and C++ source code to WebAssembly, they compiled Doom to asm.js, a subset of JavaScript. In short, it's how ading.dev got Doom running in a PDF.</p><p>Both input and output are done by manipulating text input fields. If you aren't tech-savvy, don't worry, as you don't need to manually input commands. In order to play the game, all you need is to <a href="https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open doom.pdf</a> and follow the instructions. You can either click on the control layout on screen, or type inside a box to mimick the keyboard controls. If the game doesn't work, make sure that you're opening the PDF in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome.)</p><p>While doom.pdf is far from the best way to play Id Software's classic shooter, it's a marvel to see the port in action. It's yet the latest example of developers and programming enthusiasts capitalizing on dozens of absurd iterations over the years, including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-doom-running-on-100-pounds-of-moldy-potatoes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">potato-sourced electricity powering a calculator</a>. If you're wondering what the current state of Doom is as a franchise, Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive in 2025. In June 2024, developers at Id Software said that Doom 1 and Doom 2 were inspirations for the protagonist's origins in the upcoming entry. If you're curious to learn more about it, Doom: The Dark Ages has a spot in the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">Xbox Developer Direct</a> later this month.</p>

                <p>In February 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3</a> director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-cyberpunk-2077-and-witcher-3-developers-form-rebel-wolves-studio/1100-6500740/" data-ref-id="1100-6500740">Konrad Tomaszkiewicz founded Rebel Wolves</a> alongside some other veteran developers. The first tease for the studio's inaugural game, The Blood of Dawnwalker, arrived last month. But now, Rebel Wolves has debuted the opening moments of the game, which establish how a valley in medieval Europe fell under control of vampires.</p><p>The trailer introduces the game's main character, Coen, as he attempts to save his plague-stricken sister, Lunka, from the human authorities who intend to execute her. Their lives are spared by the arrival of Brencis and his vampires, who quickly dispatch the guards. Brencis then heals Lunka and tells Coen that they are seizing control of the valley.</p><p>That scene takes place before the beginning of the game. When the main story begins, Coen and his fellow villagers have been living under the vampire regime for two years. Coen is also the titular Dawnwalker, because his silver poisoning prevented him from turning into a full vampire. Instead, Coen remains human during the day, and he transforms into a powerful vampire at night.</p><p>Although the developers stressed the narrative freedom that The Blood of Dawnwalker will give players, there is a ticking clock. Coen only has 30 days and 30 nights to save his family from Brencis' dungeons, and time is a commodity that he has to choose how to spend. Players can also decide to make allies with those who share his desire to bring down the vampires, but not everyone's agenda will line up with Coen's.</p><p>The developers also noted that the vampires do have human supporters, because Brencis has kept them safe and healed them from the plague. But the vampires also treat the humans like cattle, and they aren't free to leave the valley. They've just traded their human feudal lords for vampires who took their place.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker doesn't currently have a release date, but the gameplay reveal will arrive this summer.</p>

                <p>Hyper Light Breaker drops into early access on PC on January 14 (tomorrow!) and now it's got a trailer to match. The game is a 3D, open-world, co-op, rogue-lite sequel to Hyper Light Drifter.</p><p>Up to three players can explore the randomly generated worlds of Hyper Light Breaker. In that world they'll find bosses called Crowns, and, of course, plenty of weapons and loot to augment each player's build. This new entry is a departure from the series' past. Hyper Light Drifter was a single-player, pixelated, isometric action game. However, both share a neon-drenched color scheme, an emphasis on fast-paced action, and a story communicated mostly through gesture and aesthetic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClJaGZI-P78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ClJaGZI-P78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer shows most of this off. It follows a party of three "Breakers," who all have their own unique builds, as they explore the world. One wields a blue laser swords with a rifle. Another has a giant hammer. Special abilities also play a role, as one character drops a giant cube onto an enemy. The trio share movement abilities, including wall runs, hang-gliders, and hoverboards. The trailer also features footage from multiple boss battles, including one with a giant sword-wielding wolf and another against a glowing, armored warrior in a coliseum. Hyper Light Breaker was originally set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-delayed-to-fall-first-gameplay-trailer-revealed/1100-6512324/" data-ref-id="1100-6512324">early access in Spring 2023</a>. It got delayed to Fall 2023 and then further delayed into early 2025. You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> now.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breakers-roguelike-loop-didnt-engage-me-but-i-want-to-give-it-another-chance/1100-6524624/" data-ref-id="1100-6524624">Hyper Light Breaker preview,</a> Jordan Ramée wrote, "I feel like my big takeaway from my time with Hyper Light Breaker is that I need to give it another chance. This first impression wasn't very good... But games launch in early access for this very reason, and it's possible that most of my concerns won't be in the game when I play it again." In between Hyper Light games, developer Heart Machine released action platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a>.</p>

Mainly, that console playtesting was originally slated for Fall 2024, and now "it's here," and that there'll be more Black hairstyle customization options available in the final game.</p><p>Skate is a revival of the beloved skateboarding series, which has otherwise been dormant since Skate 3 released in 2010. It's being developed by Vancouver-based studio Full Circle. The staff includes Deran Chung and Cuz Parry, who previously worked on the three mainline games.</p><p>Sadly, there are no more substantial details about Skate for the time being. Those who are taking part in playtests can't share information about the game.

For the former, rewards include weapon and armor refining parts, an in-game hoodie layered equipment, and a collaboration guild card background. As for Wilds, you can get a gift code to redeem mega potions, energy drinks, dash juices, and other support items to aid your future hunts.</p><p>If you want to be up to date with each reward batch, make sure to log into Now every Monday in February from 9 AM (local time) to get a supply with item box expansions, potions, and the aforementioned refining parts. Some premium collaboration packs in the in-game shop will also be available from February 3 to February 28.</p><p>You can find more information about the collab event in the official <a href="https://monsterhunternow.com/en/news/collab-jan2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.
