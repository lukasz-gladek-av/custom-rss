                <p dir="ltr">Intellivision is getting a modern facelift, with the help of its old rival (in name) Atari. Loaded with 45 classic games, the Intellivision Sprint is a new system celebrating the original Atari 2600 competitor. Atari has opened up <a href="https://atari.com/products/intellivision-sprint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the console</a>, which will launch December 5 for $150.</p><p dir="ltr">Atari stated in a press release that Intellivision Sprint was created in partnership with Plaion. The new console features two wireless controllers and "a USB-A port for library expansion." The games collection already installed on the system includes Baseball, Soccer, Astrosmash, Boulder Dash, and Sea Battle. In addition, two controller overlays are part of the package for every single title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na6KVvxakMs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/na6KVvxakMs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We’re thrilled to celebrate Intellivision's 45th anniversary, and what better way to honor it than by bringing back this innovative console for fans to experience once again?

Before that, the <a href="https://amicoentertainment.com/" rel="nofollow ">Intellivision Amico</a> was the planned revival of the brand, which still hasn't been released yet (and will no longer bear the Intellivision name).</p><p dir="ltr">In late 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-preorder-guide/1100-6517171/">Atari launched the Atari 2600+</a>, refreshing the old system with new features like widescreen support.
