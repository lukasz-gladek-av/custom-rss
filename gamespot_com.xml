                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima/" data-ref-id="5000-693126">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> is the next chapter in the HoYoverse, and we've recently gotten more details about what the game is going to be about. The Honkai franchise has always been known for its anime-style graphics, quick and fluid combat, and addictive gameplay that keeps players coming back for more with every new installment. While Honkai: Nexus Anima is keeping many of those same elements, the developers are also changing up the core gameplay loop in some significant ways. Of course, you can still expect a similar feeling as the four previous games, but Nexus Anima is breathing some fresh ideas into the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't know everything about the new Honkai title, we've seen plenty of gameplay and heard enough details to get a good idea of what it has in store for the community. Below, you can see everything that we currently know about Honkai: Nexus Anima, including its release date, trailers, gameplay, and all other details in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Honkai: Nexus Anima be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, a release date for Honkai: Nexus Anima has not been announced by the developers at miHoYo. The game was only just recently formally announced on August 28, 2025, with some official screenshots, trailers, and information coming with that announcement.</p><p dir="ltr">However, no release date has been offered just yet. According to some rumors and how the development of the game is going, though, it seems like early 2026 is the most likely release window for Honkai: Nexus Anima at this time. Take that with a grain of salt, of course, as things can change drastically and we still don't know anything concrete.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Honkai: Nexus Anima</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the best parts about most new Honkai titles is that they are all free-to-play. The most recent game in the series, Honkai: Star Rail, was free-to-play at its launch in 2023, and that hasn't changed since.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, no preorders are necessary for Honkai: Nexus Anima, as you won't actually be able to purchase the game. This also means there are likely no editions for the game either. However, the developers haven't officially confirmed the free-to-play nature of the game, so Nexus Anima having a price tag attached to it can't be ruled out just yet. It would be a major change for the franchise if the game wasn't free-to-play, though.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Honkai: Nexus Anima Trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, there are two Honkai: Nexus Anima trailers you can watch that both come directly from the developer. One is a trailer for the private gameplay test that began in September, and the other is a gameplay trailer that showcases some of the new elements in Nexus Anima. You can watch both of them below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FV_6jirKU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5FV_6jirKU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first trailer, titled "Nexus Bond Teaser: Side by Side," is more of a cinematic trailer than anything. It features some of the characters and Anima that you'll see throughout the game. However, it mainly showcases the world that you'll get to explore, and the graphics are certainly a major highlight.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the second trailer, titled "In-game footage from Honkai: Nexus Anima," this is where we get into actual gameplay. The trailer shows off some of the gameplay mechanics that are being introduced with the game, as well as more characters and Anima. There's a look at the flying mechanic, a full-length battle, character creation, and a broader view of the world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Both of these trailers were released when Nexus Anima was announced in late August, and it's not currently known when a new trailer could arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As of right now, we know for sure that Honkai: Nexus Anima will be releasing on PC, iOS, and Android devices. This is the same trend that recent Honkai games have followed, but Honkai: Star Rail also eventually came to PlayStation 5. This occurred roughly six months following the game's initial release date.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if the developers have a console release date in mind for Nexus Anima. If the developers are planning a PS5 or Xbox version, though, we'll likely hear about it closer to the game's actual release date. Even then, we can assume that a console port wouldn't arrive until after the game launches on its standard platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Not too much about the story of Honkai: Nexus Anima has been revealed just yet. However, we do know the game takes place in a seaside town with dense urban elements. You can travel through the metropolis or take a stroll with your Anima down one of the several beach boulevards. The map in Nexus Anima seems to be quite large, so there's no shortage of places to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll also meet a variety of characters throughout the world, and many of them can be interacted with by you or your Anima. The main characters in Nexus Anima don't have too many details around them just yet, as the developers are likely waiting to reveal more of the main story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At its core, Honkai: Nexus Anima is a "creature-collector" game, which is akin to something like Pokémon. Players can head out into a large, open world and collect different creatures that will then be added to their party. These creatures are called "Anima."</p><p dir="ltr">While you can battle with these Anima and face off against other NPCs, your Anima aren't solely meant for that purpose. They also have utility during exploration and other areas, making your priorities for capturing one different from what they might be in a game like Pokémon. For example, some Anima are efficient at cleaning up the streets of the city by picking up trash, while others can actually work in stores and interact with potential customers. You can also level up your Anima, who all start at level 10, through a star-based system. Anima are leveled up through experience in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to battling, though, Anima have unique combat roles. These are defined by the Anima's in-game "Trait," which tells you more about how they will battle. One example of a Trait is the Gladiator, which likely means an Anima is going to be more fierce in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">To further help out Anima and customize them, each one has three gear slots that can be filled with gear you find out in the open world. Some gear will be more tailored to certain types of Anima, so it might be crucial to seek out that specific gear if you want to use one Anima in particular.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of using Anima, you don't have a traditional party of these creatures like in other games of this nature. Instead, Honkai: Nexus Anima uses a deck-building system that allows you to customize a deck of your acquired Anima. When you head into battle, you'll roll out the deck you've assembled based on real-time elements. Your deck won't be randomly rolled, so you can pick and choose which Anima appear in a battle depending on external factors.</p><p dir="ltr">Battling follows an auto-chess system, but there are several other elements that come into play as well. When a battle begins, you'll send out your Anima, and an "Animaster" will provide a buff to your creatures as combat starts. You can also utilize the assistance slots on the battlefield, which can be used by both teams and offer support in the form of healing, extra damage, etc.</p>

The company, completely by surprise, has released a new Fire Emblem game for mobile devices called Fire Emblem Shadows, and it’s an unlikely blend of strategy and social deduction.</p><p>Fire Emblem Shadows gives players control of a party of warriors, and asks them to choose between Light and Shadow.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is out now, and the series' first foray into Japan features many of its classic staples. This is noticeable early on during the <strong>altar puzzle</strong>, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the <strong>Silent Hill f altar puzzle</strong>.</p><h2>Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guide</h2><p>This first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-shrine-vault-puzzle-guide/1100-6534872/" data-ref-id="1100-6534872">shrine vault puzzle</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f locker codes</a>, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.</p><p>When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.</p><p>The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p><strong>Altar</strong></p><p>Thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.</p><p>Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.</p><p>A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.</p><p>Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.</p></div><p>If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them.

You'll be able to choose which of these to wear before the game begins, and you can change costumes at any time by visiting a Hokora (shrine) in-game and choosing "Change Costume".</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4565926-2947440_20250910194846_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4565926" data-ratio="0.55652173913043" data-width="2875" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4565926-2947440_20250910194846_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4565926"></a><figcaption>The Bonuses tab shows up after making a bit of progress in the game's campaign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4565926-2947440_20250910194846_1.png"></figure><p>To access your extra pre-order items, however, you'll need to advance a short way through the opening section of Silent Hill f. You'll come to a spot where you leave a home through a window and drop down from a rooftop, then you'll be told to return to the general store while avoiding enemies. As you work your way back through this area, you'll pass by a Hokora. From this point on, the Bonuses tab should unlock automatically when accessing one of these shrines. <strong>Open the Bonuses tab to obtain all of your pre-order items</strong>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>
