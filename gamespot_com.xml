                <p>Call of Duty's popular Nuketown map has been reimagined over and over again throughout the series, and the latest evolution of the map--focused on the stoner holiday of 4/20--has now been revealed. Activision also announced a variety of other extras coming to Black Ops 6 themed around marijuana.</p><p>The new Nuketown variant is called "Blazetown," and it'll be available in Black Ops 6 multiplayer with the Season 3 Reloaded update at some point in the future. It's likely it'll be available by 4/20. Activision has only shared one image of Blazetown, but it does confirm one of the buses is decked out with flower power.</p><p>Also coming to Black Ops 6 to celebrate all things ganja is a limited-time mode called Joint Operations. This includes five core mode variants, all with excellent names: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed).</p><p>The mode will make you trip out, eliciting "visual hallucinations" and sometimes shifting to a third-person POV to give you an out-of-body experience. The mode also includes double health and low gravity.</p><p>Finally, Activision announced that the popular stoners Jay and Silent Bob are coming to Black Ops 6 as playable characters. Players can deploy using their classic looks or their comic book versions--Bluntman and Chronic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186" data-ratio="0.56111111111111" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186"></a><figcaption>What a time to be alive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png"></figure><p>This DLC bundle includes the "Bluntman Stuntman" Krig C weapon and the "Chronic Unapologetic" Jackal PDW, along with the "Smoke You Out" finishing move, among other 4/20-themed items.</p><p>For more on Season 3, be sure to check out GameSpot's gallery below to see all the new content headed to Black Ops 6 soon.
