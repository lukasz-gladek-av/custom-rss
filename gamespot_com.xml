                <p>In 2021, PUBG publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-developer-krafton-acquires-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds/1100-6497553/" data-ref-id="1100-6497553">Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds</a>, the studio behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/subnautica-review-a-water-wonderland/1900-6416847/" data-ref-id="1900-6416847">Subnautica</a>. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-officially-announced-with-four-player-co-op-coming-in-2025/1100-6527239/" data-ref-id="1100-6527239">Subnautica 2</a>, began development roughly a year later. But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill. Now, Cleveland has shared a message for fans about his ouster and where Subnautica 2 currently stands.</p><p>In an extended post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Cleveland wrote "the events of this week have been quite a shock" in addition to recapping the history of Unknown Worlds, which began with a Half-Life mod called Natural Selection. Krafton's announcement of Cleveland's departure suggested <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/subnautica-studio-leadership-gutted-by-krafton-which-outright-says-that-subnautica-2-needs-renewed-energy-and-momentum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that Subnautica 2 isn't ready for early access</a>, an assertion that the director denies.</p><p>"We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it," said Cleveland. "And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists. That led to <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a response from Unknown Worlds</a> which asks players for patience and notes that most of Subnautica 2's developers remain with the project.</p>

Duke Nukem and Tomb Raider's Lara Croft will be getting their own personalized tanks as they headline two separate Heroes' Paths chapters from July 10 to July 21. According the launch trailer below, Lara's chapter will have 30 stages while Duke's will have 40.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wmRci2g_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2wmRci2g_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Keeley Hawes is reprising her role as Lara Croft from a handful of Tomb Raider games that were released before the 2013 reboot, as well as Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Although Lara isn't known for using a tank, her vehicle of choice in this game is a Tier VIII U.S. versatile medium tank that comes with a lot of Lara's archeology tools including her hatchet, ropes, cables, a winch, and more.</p><p>Jon St. John--the original and only voice of Duke Nukem--is also stepping back into his iconic role for this guest appearance. Unlike Lara, Duke riding in a tank feels very much in character. His ride is a nuclear-powered TS-6, a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. Understandably, it comes with a lot of Duke's heavy ordinance including laser machine guns, grenade launchers, and other "enhanced weapons systems."</p><p>Duke and Lara's stages will include several nods to their respective histories with returning characters, cosmetics, and collectibles. A new Lara Croft theme was created for this event, while Duke Nukem's Grabbag theme will be used in his portion of the game.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Lesta Games--the Russian studio behind Mir Tankov, an offshoot of World of Tanks--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-studio-seized-by-russia-accused-of-supporting-ukraine/1100-6532140/" data-ref-id="1100-6532140">accused by Russia of illegally funneling money from its title to Ukraine</a>. Wargaming--the studio behind World of Tanks--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">hasn't hidden its support for Ukraine</a> in the war against Russia. However, Wargaming and Lesta Games are no longer tied together, despite the allegations.</p>

                <p>Amazon is sweetening the pot for Prime members ahead of Prime Day on July 8, offering four free bonus games members will be able to claim free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, the free games claimed are yours to keep, even if your Amazon Prime subscription lapses. This batch of games includes titles from two of the biggest IPs in the world, Star Wars and Marvel, a critically acclaimed horror game, and the latest installment in an ever-popular sports management series. The four games will be free starting July 8, and will be available for redemption through GOG (in the case of the Star Wars game) or the Epic Games Store.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Prime Gaming Free Prime Day Bonus Games Starting July 8</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II (GOG)</li><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Epic Games Store)</li><li dir="ltr">Marvel's Midnight Suns (Epic Games Store)</li><li dir="ltr">Football Manager 2024 (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It is worth nothing that Football Manager 2024 will be available only during the Prime Day period, which ends on Friday, July 11 at 11:59 p.m. PST, so make sure to claim it by then.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's not a bad selection of titles. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-39">Dark Forces II</a> is definitely the least appreciated of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, it's still an enjoyable, old-school FPS romp. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent/" data-ref-id="5000-59725">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> is one of the best horror games of the last two decades (it sports an 85 on Metacritic). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns/" data-ref-id="5000-536957">Midnight Suns</a> didn't meet sale expectations when it released in 2022, but it's still worth playing for fans of the tactics genre and comes from the creators of the legendary XCOM series. Football Manager is also a great get, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/football-manager-25-canceled-after-multiple-delays-dev-moves-on-to-next-game/1100-6529311/" data-ref-id="1100-6529311">Football Manager 2025 was recently canceled</a>, making this the latest game in the series until it presumably returns sometime next year.</p><p dir="ltr">These four games aren't the only freebies Prime members can claim in July. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-7-free-games-in-july/1100-6532812/" data-ref-id="1100-6532812">Amazon previously announced seven other free games</a>, though many of them are probably ones you haven't heard of before.

                <p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the biggest releases of 2025 so far, earning positive reviews and selling over 3 million copies since arriving in March. If you’ve yet to check out the latest epic from Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is getting its first big discount for Prime Day, and you can pick up the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D47WHMQD,B0D47WTKPM&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Limited Edition</a> for $47.50 (normally $70). That’s the best price we’ve ever seen for the game, which has rarely dipped below $70. This Amazon-exclusive version includes the <strong>Sekiryu Character Pack</strong>, offering legendary gear and weapons, plus a mount and trinket. Prime Day runs from July 8-11, so you only have a few days to pick this deal up--assuming it doesn't sell out before then. The deal applies to the PS5 and Xbox versions.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin’s Creed Shadows review</a> gave it an 8/10, praising Naoe’s fluid movement system and engaging stealth gameplay. The world is also an absolute blast to explore, thanks to changing seasons and plenty of dramatic vistas.</p><p>“Naoe's gameplay is the best that the series has felt since the transition to a more action-RPG format--Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute blast to play,” wrote critic Jordan Ramée. “Shadows feels like a world that Ubisoft Quebec has made its own…Shadows keeps its open fields and winding roads interesting with picturesque views, amusing conversations from the odd passerby, and a world that feels more alive than Origins' Egypt or Odyssey's Greece, because it changes and evolves with the seasons.”</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Books</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521446" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521446"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows Deluxe Guide and Deluxe Art Book</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4521446-mixcollage-25-jun-2025-09-32-am-853.jpg"></figure><p>Looking to dive deeper into the expansive world of Assassin’s Creed?
