                <p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red is reciprocating the love Balatro showed Cyberpunk 2077 a couple of months ago by adding a quest based on the roguelike card game. It's one of the new secrets that's now discoverable in Night City after the recent launch of Update 2.2 for the action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Balatro account <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866815234410749984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> teased the crossover, showcasing that the poker-inspired game's joker mascot--named Jimbo--appears as graffiti in Cyberpunk 2077 now. That led to CD Projekt Red global PR director Radek Grabowski revealing that the collaboration is official and part of a new in-game quest.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: "You liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro? What if we had Balatro cards in Cyberpunk 2077?" Thanks to the talented quest designer Maria Mazur, we now have the Balatro quest in Update 2.2," explained Grabowski <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866824502988185901" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>.

                <p>Actor Rob Wiethoff famously portrayed John Marston in Rockstar's acclaimed 2010 Red Dead Redemption, and now he's starting a new project that is completely different and unexpected. Wiethoff, 48, has launched an OnlyFans, but it's not <em>that kind </em>of OnlyFans. After fans discovered he had an OnlyFans set up, Wietoff released a video responding to what he described as "panic" surrounding this.</p><p>"I have an OnlyFans page. I do," Wietoff told his 200,000 followers on Instagram in a video address. It costs $5/month to subscribe. Wiethoff's OnlyFans account will be focused on his own personal health journey as he looks to get lean and ripped.</p><p>"There will be nothing but me trying to get in shape. If you want to be part of that, you are welcome to join," he said. "I know what OnlyFans is. Not everything on there has to be that kind of content. That is not what my content is going to be. If you want to get ripped with an old-timer, sign up; that's it."</p><p>In addition to voicing John Marston in the original Red Dead, Wiethoff came back to play the character once again in Red Dead Redemption II, which is a prequel to the first game.</p><p>In other Red Dead news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-solid-pc-port-shows-how-red-dead-still-holds-up-in-2024/1100-6527663/" data-ref-id="1100-6527663">original game finally came to PC earlier this year with its Undead Nightmare expansion.</a> Rockstar Games is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is set for release in Fall 2025.

Crusade, in the year 1937. Players take on the iconic role of Indiana Jones as they try to stop evil forces from obtaining a power known as The Great Circle.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_video_games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lots of Indiana Jones video games over the years</a>, and The Great Circle is the first title for console since Lego Indiana Jones 2 in 2011.</p><p>Also in the interview, Reilly shared more insight on how Lucasfilm interacts with game developers working on its properties. "We don't tell the teams how to run development. We don't tell them how to run their day-to-day of the business," he said.</p><p>For The Great Circle, Lucasfilm was involved in making sure the game "looks, feels, [and] sounds like Indiana Jones," and that included approving the casting of Troy Baker as Indiana Jones himself.</p><p>"Between the work MachineGames did in representing him physically and the absolutely stunning work Troy has done voicing the character, you forget it's not Harrison when you play it. He's that good," Reilly said.</p><p>Whether or not another Indiana Jones game from MachineGames or anyone else gets made likely has to do, in part, with the commercial success of The Great Circle. Microsoft doesn't typically announce sales numbers, and the fact that The Great Circle is also on Game Pass doesn't make it easy to understand how the game is performing. On Steam, The Great Circle is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as a top-seller </a>and has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2677660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached 12,000 concurrent players there</a>. It is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/top-paid/games/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not inside the top 500 games on Xbox's top paid games list</a>, but there are plenty of reasons for why this could be.</p><p>The Great Circle began development prior to Microsoft's acquisition of MachineGames via its buyout of parent company ZeniMax. Making The Great Circle exclusive to Xbox at launch is expected to amount to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost sales</a>, Microsoft has said. The Great Circle is scheduled to come to PS5 in Spring 2025.</p>
