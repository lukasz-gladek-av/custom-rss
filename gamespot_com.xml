                <p>Epic Games Publishing announced Wiredfly and Kong Orange's Out of Words during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, a co-op side-scrolling action-adventure game. The characters have lost their mouths--and the ability to speak--and must work together during their colorful journey as they engage with a variety of challenges. A distinguishing feature is that all of the characters and environments have been crafted and animated using traditional, physical stop-motion animation, with the trailer showing part of the creation process for characters.</p><p>The game is based on an original concept by Danish poet Morten Søndergaard. The two leads, Kurt and Karla, find themselves in the fantastical realm of Vokabulantis, where they must work together to overcome the various challenges in their way. While the two are described as "friends," there are hints that the game will see their relationship blossom in a more romantic way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdOLvr2MQjI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gdOLvr2MQjI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game features both online and local co-op play. Despite the leads' wordless nature in-game, you'll need to communicate with your co-op partner in order to solve puzzles. Puzzles shown in the trailer include elements like shifting gravity and using a grappling device to traverse the side-scrolling landscapes.</p><p>Out of Words is planned for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via the Epic Games Store. No details on potential cross-play or a release date have yet been given.</p>

Announced for Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR headsets, this new game will see players control the merc with a mouth--voiced by actor Neil Patrick Harris--as he takes on classic villains like X-Men villains like Mojo and Lady Deathstrike.</p><p>Developer Twisted Pixel, known for a few other funny games, like 'Splosion Man, announced the game with a trailer that captures a lot of Deadpool's ridiculous banter, as well as a bunch of the flippy-shooty mayhem you'll get up to in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jof1MtYccs?si=p2Jj-77huVQLPq-U" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Watch it right here</a>.</p><p>The game features an all-new, original Deadpool story that finds the quippy hero sucked through a portal to Mojoworld, where he's tasked with traveling across the Marvel universe to take on a bunch of villains. Gameplay combines shooting, stabbing, and parkour, and also looks to let you to leverage Deadpool's regenerative superpowers so you can get blown up and dismembered yourself, if that's what it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool is set to launch later this year.</p><p>This isn't the first time that a VR game based on an iconic comic book character has been announced for Quest headsets, as last year saw the release of the highly acclaimed Batman: Arkham Shadow.

                <p>A release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462" data-mce-href="/games/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was officially revealed during Summer Game Fest 2025, and this new chapter in Techland's open-world zombie series will arrive on August 22 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The standalone adventure sees the return of Kyle Crane, Dying Light's original protagonist, and is set in the rural location of Castor Woods. After escaping from a decade in captivity and the horrific experiments performed on him by the Baron, Crane makes his way to the once-bustling tourist destination in search of vengeance and finds it overrun with zombies.</p><p>Like previous games, the infected people stalking the streets during the day will be the least of your worries, because once the sun sets, the worst of the zombie horde comes out to play. Fortunately, Crane has parkour skills and an off-road vehicle to help him outrun enemies, and when push comes to shove, the zombie DNA in his blood gives him an edge in combat.</p><p>Techland's new trailer showed off Crane's savage side, as he can now tap into his rage-fueled powers to smash through zombies. If brute force isn't enough, Crane can also make use of various melee weapons and firearms to even the odds. Priced at $60 for the standard edition, preorders will unlock the Hero of Harran Bundle. This includes the following DLC:</p><ul><li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li><li>Harran Combat Knife</li><li>The Follower Crossbow</li><li>In Jade’s Memory Pistol</li><li>Castor Woods Patrol</li></ul><p>Dying Light: The Beast is just one of several big reveals from Summer Game Fest 2025, and for more, you can check out our feature on all the announcements from the annual gaming showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest Live</a> with Geoff Keighley, Yacht Club Games announced that Mina The Hollower, its first new in-house IP since introducing Shovel Knight to the world in 2019, will launch on Halloween--and there's a free limited-time demo available on Steam right now.</p><p dir="ltr">Mina The Hollower is an action-adventure game made in the style of Game Boy Color-era games like The Legend Of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/Ages. Players control the titular Mina, a mouse who's handy with a whip, as she travels through a spooky island in an attempt to save it from a dreadful curse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KT4R9pu1Ew" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The demo was released on Steam in conjunction with the release-date announcement, and it is part of the annual Steam Next Fest celebration, which ends on June 16th. The demo contains the game's opening stage and first major boss fight, and all progress made in the demo will carry over to the main game when it launches in the fall.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Mina was first announced in February 2022 as part of a Yacht Club Presents livestream presentation. Yacht Club's last update on the game was during last year's Yacht Club Presents, where Yacht Club's Alec Faulkner walked through some of the game's top features.</p><p dir="ltr">Yacht Club Games has been busy outside of Mina The Hollower, however, as the studio has released multiple updates for roguelike Shovel Knight Dig and puzzler Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon. Another Shovel Knight project, the upgraded Shovel Of Hope DX, was announced during a Nintendo Indie World last year as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Mina The Hollower launches October 31, but PC is the only platform confirmed as of this writing.</p>
