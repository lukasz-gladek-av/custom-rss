                <p>At GDC 2025, I watched a walkthrough of one of the early levels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>, the next game from Heart Machine. The studio typically goes for action games but mixes in a little bit of something else--2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a> had RPG elements, 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a> was an adventure-platformer, and 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a cooperative roguelike. Possessor(s) is a metroidvania or, as Heart Machine prefers to call it, a search-action game (which, honestly, is such a better term for the genre).</p><p dir="ltr">A sidescroller, Possessor(s) sees you play as two characters: Luca, a teenage girl, and Rehm, the demon possessing her. I didn't get to see the events that led to their partnership, but the Heart Machine team explained that the start of Possessor(s) sees Luca caught up in an interdimensional catastrophe that rips a hole in the sky and kills everyone she loves--it's only because of the intervention of the strange horned man now within her that she survives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289"></a><figcaption>During Luca and Rehm's journey, they'll encounter objects possessed by feral demons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rehm also gives Luca artificial legs (I don't know what happened to her original legs, but I assume the full game will clue us in), so that she can jump higher and survive falls from any height, and Luca uses these new prosthetics to navigate the now-quarantined city in hopes of escaping it and learning more about how the catastrophe happened. The duo regularly converse about their substantially different views of demons and the corporation responsible for most everything in the city, alleviating much of the sense of loneliness that I've come to expect in other search-action games.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Rehm, Luca is able to hold her own in a world that wants to kill her. Combat is against the possessed objects and people of the city--demons far more feral than Rehm have corrupted all manner of things in the metropolis. I was surprised when a potted plant that had been pretending to be totally inanimate and harmless sprung to life right as Luca walked past it, and the devs said that plenty of demons will adopt that strategy of hiding in plain sight by pretending to be seemingly normal parts of the world. When a fight does break out, mechanically, it looks a whole lot like playing Super Smash Bros., with an emphasis on combos and air juggles. It looks more engaging than Hyper Light Breaker, but I didn't get hands-on time with Possessor(s) so I can't say one way or the other for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290"></a><figcaption>As Luca unlocks new traversal abilities, she and Rehm will be able to reach more areas of the map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its genre contemporaries, Luca unlocks additional abilities over time, which open up new options in combat and open up new areas of the map. I didn't get a chance to see this in action, but it sounds like it works just like how upgrades are handled in the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nine-sols/" data-ref-id="5000-548741">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a>, and other similar games, with an open-ended, interconnected world that allows players to explore in whichever direction they have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Stylistically, Possessor(s) is the biggest departure from Hyper Light Drifter's visuals--not bad by any means, but surprising all the same since every subsequent game from the studio has followed that art direction pretty closely. The colors are certainly similar, but Possessor(s)'s characters look hand-drawn, and bolder lines and flashier colors for the animations make attacks and movements appear like something from a comic book or manga. It's very cool, and at least in terms of art direction, Possessor(s) is my favorite of Heart Machine's games. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the game intrigues me all the same, and I can't wait to jump into it myself later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) is set to launch for PS5 and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

Those who earn the most points after the challenge concludes will be rewarded with prizes.</p><p>Sony San Diego has collaborated with the American sports and comedy group Dude Perfect for this week's Impossible Fastball Challenge of the Week. It'll run from April 4 at 12 PM PT / 3PM ET to April 11 at 11:59 AM PT / 2:59 AM ET. Players will need an internet connection and must be at least 18 years old to win the prizes:</p><ul><li>1st place: Paul Skenes autographed The Show ball</li><li>2nd place: Elly De La Cruz autographed The Show ball</li><li>3rd place: Gunner Henderson autographed The Show ball</li><li>4th – 10th place: 50,000 Stubs</li><li>11th – 20th place: 40,000 Stubs</li><li>21st – 40th place: 30,000 Stubs</li><li>41st – 100th place: 10 Challenge of the Week Exclusive Packs</li></ul><p>Players will play as Elly De La Cruz against a CPU-controlled Paul Skenes who throws a 200MPH fastball and rack up as many points as possible within three outs. GameSpot has attempted this challenge and it seems like players will literally need to swing the instant the pitch leaves Paul Skenes' hand in order to make contact with the ball.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 is now available on PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earlier today, Nintendo made the unprecedented decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">delay prerelease orders</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/">Switch 2</a> in the US in order for the company to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." The news follows the Trump Administration announcing its plan to implement <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5345802/trump-tariffs-liberation-day" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">steep and controversial tariffs</a> across the globe, with nations such as Japan, Vietnam, China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU facing the worst of these trade penalties. But while Nintendo might be the first company to address the impact these tariffs will have on production, the Entertainment Software Association--the video game industry's trade association that represents most of its major publishers--suspects that this is just the beginning.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that the tariffs being announced the same day as the Switch 2's pricing reveal was "just unfortunate coincidental timing," and that Americans "aren't taking it seriously" if we think think it's just the Switch 2 that will impacted by tariffs.</p><p>"It's been interesting with media coverage around video games and tariffs because just unfortunate coincidental timing that the Switch [2 reveal] was the same day as President Trump's announcement. There are so many devices we play video games on. There are other consoles, but as I was saying, VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games, if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact," Quinn said. </p><p>“Even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”</p><p>Quinn added that she expects that the "entire consumer ecosystem" will be affected by these tariffs, as higher prices and a volatile economy means consumers are less likely to spend. This will in turn impact company revenue, job security, research and development, and "even what the next generation of consoles will look like," IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine noted.</p><p>Like consumers--and the media, for that matter--Quinn said the ESA is still trying to figure out exactly how things will play out and just how big said impact will be. Though the organization assumed these tariffs were coming due to Trump's past actions and campaign promises, they are unsure how things will ultimately play out and are "trying not to have knee-jerk reactions."</p><p>"We don't think that what President Trump announced this week is the end of the story, but what was announced this week and the tariffs as outlined, we do expect these tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on the industry and the hundreds of millions of Americans who love to play games,” Quinn said. “Our goal is to work with the administration, to work with other elected officials to try to find a solution that doesn't damage U.S. industries, U.S. business, but also American gamers and families.”</p><p>Fortunately, Quinn said that there are actions concerned citizens can take that that might make an impact. Reaching out to your representatives--be it through letters, calls, emails, tweets, or other forms of communication--is an effective method for ensuring that elected officials and their staff "hear that their constituents are concerned." Quinn also stated that members of the ESA have met with the Trump Administration, White House employees, and members of the United States Trade Representative, and are having conversations regarding these tariffs and their impact on the video games industry.</p><p>For months now, experts have speculated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/#comments-block-33629463" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">President Trump's proposed tariffs</a> would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">significant ramifications</a> for the gaming industry. While some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage companies such as Nintendo to produce in the United States, Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p>
