                <p>With Fortnite and other Epic mobile titles finally returning to iOS soon after five years, Epic Games is marking the occasion by introducing a major bonus for those who spend money on its games: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/better-deals-in-fortnite-and-more-players-get-20-back-in-epic-rewards-starting-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20% back in rewards cash</a> on all purchases in Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys made using Epic's own payment system in the Epic Games Store, a massive boost from the 5% it normally offers. Even better is that this change is permanent, and is already live.</p><p>But that's not all--that 20% cash back will apply to <em>all</em> purchases made through EGS until the end of August. If that percentage seems extraordinarily high, that's because it is. Under these terms, buying a new $70 game will net $14 in credit that you can use on anything in the Epic Games Store aside from subscriptions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243" data-ratio="0.56239217941346" data-width="1739" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491243"></a><figcaption>The new option that will be presented to Fortnite players when they purchase V-Bucks on iPhone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4491243-epicrewars20percent%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's motivation for this move is to encourage players to spend money with them directly rather than going through, say, Apple's App Store, which takes its own healthy percentage from every purchase made. For Fortnite specifically, Apple would take 30% off every purchase of V-Bucks--offering 20% back in rewards, by contrast, gives Epic the full purchase amount aside from normal transaction fees, and since the rewards cash can only be spent on the Epic Games Store it hypothetically keeps players invested in the company's ecosystem.</p><p>When players on iOS attempt to purchase V-Bucks now, they're given the option of doing so through the App Store or by using Epic's own payment systems, with the Epic option showing how much you'd earn in rewards. The Epic Rewards credit is applied to your account two weeks after the relevant purchase has been made, and once you've got it you can spend it on anything other than subscriptions. Meaning you can earn this 20% cash back by subscribing to Fortnite Crew, but you cannot use the store credit to pay for a Crew subscription.</p><p>This option is only for people who use Fortnite on PC, mobile or streaming--folks on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch will not have the option to pay Epic directly when they buy V-Bucks on those platforms. But console players can still use the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite web shop</a> and earn the 20% cash back that way.</p><p>It's a convenient moment for this change for a lot of Fortnite fans, as Mace Windu will be arriving in the Fortnite item shop this evening--the first new Star Wars item shop skin released during the current Star Wars season.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 | Animated Collaboration Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossover will begin on May 20 with a total of eight character skins, significantly more than recent collabs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2s-gundam-wing-collab-was-informed-by-gunpla/1100-6531147/" data-ref-id="1100-6531147">Gundam Wing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>. Below is the full list of Overwatch characters who will be getting the Street Fighter treatment.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kirkio as Juri</li><li dir="ltr">Widowmaker as Cammy</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each skin can be briefly glimpsed in the animated trailer and looks to capture the spirit of Capcom's fighting game perfectly. Sigma as M. Bison and Zenyatta as Dhalsim are no-brainers, and Hanzo being Japanese is a great fit for Ryu.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not released exact details on pricing or what freebies players will be able to score as part of the event, but the end of the trailer does show Hanzo performing a Hadoken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku. That may mean each collab skin will come bundled with a few of each Street Fighter character's signature moves in the form of emotes, but fans will have to wait a little longer for more information.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-16-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6495/" data-ref-id="2900-6495">Overwatch 2 recently saw the start of Season 16</a>, which introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">damage hero, Freya</a>, and added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">third-person Stadium mode</a>. Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 will receive a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/street-fighter-6-elena-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6465935/" data-ref-id="2300-6465935">playable fighter, Elena</a>, on June 5.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>'s new features is GameChat, a feature so important that Nintendo created a dedicated button, the C button, for it. There are quite a few things to know about GameChat for Switch 2, so we're rounding up everything we've learned so far ahead of the Switch 2 launch on June 5.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_GameChat_"><strong>What is GameChat?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat is a new feature for the Switch 2 that allows groups of up to 12 people to chat while playing games. Nintendo is often criticized for being late to the game when it comes to online functionality, and many have pointed out that GameChat offers what Discord has for years. But GameChat is a built-in service for Switch 2 that Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">working on since 2020</a>, and the company believes it is a "defining" feature of the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's developers said the company wanted to replicate the experience of a "student lounge," that is, a place where people gather and mingle.</p><p dir="ltr">For GameChat on Switch 2, people can share their screens in real time, and they don't have to be playing the same game. Nintendo said, "We wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it foresees the possibility of players using GameChat to help them get through a particularly challenging puzzle or part of a game. If two people are playing the same game but separately, one person can ask a friend for help, and the other person can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">share their screen.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_C_Button"><strong>The C Button</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it believed it would be "bothersome" to have to pause a game, return to the Home screen, and then launch a GameChat session. So the designers convinced the hardware team to create a dedicated button, the C button, to launch GameChat from. Nintendo's designers said this was a "very last-minute request," and it was made "just before" the Joy-Con controller molds were made. As you can see in the image below, the C button is located at the bottom of the right Joy-Con.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211" data-ratio="0.53649956024626" data-width="1137" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211"></a><figcaption>Behold, the C button (effect added). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Camera_And_Microphone_Support"><strong>Camera And Microphone Support</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat for Switch 2 leverages the console's built-in microphone, while users can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">connect a USB-C camera</a> for video chats. Nintendo is selling its own Switch 2 camera, while a third-party company is offering a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-official-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6530549/"> Piranha Plant-themed camera. </a>The built-in microphone contains noise-cancelling technology so only the desired sounds come through.

As you can see in the image below, GameChat allows users to have multiple feeds at the bottom of their main screen, showing what friends are up to. In some games, like Mario Kart World, your friend's faces can be placed next to their characters, so you can see them during matches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216" data-ratio="0.57327586206897" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216"></a><figcaption>What GameChat looks like on Switch 2 with the camera and different games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="GameChat_Won_t_Be_Free_Forever"><strong>GameChat Won't Be Free Forever</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the Switch 2 launches in June, everyone can use GameChat for free. However, GameChat will become a paid service included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-when-nintendo-switch-2-launches/2900-6407/" data-ref-id="2900-6407">Nintendo Switch Online</a> beginning April 1, 2026. Some have speculated that Nintendo is going to raise the price of Nintendo Switch Online memberships, too, but that hasn't happened yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that GameChat will be a paid Nintendo Switch Online feature in 2026, the C button will be useless for people who don't have a paid membership. Rest assured, though, that pressing the C button without a membership <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/">will not lead to anything bad happening.</a> Instead, pressing the button will take you to a page encouraging you to sign up for NSO.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Video_Quality"><strong>Video Quality</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">During the April Nintendo Direct for Switch 2, Nintendo showed off GameChat and many people remarked that the video quality didn't look all that great. The frame rate, in particular, was choppy to say the least. Nintendo explained that it<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/"> intentionally made GameChat the smallest footprint possible</a> to save system resources for the games themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">"In order to explain this well, I think it might first help to explain about the resources the system has," Switch 2 hardware director Takuhiro Dohta said, via a translator. "So obviously, chat is meant to run and work simultaneously and coincide with the game you're playing. But we also think it's critical that it doesn't get in the way of the game that's running right now. And so we wanted to definitely make sure we do was to make sure that running game chat alongside the game doesn't result in the game experience or quality being reduced at all in any way.</p><p dir="ltr">"So from a system resource perspective, obviously even the Nintendo Switch had a set of system resources that it needed to tap into to run the system. And now that we have Nintendo Switch 2, there is bigger, more, basically resource budget to use. However, even with that enhanced and larger budget, we try to use as little of that as possible. And they made it happen somehow. And within that small slice of the resource budget, there's other things to take into consideration, like network systems, all that kind of stuff, and all of that taking into account is where we landed in terms of quality of the video that you saw in the footage."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Safety_Concerns"><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo previously outlined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-camera-nintendo-responds-to-safety-and-spying-concerns/1100-6530594/">steps being taken</a> to ensure safety when using GameChat, including audio and video chats. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-clarifies-how-and-why-switch-2-could-collect-monitor-and-record-your-gamechats/1100-6531419/" data-ref-id="1100-6531419">may collect and record video and audio chats</a>, but only in the event that a report is filed; otherwise, the data is stored locally on the Switch 2 device. To begin with, players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p dir="ltr">"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Switch 2 designer Sumikazu Ono said. "With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat."</p><p dir="ltr">If you join a room created by a friend, players will only see people you or your friend have approved from GameChat. Before joining a room, players will see if a friend of a friend is in the room--if they don't want to join for any reason, they don't have to.</p><p dir="ltr">With regard to protecting the safety of children, Ono said Nintendo had a "lot of internal discussion" on this topic--it was decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list if their parent or guardian has given permission via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo takes an "even more cautious" approach for video chats. "When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent's app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritize safety and require parents to approve the request every time," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a "privacy shutter" that closes when not in use--as such, players should be able to see at a glance if the camera is on or off.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the Community Guidelines, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_The_Switch_2"><strong>Preorder The Switch 2</strong></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, priced at $450 by itself or $500 for a bundle that includes the system and a copy of Mario Kart World.
