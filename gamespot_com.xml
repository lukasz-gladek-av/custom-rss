With The Edge of Fate, the first chapter of the new story arc Bungie calls the Fate Saga, the developer introduced a very new, very different kind of character, named Lodi. Your main point of contact in the expansion's destination, Kepler, Lodi has a deep, strange backstory that introduces a whole lot of new elements to the game's story and lore.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Lodi, it turns out, is a time traveler, kidnapped from his place in the distant past of the 1960s and flung through centuries as part of an unknown agenda. That makes him a different kind of character than Destiny 2 usually sees--his frame of reference is a lot closer to the people playing the game than the immortal Guardians who populate it. He's also much more of a "regular guy" than any of the characters the game has told stories about up to now, and that makes him something of an interesting anomaly in Destiny 2's world.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Edge of Fate, Lodi is portrayed by actor Brian Villalobos, a newcomer to the game. Since taking on the role, Villalobos has been immersing himself more in the Destiny 2 world, and has even taken to streaming the game on Twitch (his brother, Michael, is the well-known Dark Souls streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lobosjrgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LobosJr</a>). GameSpot spoke with Villalobos via email about the experience of taking on the role of Lodi and finding the humanity in the character amid the space magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: I've seen that you're streaming Destiny 2--how familiar were you with the game and its story when you took on the role of Lodi? What was your process like for getting into the character and finding his place in the Destiny world, and how did your familiarity with the game play into that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Brian Villalobos: </strong>I was <em>not </em>very familiar. So, I'm not necessarily a <em>gigantic</em> gamer--my younger brother's a big, big Dark Souls streamer and he got me into that whole beautiful nightmare for a while, and he'd played Destiny a bit, but I never had. I got the notice that I was cast just over a year ago, and I'd obviously heard of Destiny, and I knew it was a huge, long-standing franchise, and I have friends who've been playing it forever, but I really only knew it as a "space shooter." I thought you just loaded up with friends and went in and blew up robots and aliens or whatever. (Aside from that, I think I maybe knew Nathan Fillion was in it? Haha.)</p><p dir="ltr">What really, truly surprised me and blew me away once I started digging in was the profound depth and breadth of the storytelling, and of these characters and lore. There's a whole cosmology. There's like, space magic; space <em>religions</em>, kind of; cohabitating peoples and societies; a winding military history; Eldritch interdimensional meddling--it instantly felt as expansive and deep as something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. So, <em>that</em> part of it--which, as an actor preparing to try to somehow step into that world, was the first part I engaged with and was the first part I really fell in love with--I was not at all familiar with. Which, honestly, in a weird way, played right into the prep for Lodi: One of the very fortunate things about him--and I've been incredibly, incredibly fortunate in so many ways with this dude--is that he's this Timelost, Stranger In a Strange Land kind of guy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, I prepped--I mean, I played the game, I mainlined lore videos and Destiny storylines and did background stuff and all that--but so much of him, <strong>a.)</strong> felt like it was so clearly and beautifully on the page, and <strong>b.)</strong> was rooted in this kind of thing where it's like, "Okay, welcome to Destiny, you're playing this astonishingly regular-ass-seeming guy who's kind of constantly overwhelmed and confused by everything, but very interested by this massive preexisting fantastical future-world that he's just been thrust into, and he kind of has no idea what's going on and is in over his head and really doesn't want to screw things up, but he's just doing his best." And I was like, "Yep. Okay. I can <em>fully</em> relate to that."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi has some pretty heavy stuff to contend with, as a guy who was abducted by aliens, sent to the future, and now is getting his brain messed with. There are a few moments where a lot of anguish comes through in your portrayal. Can you talk about the challenges of capturing that emotional range? How do you channel all that sort of unknowable weirdness to get to the humanity of such an out-there situation?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Man, it was just <em>so </em>much fun. So, so much fun. Honestly. There's a ton of massive-scale weirdness, but that's just what makes this role such a dream--it sucks I can't spoil, but there are things I got to do as Lodi that I literally never, ever, <em>ever</em> would have imagined I'd get to do as an actor. Ever. <em>Ever</em>. Haha. The stakes are huge, everything matters in a cosmic, existence-in-the-balance way, but also, he's just a guy. Dealing with all of it. And he's smart, and adaptable, and kind, and open, which are all wonderful, useful tools, but also, someone just flipped the sheets of reality and spacetime on him, and he's got to take it all in and survive and integrate without letting his face twitch and giving him away. But I think with anything, as an actor, what you have, always and obviously, is the writing, and the thoughts and emotions and experiences of the character. And, if you're lucky, the eyes of another actor, which, for the cinematic stuff, I was very, very lucky: We got to do performance capture in Stockholm with multiple teams of wonderful people, including two truly amazingly gifted actors, Allyson Kulavis and Richard Sloniker--who are Destiny legends and, aside from voicing characters in the game, have done the physical and facial performances of so many characters over the life of the series--who made my job so very much easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We started with [performance capture], which was fantastic, so I had Allyson and Richard as scene partners (and patient, expert PCap mentors, because I'd never done it) to help ground the performance. All I had to do was lose myself in what I imagined Lodi was thinking and feeling and look at their eyes and what they were experiencing, and I was there. And so then, when we did all the booth-recording sessions over the past year, I had that week in Sweden with the team and Allyson and Richard as a foundation, which was such a help, because you're just in a booth by yourself imagining things.</p><p dir="ltr">As for humanity: The humanity is in the writing. Really. The narrative team on Edge of Fate is incredible (and kind!), and they not only created what was, for me, an instantly relatable character; they were immensely supportive--they had a very clear direction in mind, and everything was very precisely scripted, but they also made me feel very, very free to bring my own natural cadences and pauses and vocal idiosyncrasies, and really my whole self and personality to Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">Early on, I knew the scope of this story was huge--there are almost-incomprehensible cosmic elements, there's interstellar time travel and unknowable space-deities and space wizards and the end of existence, not to mention that it's Destiny, so there are 10-years-plus of incredible performances and storytelling and an incredible, passionate community and tradition and just a whole, whole lot available there that I could choose to pressure myself to live up to if I wanted to. But I'll give myself credit for one thing, which is that I pretty instinctively felt like looking at any of that in that way wasn't part of the job. The job is this guy, and what he's thinking and feeling. What he <em>says</em> isn't even my job. That's taken care of. Just be open, and trust, and don't put any judgment or anything extra on it, and <em>trust</em>, and take a step into the unknown. And trust. Kinda like the guy himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275" data-ratio="0.56296296296296" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi is a really interesting character within the scope of Destiny 2 also, because he's maybe the most fish-out-of-water anyone can be, and anyone </strong><em><strong>has</strong></em><strong> been, in Destiny 2--but he also has to be authoritative in some ways, guiding the player through the course of the story. So what was it like trying to balance those two aspects?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Again, it's kinda like the job itself. And in a way, kind of like any job an actor walks into. To paraphrase the brilliant and kind Alison Lührs, Bungie's narrative director, Lodi's a fish out of water, but he's also the most qualified fish from that particular pond. So, as an actor, you come with your own set of experience and skills and perspective, and you can feel some level of confidence and comfort in that, and in the fact that you're here, that the artists creating this story saw something in you that seemed to fit, in their estimation, so you must be somehow "right," in some way, for the job. (That, or the other guy wasn't available.) But so, you were chosen for this purpose. You're "qualified," say. But also, this job is different, and enormous, and strange, and there's a lot riding on it. So, what do you do? You do what Lodi does. He's like the S-Tier fake-it-'til-you-make-it guy. And don't we all kind of do that? Or, not fake it. Trust it. More positive. Trust-it-'til-you-bust-it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the most interesting or compelling part of playing Lodi for you? What drew you to the role?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Well, everything, which isn't a good answer, but it's the honest one. Literally everything about this guy was interesting and compelling to me. We also share a somewhat uncanny amount of similarities on the page. We both love languages and people, we're both pacifists at heart, we both share a primary passion of communication and connection, we're both part Latino and speak Spanish but totally pass for a regular white dude, we're both peacemakers to a fault--I mean, it gets silly. I even loved ceviche before I went vegetarian. (I mean, I guess I still love it, technically.) We also kind of look alike.</p><p dir="ltr">One element of the character and story I will say I particularly enjoyed was that there was a fair amount of situational comedy that arose from being "guy from '60s cast into spacemagicfuture." There were some really, really fun beats to play with Lodi when he was getting fully discombobulated while trying to keep his cover and fit in with people who knows how many centuries past his frame of reference. He's like the ultimate, "How do you do, fellow kids?" guy, which, come to think of it, is another similarity we share. I kind of feel like I've been functionally 40 since I was 17. (Without, like, all the responsibility and knowing-about-stocks stuff.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were there any particular movies or performances that inspired you in bringing Lodi to life? Any other inspirations?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV: </strong>I got Kyle McLachlan/Dale Cooper tossed at me lightly, which made me squeal <em>very</em> audibly in the booth, because I'm a massive Lynch and Twin Peaks fan. And there was maybe, I think, a little mention of The X-Files. But honestly, it might sound boring, my North Star, so to speak, was the writing and Lodi himself. There were some <em>very</em> interesting and fun references made while discussing how to approach Lodi's other--let's say "personalities," to avoid spoilers?--but I'm honestly not sure I'm at liberty to discuss those. Heh. Man. That's why this character rules. I really got to do so, so much with him that I never ever saw coming.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you aware of the theory that Lodi assassinated JFK? Follow up: Did Lodi assassinate JFK? Have you got a different theory? We're okay with headcanon for this one.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Sorry, hold on. I think I'm getting a call. I probably need to answer this.</p>

                <p>Uber and Best Buy are teaming up to allow people across the US to order all manner of electronics--including video games--from the Uber Eats app.</p><p>This works in a pretty straightforward way: You find what you want from the Best Buy page on Uber Eats, and someone delivers it to you. To mark the launch, Uber is offering $20 off Best Buy orders of $60 or more using the code BESTBUY10. If you're an Uber One member, you get free delivery.</p><p>With the $20 off code, you could get Mario Kart World for $60 instead of $80, a new PS5 DualSense controller for $55, or an Xbox wireless controller for $45. You can <a href="https://about.ubereats.com/us/en/how-it-works/download-uber-eats-app/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">scroll through the app yourself</a> to see pricing and availability where you live. Best Buy does not appearing to be offering consoles like the Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, however, through the Uber Eats app.</p><p>Uber boss Hashim Amin said it's a consumer expectation today that they can see something online one minute and have it in their hands the next, and while the experience isn't that fast, same-day delivery for a much-wanted item is pretty nice.</p><p>"With this partnership, Uber Eats and Best Buy are making it easier than ever for customers to access the latest technology, whether it's a necessity or something fun. We're thrilled to help bring Best Buy's trusted assortment into the on-demand economy," Amin said.</p><p>Here are the official instructions for how it works, <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2025/Uber-Eats-and-Best-Buy-Team-Up-to-Deliver-Tech-and-Electronics-Nationwide/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">written by Uber</a>:</p><ol><li>Open the Uber Eats app and go to the "Retail" or "Electronics" category</li><li>Search for Best Buy and browse a wide selection of tech and home products</li><li>Add your items, choose a delivery time, and place your order</li><li>Track your delivery in real time</li></ol><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

By many accounts, bosses take seconds to plow through, mining gold is seemingly unlimited, and overall the game is "too easy." But the phrasing is somewhat reductive, not just in relation to Bananza, but when discussing difficulty in games as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The stigma of "too easy" might indicate that a game is hand-holdy, not trusting players to act or think for themselves. Or, it's boring and monotonous, lacking in mechanical complexity and resulting in little satisfaction from overcoming obstacles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Loosely characterizing Donkey Kong Bananza in this manner misses the point of what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Bananza is a breeze for players because it's built on a framework that is versatile and complex yet accessible and intuitive. By giving you all the tools you need to succeed in Bananza's vast sandbox, Nintendo made a game that feels effortless to punch your way through. If you think the game is easy, then it's doing its job correctly--Nintendo wants it to feel easy.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming that Donkey Kong Bananza isn't your first-ever video game, you're probably already well-versed and literate in gaming. With Bananza, Nintendo created a gaming "language" that players could pick up with little trouble. As you progress through the game, you learn how to string together basic control functions to execute creative movements. It's not unlike how Mario could use Cappy for platforming in Super Mario Odyssey, but DK has a lot more in his toolset.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is a game that requires creative solutions, and it prepares and trains the player well enough in this gameplay language so that these solutions come quickly. Often, Bananza has the answer to a problem right in front of the player, but the game doesn't give it away with a giant arrow (even though there are Fractones literally shaped like giant arrows that will direct you at critical story moments). Instead, the player must recall all of the challenges they've faced and the different contexts and cases in which they used the game's toolset to conjure up a solution.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Bananza often reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (and its sequel) in that problems can have multiple solutions, some that feel unintentional. The knowledge of the game's physics and how different materials interact with each other is lodged in your brain, and both Bananza and Breath of the Wild give you space to play around and solve puzzles in the way you want to. The shrines in Zelda and challenge rooms in Bananza are the best examples of these, acting as quizzes on how much knowledge about the games' systems you have retained and how to use them in different scenarios.</p><p dir="ltr">The open-world Zelda games and Bananza offer so many abilities and moves that forging your own path toward a solution almost feels like cheating. Think of every time where it felt like Bananza wanted you to take a certain route for a Banandium Gem, only for you to smash your own shortcut to it; or times when you should have gone through a platforming section, only to bypass most of it by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-transformations-in-donkey-kong-bananza-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6727/" data-ref-id="2900-6727">gliding as an ostrich</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean the game is broken--you're just smart enough to take that approach. And with the amount of testing that any video game goes through, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo undoubtedly knew that you could do that</a>, but Bananza is designed to make it feel like it was entirely your original idea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All this said, arguing against the simple labeling of "too easy" isn't to excuse Donkey Kong Bananza for any flaws or to shield it from all criticism. The boss fights are unmemorable encounters that negatively impact the game's pacing, and the abundance of gold essentially breaks the game's economy. There are imbalances in Bananza that warrant discussion. But condemning the game as "too easy" distracts us from the triumph and empowerment that we should feel as players.</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably silly to compare Donkey Kong Bananza to Dark Souls or Elden Ring, games that some players might find to be "too hard." The Souls games from From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki wear their difficulty on their sleeve. Even still, Nintendo and From Software have the same goal with their respective titles: making the player feel powerful.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122457/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Describing Demon's Souls back in 2009</a>, Miyazaki told Game Informer that making the game "difficult" was never the goal of the developers; instead, From Software wanted players to feel an "intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things." The Souls games approach this very differently from Nintendo titles--Souls games are famously unforgiving--but what they have in common is that they both provide players with tools to feel that sense of accomplishment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While something like Dark Souls might obviously be less approachable and more complex than Donkey Kong Bananza, it is still very much a game designed to be completed. Video games should make you feel successful, powerful, and smart, and the way Nintendo designed Bananza does just that.</p><p dir="ltr">Plus, like most modern Nintendo platformers, anyone seeking a higher level of challenge in Bananza can look forward to the post-game content. If you haven't played any of the Bananza Rehearsal levels, be warned that they can be infuriating. If you feel that the base game is missing some tension, those levels might provide it--and accomplishing them feels pretty darn good, or at least relieving.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll probably never abandon the vocabulary of "easy" and "hard" to describe games. Those words are, well, too easy to use in discussions. Still, with everything these games accomplish in empowering players, we should be able to critically discuss what makes a game feel easy or hard, rather than dismissing the entire experience with a single adjective.</p><p dir="ltr">I understand why someone playing Donkey Kong Bananza might call it too easy--but not only should we give developers the credit for crafting an approachable experience, we should acknowledge that we're pretty good at playing video games.</p>

                <p>It's the end of the road for two 2K Sports titles, at least for their online services. The publisher has announced that the servers for two aging golf games--The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour and PGA Tour 2K21--will go offline on October 30, 2025.</p><p>As of August 30, however, 2K Sports removed the ability to purchase any virtual currency for either game. Beyond that, however, the publisher said players "won't see any effect."</p><p>On October 30, 2K will close the servers for both titles, meaning each game's store, along with all online game modes and functionality--including progression rewards--will no longer be available.</p><p>2K Sports informed players of these changes in an email.</p><p>The publisher did not provide a reason for why the servers are going offline, but it's not uncommon for online servers for older games to close down over time. The games feature official PGA Tour licensed content, so expiring contracts could be a factor as well.</p><p>Released in 2018, The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour was the first game in the series to feature the PGA Tour branding. There was no entry in the series in 2019, but the franchise came back in 2020 as PGA Tour 2K21. PGA Tour 2K23 was released in 2022, followed by PGA Tour 2K25 in 2025.</p><p>PGA Tour 2K25 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 16 best-selling game for 2025 so far</a>. The series is developed by HB Studios, which Take-Two acquired in 2021.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p dir="ltr">There could be new content added to the Final Fantasy Tactics remake--and even a full-fledged sequel somewhere down the line--but that will require fans putting money where their mouths are with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. However, that's not a guarantee. </p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro discussed possibly adding features from 2007's Final Fantasy Chronicles: War of the Lions release on PlayStation Portable to the remake. “Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” said Maehiro. He acknowledged fan feedback for that content, such as the Onion Knight and Black Knight classes, but "cannot make any promises" about them coming eventually to The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Hands on Impressions</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remake will introduce a new difficulty option called Squire, which is aimed at helping newcomers to the spinoff series and genre. In addition, The Ivalice Chronicles does utilize the script from War of the Lions for the classic version included with the remake. As for a proper sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, that will depend on the game's reception and sales.</p><p dir="ltr">"If [The Ivalice Chronicles] were to become a success, I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs," said Maehiro, who served as events planner for the original Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. Earlier this year, the original's art director talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ff-tactics-original-art-director-wanted-to-make-it-under-one-unusual-condition/1100-6532552/">becoming obsessed with Final Fantasy Tactics running at 60fps</a> on PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/">The Final Fantasy Tactics remake was announced</a> at the PlayStation State of Play event in June. The RPG is set to launch September 30 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2. In fact, there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chonicles-preorder-amazon-exclusive-edition-switch-2-playstation/1100-6532119/">a free Switch 2 upgrade for The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, though no physical edition for the new hybrid console.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
