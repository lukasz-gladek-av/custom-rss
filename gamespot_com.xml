                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part II</a> debuted in 2020, it did so after a few major plot points were spoiled online well in advance. Now, with the show set to adapt that story when The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO in a few weeks, there's a risk a whole new audience will have their experience altered by the prevalence of spoilers online. But for showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the latter of whom is now living through this predicament for a second time, spoilers aren't a huge concern.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel like the best way I could respect the audience is by not thinking about them too much when I'm working on whatever I'm writing. That way I could just make the best decision with as little outside influence as possible, and make the best internal decisions for the characters, for the story, for the medium," Druckmann told GameSpot. "And you know, when it comes to like, what are we going to spoil or not spoil? You know, I fought tooth-and-nail when we made the game, and that all blew up in my face at the end, when we had those leaks that happened like months before the game came out. So I've learned to not put so much stock in that. But also, now I have a creative partner, HBO. I kind of follow their lead here as far as spoilers and what we should show and not show and just, you know, again, approach it as if we're doing it for the first time, assuming the audience doesn't know anything. They're not Googling what happened in the game or not."</p><p dir="ltr">Even with spoilers floating around for those who can't resist looking for them, the second season, like the first season, changes some details in order to ensure the team is "making the best choices for this moment in time," as a TV audience has different needs than a video game player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1584" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on April 13 on HBO and Max.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But also, again, my approach with the show is, I assume you know nothing," he continued. "I assume you haven't played the game. I guess there's some assumption you've watched the first season, but even that, we're not 100% sure, so HBO created this beautiful recap of Season 1."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked the pair if the production team created any content meant as spoiler disinformation, like when creators for Lost or Game of Thrones would film scenes they had no plans to use just to fill the spoiler forums with disorienting noise--a practice that horrifies Mazin.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is, it's really hard to make the show. We use every second of every day to make the stuff we want to make," he said. "The thought of spending time shooting stuff we don't want to make is sort of a horrifying prospect to me. And I think Neil's right. The thing about spoiler stuff is it's kind of overrated; the impact that it has is overrated. And you can look at that just empirically with The Last of Us Part II, which had the leaks. There was all this spoiler outrage, and then the games sold gazillions of copies and won every award you can win, and it was beautiful. It didn't matter the spoiler. Like, I always use the example of Titanic, although, honestly, I could use Chernobyl, too. 'Hey, here's a spoiler. It blew up, right?' [The] Titanic sinks, and we all still went to the theater to watch it because we don't care about that. We care about the relationships."</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO and Max beginning on April 13 and will run for seven episodes on a weekly release schedule. The season won't cover all of The Last of Us Part II's story, and a third season is planned, though not yet officially announced.</p>

However, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/">official website</a> explaining the concept makes an interesting reference in the fine print that may shed light on how the company will define "enhanced" Switch 1 games going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Hidden among the asterisks on the bottom of the page, the website refers to a heretofore unannounced term called "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" games. Specifically, the site reads "Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> [emphasis added] can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The capitalization of "Edition" in that phrase is what's interesting--while Nintendo has mentioned that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backward-compatible</a> with select Switch 1 games, the company hasn't elaborated further on how that will work. This new phrase, and the way it's presented on this official Nintendo website, implies that it is an official term to distinguish between Switch 2-only games and Switch 2 versions of other games. Switch 2 Edition games could refer to enhanced versions of Switch games, though whether such a thing will exist or if there will be any upgrade cost remains unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been multiple rumors of games that have previously launched on the current Nintendo Switch receiving some sort of enhancement on the upcoming successor. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been mentioned among the likely candidates, while the recent Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster was found to be hiding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-editions-hidden-mode-could-hint-at-switch-2-feature/1100-6530249/">secret 60 frames-per-second mode</a> within its code.</p><p dir="ltr">Virtual Game Cards were one of many announcements during the most recent Nintendo Direct, which also included the debut announcements of new games in Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rhythm-heaven-is-coming-to-switch-but-not-until-2026/1100-6530421/">Rhythm Heaven</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-2026/1100-6530426/">Tomodachi Life</a> franchises. The Direct also provided updates on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not directly mentioned "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" games as of this writing, but that may change during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct livestream slated for April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced a major change</a> to its organization as it looks to the future, as the company has created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent is investing €1.16 billion ($1.25 billion USD) to take a minority stake (about 25%) in this new subsidiary.</p><p>Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel. However, it's unknown to what extent these changes could result in potential layoffs or studio closures.</p><p>"This new subsidiary will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform. Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>Alongside the announcement of this new business entity, Ubisoft said it will "focus on nurturing" some of its other franchises, including Ghost Recon and The Division, while also continuing to make new IP and building out its game engine technologies and online services. Ubisoft said it will share more information "at a later stage."</p><p>Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said this marks a "new chapter" in Ubisoft's history, calling this a "foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model."</p><p>"With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises' long-term growth and success," Guillemot said.</p><p>Tencent president Martin Lau said, "We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</p><p>In terms of further specifics, the new subsidiary includes the development teams working on Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Ubisoft said it also includes any new games in those places under development currently or that are made in the future, along with back catalog titles from those teams. This new subsidiary is getting rights to the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises in exchange for an unspecified royalty payment.</p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p><p>Ubisoft's latest big release was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which debuted on March 20, quickly reaching 3 million players and collecting strong reviews from critics.</p>
