                <p>In the realm of Warhammer 40k, players have faced formidable enemies for years. But Warhammer publisher Games Workshop has run into an unlikely foe that it has yet to defeat. According the company's latest financial disclosure, Games Workshop's plan for a new car park have apparently been derailed by a "cute looking" bat</p><p>As spotted by IGN, Games Workshop <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/6RTEwwgirDZoH36H2AfQ8f/41dd13da3aad11bb599a6c2ad9df8f2b/2024-25_Press_statement_29_Jul.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has shared its latest financial report</a> for investors, and notes that a "cute looking pipistrelle bat is delaying our work on our new temporary car park," before adding that the company is "carefully looking after the bat."</p><p>The report notes that Games Workshop amassed huge profits for its fiscal year ending in June 2025. However, President Trump's tariffs are a larger concern going forward for the company's lucrative physical goods business.</p><p>"We hope the uncertainty around tariffs is resolved soon," notes the company in the report. "We are also mindful of the increased risk of supply chain disruption as a direct consequence of conflicts around the world, which we highlight as a principal risk... This new problem will be dealt with in our normal pragmatic way. We will not change our operational plans too much... It's mostly out of our control."</p><p>Games Workshop also acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">a deal with Amazon for the Warhammer 40k adaptation rights</a> has been finalized, with some creative issues still to worked out for any film and television projects. However, they may be years away from arriving on Prime Video. Henry Cavill <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-reportedly-attached-to-warhammer-40k-series-for-amazon/1100-6510114/" data-ref-id="1100-6510114">is slated to produce and potentially star in the Warhammer 40k TV show</a>.</p>

                <p>After ordering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">massive layoffs across the company</a> earlier this month, Microsoft shared its report for investors at the end of its fiscal year. One of the bright spots for Microsoft was Xbox Game Pass, which had nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time.</p><p>The complete transcript of <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/Document/DownloadDocument/65/TranscriptQandAFY25q4.docx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's investor report</a> is online, but it doesn't break down the specifics of Game Pass' milestone in terms of subscribers or even the specific revenue amount that it reached. Last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">announced price hikes for Game Pass</a> and introduced Xbox Game Pass Standard, which doesn't include day one access for the company's biggest games. That perk is reserved for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">the best-selling PlayStation games in the second quarter of 2025</a> in the US, Microsoft noted that it was "the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter," before crediting the cross-platform launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered for achieving that feat. Other Microsoft titles including Doom: The Dark Ages, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Minecraft also appeared as best-sellers on PlayStation's Q2 chart.</p><p>Microsoft went on to state that Black Ops 6 has drawn 50 million players to date, and added that the Minecraft movie led to record active usage and revenue for the already wildly successful game.</p><p>The report doesn't really dwell on the recent layoffs or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">canceled gaming projects like Rare's Everwild</a>. But it does state that Microsoft still has "nearly 40 games in development." GameSpot recently assembled a list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/upcoming-xbox-games/2900-6759/" data-ref-id="2900-6759">Xbox games that are still believed to be in the works</a>.</p>
