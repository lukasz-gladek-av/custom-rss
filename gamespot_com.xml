                <p>A new study has revealed its findings on the carbon footprint of physical video games, and unsurprisingly, digitally downloaded games are considered to be more environmentally friendly in comparison to physical. French carbon-accounting firm Greenly studied the environmental impact of various systems and the production of video games, finding that physical copies of games are "100 times more carbon-intensive" than their digital counterparts.</p><p>According to Greenly, the manufacturing and transportation of physical games--with 1 million discs being used as an example--could produce 312 tons of carbon dioxide, while 1 million downloads of the same game--if it were 70GB in size--would equal three tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>"Although cloud-based gaming can be detrimental as a result of its need for continuous access to energy-hungry data servers, we also cannot neglect the continued impact of manufacturing and packaging physical video games," study author Stephanie Safdie explained to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/manufacture-and-shipping-of-physical-games-is-100-times-more-carbon-intensive-than-digital-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Ultimately, downloading a digital copy imposes emissions linked to electricity use at home, as well as the energy use of the concerned data center--but it does not have the same impact as the emissions created by the industry in terms of landfill and excessive waste, which are primarily still accounted for by physical consoles and hard disc copies of games."</p><p>Ultimately, the production of a physical game disc involves the extraction of rare earth metals and the production of plastic, which in turn requires the usage of machines, processes, and labor that contribute to the drain on resources. This includes the manufacturing of consoles, with Greenly estimating that these devices consume 3.9 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year in the US and are responsible for the production of 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent). Factor in television sets also running on electricity, and the ultimate impact of gaming across traditional consoles, mobile devices, and cloud gaming is significant.</p><p>So what's an environmentally conscious gamer supposed to do? Greenly found that handheld systems produce far fewer emissions--13.8kg CO2e per year with the Switch, for example--and the firm also suggested that companies look at methods to reduce their overall energy consumption.</p><p>This has been an area where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-energy-saving-graphics-modes-reportedly-being-explored-by-microsoft/1100-6508943/">Microsoft has been heavily focused</a> with its use of recycled materials and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-consoles-can-now-download-updates-in-energy-saver-mode/1100-6501492/">energy-saving power modes</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has confirmed that in the last two quarters, it has sold a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">staggering number of Switch 2 consoles</a>. As part of its latest financial results, the company reported 10.36 million Switch 2 units sold as of September 30, in the two quarters since it went on sale. In the last three months alone, Nintendo sold 4.54 million Switch 2 consoles.</p><p>To put that into context, that's more than double what the original Switch console sold within the same two-month time period (4.7 million units sold), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-year-1-sales-compared-ahead-of-wii-u-behind-ps4-and-more/1100-6500218/">and even more than what Sony managed with the PS4</a> (7.5 million units sold) and PS5 (7.8 million units sold) during its first two quarters. With the Switch 2 selling well, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo has now increased its hardware forecast</a> for the business year, as it predicts that it'll sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">up from its original estimate of 15 million</a>. If Nintendo reaches this number, that'll put Switch 2 sales far ahead of the original Switch, PS4, and PS5 consoles during their launch years.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As for its predecessor, the Switch has now reached 154.01 million units sold since 2017. This puts the Switch within spitting distance of the Nintendo DS, which sold 154.02 million units. Nintendo noted a 60% decline in Switch sales when compared to the same period in its previous fiscal year, but it is predicting that the console will dethrone the Nintendo DS by the end of its financial year and will cement itself as the company's best-selling console of all time.</p><p>In the games department, Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World has reached 9.57 million lifetime sales to date, and it is selling far better than its predecessor, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The game has a 92% attach rate, and around 8.1 million of these sales were from the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included the game. Donkey Kong Bananza has reached an impressive 3.49 million units sold since it launched in July, and the Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree has hit 1.16 million units sold.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has a strong lineup for the holiday season. This month will see the launch of Kirby Air Riders and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, while December will see the highly anticipated release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p>
