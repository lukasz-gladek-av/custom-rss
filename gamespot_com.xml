                <p>During its developer livestream on March 4, Bungie announced a brand-new, limited-time PvP mode called Heavy Metal coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>in Heresy Act 3.</p><p>While details were limited, we did get to see some gameplay that shows teams of players sorted into Drake Tank drivers or Brig pilots. Guardians haven't been able to control Brigs before, despite them being in the game for more than half a decade. While we've had access to Drake Tanks before, they now have new functionality including rocket-boosted backflips.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453912"></a><figcaption>Heavy Metal is a 6v6 vehicle combat mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg"></figure><p>The 6v6 vehicle combat activity is only going to be in the game for a limited time. Bungie hinted that, if the reception is positive, Heavy Metal could be added to the Crucible rotation, much like the chaotic Mayhem mode, which features near-zero ability cooldowns.</p><p>Bungie wants players to find the mode "goofy and fun" and challenged Guardians to jump in a Drake Tank to perform a 360 no-scope.</p><p>There's no official release date for the Heavy Metal PvP mode, but it has been confirmed to be releasing at some point within Heresy Act 3, which releases on April 1.</p><p>Other announcements during the livestream include the arrival of a limited-time dungeon-focused event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-rite-of-the-nine-event-is-for-dungeon-newcomers-and-veterans-alike/1100-6529863/" data-ref-id="1100-6529863">Rite of the Nine</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-io-planet-is-coming-out-of-the-vault-next-week-for-a-new-roguelike-inspired-activity/1100-6529860/" data-ref-id="1100-6529860"> return of Io</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie has announced the upcoming arrival of Rite of the Nine, a limited-time Destiny 2 event centered around three of the space shooter's dungeons.</p><p>The dungeons featured will be Prophecy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-spire-of-the-watcher-dungeon-guide/1100-6509966/" data-ref-id="1100-6509966">Spire of the Watcher</a>, and Ghosts of the Deep. They'll rotate weekly throughout the event's duration. Three modes - Ultimatum, Explorer, and Eternity, will affect the way players experience each dungeon. Players will be working towards a high score, and that score is calculated on how often you die. Stay alive as much as possible, and your score will be higher. That score will determine how good the loot drop is at the completion of each encounter. "We're challenging you to go into this harder mode and not just execute, but execute in a way that gets you a higher score, better rolls, and in the Ultimatum mode, Adept versions," Bungie explained.</p><p>Ultimatum mode is for players who are experienced in running dungeons looking for an extra challenge. Ultimatum mode will bump the power level to be equivalent with the game's most difficult content as seen in the likes of Contest mode. Each dungeon will have activity modifiers added which will craft the experience, or make it more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453899" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453899"></a><figcaption>Rite of the Nine entrance</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Bungie's aim here is to require Guardians to make decisions before entering a dungeon or starting an encounter. For example, the Not Swap mod means you'll need to keep one Exotic equipped for the duration of the encounter without changing it. "We need you to really focus on figuring out this encounter and how you're going to tackle the challenges associated with it," Bungie said.</p><p>Explorer mode has been created for players who may not have ever played a dungeon before. They'll be tuned so that Guardians can go in, learn the mechanics, and gain experience. It gives players the opportunity to take their time and figure it out. To accommodate this, Bungie has added in-world tooltips that describe the dungeon mechanics, as well as markers for the moments where a route might be less obvious. Alongside this, there will be reduced Darkness phases, and the revive timer will be just five seconds long. Bungie wants to remove the penalty for failure and encourage players to learn these dungeons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453900"></a><figcaption>Adept weapons in Rite of the Nine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png"></figure><p>In the event's launch space, Guardians will meet the Emissary, who serves as the event vendor. The Emissary will offer quests, bounties, and rewards throughout the event. Four weapons from each dungeon can be earned. These weapons have reworked perk pools, as well as new perks. Similarly to the Into the Light event, Guardians can attune themselves to specific weapons if they're looking for a particular roll.</p><p>Ultimatum mode is the only mode which will drop Adept versions of the dungeons' weapons, which have new treatment. Not only do Adept weapons roll with additional perks, but they have a visual makeover too. An animated holofoil pattern shines across the weapons, and Nine iconography is engraved into them.</p><p>As well as the Adept weapons, a new event-exclusive Origin Perk called Gravity Well will drop on all weapons during the event. While Bungie didn't tell us exactly what Gravity Well does, it did disclose that players will only be able to get weapons with this Origin Perk during the Rite of the Nine event.</p>

Along with the usual four face buttons on the right side of the control, you’ll find two additional face buttons as R1 and R2. All six face buttons utilize microswitches, which Hori states were used to increase the accuracy and durability of the inputs.</p><p>Even with R1 and R2 moving to the front of the controller, the Octa Pro still has four tactile shoulder buttons. You can also map inputs to the pair of remappable back buttons.</p><p>The 8-gate analog stick was designed with fighting games in mind, so diagonal inputs should be easier to execute on the Octa Pro compared to a standard controller. Inside the box, you'll find three hot-swappable D-pad designs. Hori also added a low-profile "analog slide pad" that resembles the Switch's Circle Pad. The slide pad is meant to be used in menu systems.</p><p>The controller is wireless, though it does include a USB-C cable for charging and wired play. It comes with a cable lock to mitigate the risk of a disconnection during a match. Hori says the the controller can run for roughly 10 hours between charges. In addition to the USB-C port, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You’ll find a cable lock feature on the back of the gamepad--so you can lock the cable in place to ensure it doesn’t disconnect during the heat of battle. Expect to get around 10 hours of game time per charge. While the Octa Pro is technically compatible with PS4, it can only be used in wired mode on PlayStation's last-gen console.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, a more affordable variation of the controller is already available--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-PlayStation-Fighting-Commander-OCTA-5/dp/B09RQTTWPQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Commander Octa</a>.

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched in February to critical acclaim and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">more than 2 million in sales</a>, but the game debuted with no ability to give your character, Henry, a look of your own choosing. That's set to change soon, as developer Warhorse has announced that Barber Mode is coming to the RPG in mid-March, and it'll allow players to change their hair and beard style. This mode was first announced in January when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Warhorse revealed the game's post-launch content roadmap.</a></p><p>This was announced as part of a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2392565307" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch livestream</a>, during which Warhorse showed off the new beard and hair styles. Reddit user Valmont_DE captured some images from the stream, which show off how players will be able to customize Henry's look when the update arrives.</p><p>As you can see, the Barber mode will allow players to customize Henry's hair and facial hair, and there are plenty of options to choose from to help make him look how you want.</p><p>The developer livestream also dug into new details around Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Hardcore mode</a>, which Warhorse said is a "more difficult and immersive way" of playing the RPG, <a href="https://gamerant.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hair-beard-styles-revealed-barber-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant reported</a>. In Hardcore mode, some helpful UI elements will be limited in and out of combat, while your player's location is never shown on the map, so you have to find a way on your own. Additionally, fast travel is disabled, and players can choose "negative perks" to make the game harder.</p><p>Following these free updates, Warhorse will release new story expansions for Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance through the game's paid expansion pass. These story expansions include Brushes with Death in Summer 2025 and Legacy of the Forge in Fall 2025. A third expansion, Mysteria Ecclesia, is set for release in Winter 2025.</p>
