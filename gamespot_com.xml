                <p>Concord barely lasted two weeks before Sony pulled the plug on it, and it seems determined to keep the game offline as it just issued DMCA notices against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-lives-again-as-fan-made-project-unveils-gameplay-test-videos/1100-6536235/">fan-made effort to revive the live-service shooter as Concord Delta</a>. Recently, several Concord fans had managed to resurrect the game with some technical wizardry, and although the project was in a buggy WIP state, it was still a playable build on a custom server.</p><p>The team of developers responsible for reviving Concord did take measures to protect themselves and kept the player circle small, but copyright infringement claims against videos filed by Marscan--a company that monitors online content for large clients such as Sony and has issued DMCA notices to multiple creators in the past for content like the Bloodborne demake--has the group fearing that legal repercussions might be on the way.</p><p>"Due to worrying legal action we've decided to pause invites for the time being," one of the devs behind the project said in the team's Discord group (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" rel="nofollow ">The Games Post</a>). So far, the custom server for Concord Delta has not yet been targeted by Sony--only footage of it in action on YouTube or other social media platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/">Concord had a disastrous launch in 2024</a>, leading to the closure of its developer Firewalk Studios. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/">Sony still remains committed to live-service games</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-talks-concord-failure-and-the-hard-lessons-learned-from-it/1100-6527647/">and says that it has learned a few lessons along the way</a> after it fully refunded everyone who bought Concord--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-government-cites-concord-during-debate-about-consumer-protections-for-gamers/1100-6535897/">the game was cited as an example</a> by the United Kingdom's House of Commons about the importance of video game preservation.</p>

                <p>The Entertainment Software Association has released the results of its annual holiday shopping survey, and the data shows that kids really want video games, but not as much as they want cash.</p><p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The ESA's survey found</a> that video games are among the top three things that kids want this holiday, with 58% of kids saying they would like games as gifts this year. Money and gift cards (69%) was the most sought-after gift for kids, followed by clothes/accessories (63%), and then video games at 58%.</p><p>The survey also found that 58% of kids want to play more video games with their parents; the percentage increases to 73% for kids ages 5-7, 66% for ages 8-9, and 62% for ages 10-12.</p><p>The ESA's survey also found that the most likely generation to ask for video games as gifts this holiday was Gen Alpha (ages 5-12), at 62%. Beyond games themselves, kids also want in-game currency (43%), some kind of gaming console (39%), physical games (37%), video game accessories (37%), or a video game subscription (32%).</p><p>Finally, the ESA survey found that, among parents who said they are planning to buy their children video games as gifts this year, they plan to spend an average of $736.83. That figure may look high, but games are generally more and more expensive these days, and consoles are ticking up in price, too, due in part to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>"Our research this year shows that kids not only want games, they also want quality time with their families. In a world where people feel increasingly disconnected, playing video games remains one of the easiest--and most fun--ways to stay close to the people we love," ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis said in a statement.</p><p>This survey was conducted by YouGov and the ESA via a five-minute online survey from September 26-30 this year. More than 1,900 people aged 5-65 took part in the study, the data for which was "weighted to be representative of the overall US population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, education and census region."</p>

                <p>Valve is making a play for living rooms again with its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">Steam Machine hardware</a>, and the company believes that the compact gaming PC could be equal to or better than what "70%" of people have at home currently. In a new interview, Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat explained that the Steam Machine is designed to be both a powerful and entry-level gaming device, capable of running most of the games in your Steam library at high performance levels.</p><p>"As you know, we definitely learned a lot, from 10 years ago. We learned a lot from the Steam Deck. We really feel like we have all the hardware and the software bits to make that vision a reality," Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://youtu.be/VkW3wTHT-p8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tested</a>. "It needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games; we wanted it to be a pretty simple experience. We also wanted to target more of an entry-level device. Affordability is really important, and definitely the price-point played a huge factor in what performance level we're trying to target. Another thing we looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. It gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkW3wTHT-p8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aldehayyat's comments might not be too far off the mark. Older gaming PCs are still capable of running a wide variety of games thanks to upscaling technologies, while in the console space, many games are still released for both current and last-gen machines, like the PS4 and the Switch. Valve has also said that the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and the official tech specs released for it do suggest that it'll be capable of comfortably playing modern PC games.</p><p>The biggest question so far about the Steam Deck isn't <em>how </em>it'll perform, but what it'll cost when it launches next year. Aldehayyat has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">Valve wants to sell Steam Machine units at a "competitive" price</a>, with analysts predicting that it could cost $400 in a best-case scenario or as much as $1,000 if Valve is aiming to break even on every sale or make a slim profit. This is the second time that Valve is launching a Steam Machine, but Valve says it's determined to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/">not repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>

                <p>Retailer GameStop has announced a "Trade Anything Day," and as part of this, people can visit a store and trade anything. Well, not quite anything. There is a list of items that GameStop will not accept, including dead animals and illegal drugs.</p><p>The fine print for the December 6 event states that people can only bring in for trade items that fit into GameStop's own 20x20x20 box and that employees have discretion to reject any item.</p><p>In terms of the specific exclusions, GameStop said people cannot bring hazardous waste, weapons, dead or alive animals (taxidermy is OK, though), alcohol, tobacco, drugs (illegal or otherwise), "sexual and explicit" items, or items "resembling body parts." The full list of exclusions is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop+%22Trade+Anything+Day%22+Is+Coming+Up+Soon%2C+Doesn%27t+Accept+%28Most%29+Dead+Animals+Or+Illegal+Drugs&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-11-17+05%3A04%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-17+06%3A31%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6536265&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.gamestop.com%252Ftrade%252F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestop-trade-anything-day-is-coming-up-soon-doesnt-accept-most-dead-animals-or-illegal-drugs%2F1100-6536265%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on GameStop's website.</a></p><p>It is unclear how GameStop will determine trade-in values for some of the odd items people may choose to bring on the day. But in any event, people should know this is a marketing campaign first and foremost that is meant to bring people to GameStop's stores to drive sales and awareness.</p><p>In other news, GameStop is among the numerous retailers that is not raising Xbox Game Pass prices, so you can still buy one month of Game Pass Ultimate for $20 there. GameStop specifically has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">pledged that it will not raise prices, at least not yet.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop+%22Trade+Anything+Day%22+Is+Coming+Up+Soon%2C+Doesn%27t+Accept+%28Most%29+Dead+Animals+Or+Illegal+Drugs&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-11-17+05%3A04%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-17+06%3A31%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6536265&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fdeals&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestop-trade-anything-day-is-coming-up-soon-doesnt-accept-most-dead-animals-or-illegal-drugs%2F1100-6536265%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop's early Black Friday sale is live now</a>, offering a range of nice discounts on a variety of games, accessories, and other products.</p>
