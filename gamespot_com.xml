                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch has released its first post-launch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant," Scronce says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8JKDfXT1pg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8JKDfXT1pg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The developer is also aware of the community debate around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/">Black Ops 7's aim assist</a>, which features reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. "We have been closely monitoring that conversation and looking at our internal data," Scronce says. The developer also reveals the studio is "fairly happy" with where the game's aim-assist is at, but there will be a slight increase to aim-assist strength at range. This change will arrive sometime ahead of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch's planned update includes spawn adjustments for Hardpoint, Free-For-All, and Team Deathmatch modes. A nerf is also coming for the game's overpowered Drone Pod field upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer announced that Endgame mode, which players can unlock after completing the campaign, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">available to everyone</a> starting on November 21. Players who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a variety of rewards, including XP tokens, GobbleGums, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies changes, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discusses the difficulty level of the boss fight for Ashes of the Damned. The developer says it was designed to be challenging, but it is more difficult than intended. Adjustments will be made to the barnacle spawns needed to help Ol' Tessie, so players can spend less time repairing the Wonder Vehicle and more time driving. The developer says it's slowing down the speed boss's missile barrage attack.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/">Nuketown arrived to Black Ops 7 today</a>, and this is a new 2025 variant of Treyarch's classic map. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional maps, and more.</p>

                <p>You'll need to take a trip to the Spaceport map to complete the A Lay of the Land quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. This quest tasks you with finding multiple items in a single trip to the map, so you'll want to come prepared to make a long trek and survive for quite some time. Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.</p><p>Knowing that you'll have a lot of traveling and surviving to do on Spaceport for the A Lay of the Land quest, we'd recommend you bring guns you're comfortable with, as well as plenty of healing items. Additionally, it's a great idea to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with a specific item to complete the quest back in Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to head out and begin A Lay of the Land, follow the guide below.</p><h2>Where to find the shipping notes in the foreman's office</h2><p>The first objective requires you to collect some shipping notes in the foreman's office at the Jiangsu Warehouse. This POI is located on the northwestern side of the Spaceport map. It's not usually a very busy spot, but keep your eyes open for nearby raiders nonetheless.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895" data-ratio="0.56039807824296" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895"></a><figcaption>Jiangsu Warehouse location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg"></figure><p>Once inside, you'll notice there's really not much to this warehouse. Simply head upstairs into the office to locate the shipping notes on a desk in plain sight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606897" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606897"></a><figcaption>Look for the shipping notes on a desk upstairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg"></figure><p>With that out of the way, you'll have a slightly more dangerous location to head to next, so get prepared and set off when you're ready.</p><h2>Locate the scanners on the upper floor of Control Tower A6</h2><p>The second objective requires you to seek out a LiDAR Scanner on the upper floor of Control Tower A6, which is located in the middle of the Spaceport map. This area is among the most contested locations on the map, meaning you'll want to approach it with the mindset that a fight could break out at any moment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606886" data-ratio="0.56047092400999" data-width="2803" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606886"></a><figcaption>Control Tower A6 location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg"></figure><p>There are a few ways to enter the first room of the Control Tower A6, but for the sake of this guide, we need to enter from the front left side.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606887" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606887"></a><figcaption>Enter Control Tower A6 here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you enter the Control Tower A6 building, walk to the door straight ahead.

As such, you'll want to head to whichever extraction point is closest to your location and play things cautiously until you can get out. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure the LiDAR Scanner is placed in it in case you don't make it out. It's not that we don't believe in you; we're just looking out for you, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

What is Roadside Research? Few things in life are certain, but I feel confident in saying you probably won't guess the hook for this game.</p><h2><strong>What even is Roadside Research?</strong></h2><p>Roadside Research is a 1-4 player co-op gas station simulator. Simulator-type games are everywhere these days, but this one differentiates itself because you play as an alien. More specifically, you're an undercover alien who tries to act like a human and do human-like things that a gas station attendant would do like stocking shelves and assisting customers. "Just don't get caught," reads a line from the description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Roadside Research | Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy3A4oxvKKg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yy3A4oxvKKg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All the while, players are trying to gather intelligence on humans in preparation for an upcoming alien invasion. "If you arouse too much suspicion, the government will show up, jeopardizing your Earthly mission," the description adds.</p><p>This is a comedic game, as you can immediately tell by watching the trailer. The aliens in the game are the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">little green men</a>, and to blend in, you must create what you deem to be a human-looking face mask--but it doesn't have to be any good, really.</p><p>Game Pass gets a lot of big-name launches, and one of the perks of a subscription service is that you can sample titles you might not otherwise rush to buy outright. If you're curious about Roadside Research but not sure you want to buy it, Game Pass seems like a pretty good avenue.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4607998-screenshot2025-11-20at1.56.46%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607998" data-ratio="0.54785894206549" data-width="1588" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4607998-screenshot2025-11-20at1.56.46%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607998"></a><figcaption>Nailed it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4607998-screenshot2025-11-20at1.56.46%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>During the daytime, players will work as gas station attendants and do their best to blend in and be "normal." At night, players will take what they learned about humans and use that information to upgrade the gas station to attract more humans, and thereby gather even more intelligence about them.</p><p>Roadside Research is set for release in Q1 2026 (January 1-March 31, 2026) and will come to Game Pass Ultimate at launch for Xbox and PC. It's not immediately clear if the game is also coming to PlayStation.</p><p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3643170/Roadside_Research/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo is available already on Steam</a>. It's attracted a lot of interest and attention on Steam, where it's landed on more than 300,000 user wishlists, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3643170/view/514096230384533700?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 260,000 people playing the demo</a> as of early October.</p><h2><strong>What else has Cybernetic Walrus made?</strong></h2><p>Cybernetic Walrus is an independent developer that aims to "redefine how players connect with virtual worlds," and <a href="https://www.cyberneticwalrus.com/about-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">specifically mentions on its website </a>that it makes simulation-type games. Before Roadside Research, the studio made the horror game Order 13, in which players must navigate a dark and scary warehouse as they take on packing orders and try to keep their cat alive. The team also made Does It Stack, a physics-based mixed-reality puzzle game for Meta Quest VR. Additionally, Cybernetic Walrus developed the futuristic anti-gravity racing game Antigravitator.</p><h2><strong>You don't have to pay extra for Game Pass... for now</strong></h2><p>In October, Microsoft announced a dramatic Xbox Game Pass price increase for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, along with some changes to the other tiers. The new price for Game Pass Ultimate soared by 50% to $30/month. However, most major retailers are not going with the new price, at least not yet, so <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">you can still get Game Pass Ultimate for $20/month or $60 for three months on Amazon</a> and many other stores.</p>
