And while MGM has been very protective of Bond, there was only one specific request made by the studio during production of the game.</p><p>IO Interactive franchise director Jonathan Lacaille recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that aside from a request, "Don't make him a killing machine,'" the studio has been very open to IO Interactive's new take on Bond.</p><p>"They've considered every idea we've had," recalled Lacaille. "There weren't many massive nos or anything like that. It was always more like, 'Yeah, but, we could do it this way, or…' So it's always been very collaborative, and a lot of good feedback, because they've been working with the franchise for so long as well, so it was great to have them so involved in the project, right? I'm sure it was a fun ride for them as well.'</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has previously hinted that 007 First Light may incorporate a live-service element from the Hitman games by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-may-have-hitman-like-live-service-missions/1100-6532678/" data-ref-id="1100-6532678">dropping new missions for Bond</a> during the game's post-launch period.</p><p>Hitman: World of Assassination recently had an example of what that may look like when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. In that Elusive Target mission, Hitman's Agent 47 gets to decide how he wants to eliminate LeChiffre while still managing to escape with his life.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous take on Bond and it features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

                <p>The Analogue 3D has been delayed once again, and it will now be shipping out in late August. Analogue says that recent tariff changes in the US are to blame, but the company is prepared to cover these extra costs and will not pass them on to consumers who preordered the $250 retro-game console.</p><p>"Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month. We're absorbing the costs--your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges," <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue-3d-shipping-next-month" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analogue said</a> in a statement on its website.</p><p>Several East-Asian countries are facing steep tariffs following US President Donald Trump's announcement on July 7. These range from 25% to 40%, with these import taxes being charged on goods as they enter the US and paid for by American consumers and businesses.</p><p>The Analogue 3D was announced last year, and preorders for it sold out extremely quickly. Analogue originally aimed for a Q1 2025 release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogues-4k-nintendo-64-delayed-to-july-8bitdo-64-controllers-still-available/1100-6527188/" data-ref-id="1100-6527188">but it was later delayed to July</a>. The console is an FPGA device designed to provide an authentic N64 gameplay experience, but with the added benefit of a 4K resolution on modern displays. What also makes it appealing for retro-game enthusiasts is that it supports all of the original N64 accessories, but you can use modern peripherals like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller</a> on it.</p><p>You can also cycle through various display modes made to reproduce the look of an old-school television set on the Analogue 3D, with faithfully reproduced scanlines and shadow mask effects that can recreate the CRT TV experience. Analogue said that it spent over four years developing a perfect way to experience N64 in FPGA for absolute accuracy, and ideally, this should be a massive step up when compared to an N64 emulator.</p>

                <p>HBO's The Last of Us recently lost Neil Druckmann as a director and co-showrunner, but a top boss at the company is not worried about his departure from the popular series. HBO content chairman Casey Bloys commented on Druckmann's departure and revealed a 2027 window for Season 3 in a new interview.</p><p>He told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that it was "great to have Neil involved in the beginning." Druckmann helped provide a "blueprint" for where the TV series is headed. That, combined with how the show's other top boss, Craig Mazin, is staying on, helps Bloys have faith the show will be fine.</p><p>"So I think we'll be in excellent shape. I'm not worried at all," he said.</p><p>Bloys also said it's important to remember that Druckmann was working on The Last of Us TV show at the same time as managing his full-time responsibilities at Naughty Dog.</p><p>"It's a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that," Bloys said.</p><p>Druckmann <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">announced his departure from the TV series earlier this month</a>, saying he was stepping back to focus on writing and directing Naughty Dog's new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann is Studio Head and Head of Creative at Naughty Dog and is spending more time focused on those roles now that he's left the TV series.</p><h2>Season 3 is "Definitely planned for 2027"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Bloys revealed that The Last of Us Season 3 is "definitely planned for 2027." He also clarified that Mazin is still working out how to end The Last of Us.</p><p>"Craig is still working it out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season. It hasn't been decided yet, and I'm following Craig's lead on that," Bloys said.</p><p>Previously, Mazin had said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">a fourth season would be essential to closing things out properly.</a> "There's no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth," Mazin said.</p><p>Finally, Bloys addressed the fact that Pedro Pascal's character, Joel, has been killed off, and that the next episodes are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-is-all-about-abby/1100-6531704/" data-ref-id="1100-6531704">expected to focus on Kaitlyn Dever's Abby</a> as opposed to Bella Ramsey's Ellie. Does that present a challenge in marketing and promoting the series? Bloys doesn't think so.</p><p>"I think the title is obviously helped by the video game, and now the first two seasons is pretty well established. I kind of appreciate shows that take things and do a show from a different point of view," he said.</p><p>The Last of Us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-reacts-to-the-last-of-us-picking-up-16-emmy-nominations/1100-6533179/" data-ref-id="1100-6533179">picked up 16 Emmy nominations this week</a>, including a nod for Best Drama. The first season received 24 nominations, bringing the show's total to 40 across its first two seasons.</p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116" data-mce-href="/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/" data-ref-id="1100-6532688" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/">its debut on Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Now, CD Projekt Red is bringing the game to Mac almost five years after it was released on PC and consoles.</p><p>Starting on July 17, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com. According to Apple, this port will take advantage of "the advanced technologies of Metal" for a "smooth performance," as well as "sharp visuals, amazing battery life, and seamless gameplay."</p><p>The game will also have support for spatial audio and head-tracked spatial audio on Mac, which can be utilized with AirPods. Cyberpunk 2077 can be run on Apple silicon Mac configurations with 16GB or more of unified memory. But for the best performance, it's strongly suggested for systems on macOS 15.5 or later.</p><p>Although Cyberpunk 2077 is no longer in active development, there is still at least one more big update to the game underway. However, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/">recently delayed update 2.3 for an indefinite period</a>. The stated reason was that the programing team needs more time, and the update will apparently in "a scope similar to Update 2.2."</p><p>Meanwhile, the sequel has taken on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/" data-ref-id="1100-6531871" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/">working title of Cyberpunk 2</a>. That game may be several years away, but Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has already hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/" data-ref-id="1100-6531705" data-mce-href="/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/">the sequel will include a second city</a> alongside Night City from the first game.</p>
