The book goes behind the scenes of the making of each Heroes of Might and Magic game, charting its humble origins and how it evolved over the years to become a staple in the turn-based-fantasy genre. Alongside a breakdown of the Heroes of Might and Magic games, you can also explore never-before-seen art, documentation, and interviews with key members of the creative teams.</p>                      </div><p>Heroes of Might and Magic has had multiple games over the years, starting in 1995 when it spun off from the main Might and Magic series. The rights to the IP were originally held by New World Computing, which was later acquired by 3DO.</p><p>After 3DO closed down, these rights were then sold to Ubisoft, with the first game under new ownership being Heroes of Might and Magic 5. Following a lengthy hiatus after the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 7 in 2015, Ubisoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era/" data-ref-id="5000-640663">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</a>, which is being produced by Iratus: Lord of the Dead developer Unfrozen. The new game will be released later this year through Steam Early Access on PC.</p><p>For more cool collectibles, you can check out several other books at Dark Horse Direct focused on the art behind specific video games. These range from The Last of Us to Mass Effect, and several of them have been discounted recently.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also preorder jigsaw puzzles designed to celebrate the legacy of developer Naughty Dog.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>According to Yoji Fujito, the producer and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xi/" data-ref-id="5000-967">Final Fantasy XI</a>, ongoing support for the game could have ended in 2024. Player interest was high enough that Square Enix ultimately decided not to stop supporting the MMO, though, and a series of new updates is expected throughout this spring and summer.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI was the first MMO in the long-running RPG series, and it first launched for PS2 in Japan on May 16, 2002. Live-service support for the MMO, which is now played on PC, has continued ever since. Final Fantasy XI, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xi-review/1900-6083638/" data-ref-id="1900-6083638">GameSpot reviewed all the way back in 2003</a>, has survived Square's merger with Enix, the disastrous launch and lauded rebirth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, and all of the other changes in the MMO space that have happened in the 23 years since its launch. It's not the most popular MMO, but it has a dedicated and passionate fanbase.</p><p>That dedicated fanbase ultimately saved the game. In an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202505/42194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dengeki Online</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-considered-ending-final-fantasy-11-in-2024-but-player-interest-was-high-enough-to-keep-it-alive-even-after-20-years/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Fujito explained that Square Enix had previously considered ending support for Final Fantasy XI by 2024 following the end of The Voracious Resurgence storyline.</p><p>"There was a real possibility that 2024 would be the year updates would come to an end, with the game shifting into a so-called maintenance mode, where only system upkeep would be performed," Fujito said. "We thought, if The Voracious Resurgence wrapped up and FFXI clearly started losing its momentum, then maybe we really should prepare to end it. But that didn’t happen. I took this as a sign that we should keep running the game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENQMmY3jmkk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ENQMmY3jmkk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultimately, Fujito says the fact that Final Fantasy XI has continued to receive "a lot of support" from players is the reason why Square Enix is still committed to supporting it now. A series of updates for Year 23 of service was recently revealed too, including a new High-Tier Mission Battlefield called The Orb's Radiance, a new Master Trial called Wing of War, the ability to pay to change your character's race, gender, face, hair, and size, gamepad configuration support, and more.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI is available on PC, and support for it does not seem to be ending anytime soon.</p>

                <p>If you're the type of player who likes to share video footage of your mad skills, you may be disappointed to hear that clips recorded on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will apparently be limited to only 30 seconds.</p><p>According to the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-today-app-announced-will-include-switch-2-news-and-more/1100-6530427/"> Nintendo Today app</a>, the Switch 2 will have the same 30-second video capture limitation as the original Switch. And while the average player just looking to grab a quick clip of a cool in-game moment isn't likely to be particularly bothered by this constraint, it's likely to be much more frustrating for enthusiasts who were hoping the Switch 2 would provide upgraded abilities.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Switch 2's 30-second cap on video capture falls behind the abilities of the PS5, which can capture up to 30 minutes internally or 60 minutes on external storage. For Switch 2 users to obtain similar capabilities, they'd need to invest in an external capture card, which can be a costly venture.</p><p>No word has been shared on whether the Switch 2 can capture video at higher resolutions and frame rates than the original Switch, which was capped at 720p and 30 fps. It seems likely that the new console will improve on this at least marginally, but Nintendo has yet to comment.</p><p>Maybe we'll know more before the Switch 2 launches June 5. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/" data-ref-id="1100-6531631">GameChat accessibility features</a> and look over all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">confirmed and rumored games coming to the console</a>.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The next major collaboration coming to Overwatch was teased last week, as Capcom's Street Fighter franchise will become the first-ever video game franchise to join Blizzard's hero shooter. Eight of Overwatch's heroes will be given the Street Fighter treatment, as they'll be able to dress up as eight of SF's world warriors, with some new themed emotes to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with Overwatch art director Dion Rogers and former character art director Arnold Tsang to talk about bringing Street Fighter to Overwatch, from the character-selection process to how Street Fighter inspired some of Overwatch's design choices from the very beginning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="11520" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281"></a><figcaption>The eight Overwatch 2 X Street Fighter skins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Match made in heaven"</h2><p dir="ltr">From the beginning of discussions–"about a year ago," according to Rogers--the Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration has been what Tsang describes as "a match made in heaven." A big part of that, as Rogers describes, is Capcom's shared background in developing games.</p><p dir="ltr">"With some of our collaborations, there's a little bit more explaining to do," Rogers says. "Capcom though, they do this. They make games. They get it. If we come to them and say, 'Hey, there's some technical challenges with this, we're going to have to edit this look,' they understand. The back-and-forth between us and Capcom was really nice."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom also gave the Overwatch team "complete say" in which heroes would be included from the Overwatch side, as well as the Street Fighter characters they would be paired with. There was only one caveat: The Street Fighter characters had to come from the roster of the current game, Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr">"We had complete say on what that would look like," Rogers says. "Capcom gave some suggestions after reviewing things with us, but we have a ton of Street Fighter fans on the team, so the concept artists already had ideas. Ultimately, we had a conversation together that landed on which hero we choose as the right hero for a character."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Finding the right pair</h2><p dir="ltr">The team at Overwatch, with Capcom's input, eventually settled on eight Overwatch heroes and the Street Fighter characters they'd be portraying:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Cammy as Widowmaker</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kimiko as Juri</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Some of these decisions allowed the team to explore new facets of a hero; pairing Widowmaker with Cammy, a natural fit given their assassin or "femme fatale" background, also offered a unique opportunity to show Widowmaker with a more human-like skin color as opposed to her trademark purple.</p><p dir="ltr">Other groups presented unique challenges; making Sigma into M. Bison, for example, resulted in Sigma donning a cape, which is not usually part of his outfit. "It doesn't affect gameplay too much," Rogers said. "Usually the animations and the movement of the hero kind of dictate who they are, but Bison now becomes a unique skin for Sigma because of the cape; no other Sigma skin has that."</p><p dir="ltr">The best parts of designing the skins, however, were when the animators could inject parts of the Street Fighter character's background into unexpected places. Hanzo as Ryu might seem like it poses a challenge--Ryu is no archer, after all--but the team immediately paired the two as the design process was evolving.</p><p dir="ltr">"Everything else [with the pair] fits perfectly, but the fact that Hanzo's an archer? We thought, 'Well, everyone else has guns,'" Arnold Tsang said. "If Ryu was going to be in Overwatch, he'd probably pick up the bow in favor of something else."</p><p dir="ltr">The Hanzo pairing also let Tsang add that unexpected reference too--"In Street Fighter, Ryu has that white bag he usually travels with," Tsang explains. "If you look at the Hanzo skin, his quiver isn't actually a holder for the arrows. It looks more like that duffel bag, to mimic the traveling Ryu."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497280"></a><figcaption>Overwatch 2 X Street Fighter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Overwatch Fighter</h2><p dir="ltr">When asked if the team was surprised by how naturally the two properties fit together, Tsang says he knew immediately it would work, simply because Street Fighter is "in the DNA" of both Overwatch and his own artistic approach. "I learned how to draw by studying the Street Fighter and Capcom artists," Tsang explains.</p><p dir="ltr">He attributes this to why, from a visual perspective, the two sides meshed so well together. "I remember in the beginning, when we were making the game, we had our first few heroes, and one of the big decisions we made was we wanted heroes from different countries," Tsang says."That was hugely inspired by Street Fighter; I used to have a poster where I would see the different characters and the little flag beside their names. So, when we made Overwatch, I thought 'Let's bring some of that energy into the game and have all these characters from different countries, influenced by their culture.' Some of that DNA is there, in these heroes from all around the world coming together."</p><p dir="ltr">Now that Street Fighter is entering Overwatch, what if the roles were reversed and a hero for Overwatch joined the battle in Street Fighter? Tsang has a few ideas on who might best fit on the Street Fighter roster from the Overwatch squad.</p><p dir="ltr">"Genji and Doomfist are melee characters, so those are no-brainers," Tsang says. "A lot of the heroes have guns, so it's harder to imagine how they'd fit into a traditional fighting game, as it makes the martial arts aspect less creative. Hanzo has a bow, but he also has the sword; he could use that too." Eventually, Tsang settles on one of the first names he mentioned: Doomfist, who according to Tsang, was "designed to be a fighting game character, basically."</p><p dir="ltr">The Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration begins May 20 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has rolled out a new Xbox update allows players to further customize the home screen, and the changes sound pretty nice. For now, the new features are available only to Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha users, before everyone else gets to try it later. You can <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for the free Xbox Insider program</a> to get early access to Xbox updates.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's received feedback from fans that they want the Home screen on Xbox to feel more personalized. Specifically, fans have asked for Microsoft to hide tiles they don't regularly use, and in general, make the Home screen feel "less crowded." This new update is an attempt to give fans some updates with those concerns in mind, Microsoft said.</p><p>"This update is part of our ongoing effort to make Home more personal, flexible, and responsive to your feedback," the company explained.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269" data-ratio="0.54969749351772" data-width="1157" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269"></a><figcaption>You can now further customize the Xbox Home screen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png"></figure><p>So what's in the new update? To begin with, the Home screen now has three new settings, the first of which is "Hide System Apps." Whereas system apps would previously show up under "recently played games," this will no longer happen. The second new setting is "Pin Favorites to Home," and this allows users to pin up to three recently played games or apps to the recently played list. "These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles," Microsoft said.</p><p>The third is "Reduce Tile Count." This isn't available yet, but when it does arrive, users will be able to reduce the number of tiles that show up in the recently played games and apps list. "We're still refining this setting, and it will be coming soon," Microsoft said.</p><p>In other news, Microsoft just recently raised Xbox console prices, while the company will start <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">charging $80 for games later this year.</a> The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a> is coming June 8, with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> broadcast to follow immediately after.</p>

                <p>Summer is typically a great time to head outside, enjoy the warmer weather, and work on your tan, but if you're into video games, it's also a season of announcements. Similar to previous years, various developers and publishers are gearing up to reveal what they're working on, as they'll be taking to the internet for a series of livestreams. From indie games to upcoming AAA releases, the next couple of months are going to be a busy--but entertaining--time in the industry.</p><p>If you're looking to stay up to date on when these livestreams are being held, we'll be keeping track of everything and updating this post whenever a new livestream is announced. For now, there's a lot to look forward to already as Geoff Keighley's annual Summer Game Fest, the feel-good Wholesome Direct, and the Xbox Games Showcase are all confirmed for this year. A few other events are also coming even sooner--a clever move that will allow these respective initiatives more time to shine.</p><p>Here's a closer look at everything on the way.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#May_22">May 22</a><ul><li><a href="#Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</a></li><li><a href="#Six_One_Indie_Showcase">Six One Indie Showcase</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#May_29">May 29</a><ul><li><a href="#Indie_Quest">Indie Quest</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_6">June 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Access_Ability_Summer_Showcase">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#Summer_Game_Fest">Summer Game Fest</a></li><li><a href="#Day_of_the_Devs">Day of the Devs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_7">June 7</a><ul><li><a href="#Wholesome_Direct">Wholesome Direct</a></li><li><a href="#Future_Games_Show">Future Games Show</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_8">June 8</a><ul><li><a href="#Xbox_Games_Showcase">Xbox Games Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_Direct">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a></li><li><a href="#PC_Gaming_Show">PC Gaming Show</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="May_22">May 22</h2><h3 id="Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</h3><p><strong>Where to watch</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@officialwarhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li></ul><p><strong>When to watch</strong></p><ul><li><strong>PT: </strong>9 AM</li><li><strong>ET: </strong>12 PM</li><li><strong>BST: </strong>5 PM</li></ul><p>For all things grimdark in video games, the Warhammer Skulls livestream is the place to be.
