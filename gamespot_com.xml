                <p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/">PlayStation Wrap-Up</a>, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1999147161989128217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap</a> has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?</p><p>While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/">we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September</a>, and Blizzard has teased its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/">biggest year yet</a>" for 2026.</p><p>Outside of Microsoft, several other gaming franchises will also have plenty of reasons to celebrate. The 30th anniversary of Pokemon is next year, Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and both The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania will reach the 40th anniversary milestone in 2026.</p><p>We have contacted Xbox to find out if there are any plans for a year-in-review wrap-up, and will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

                <p>The College Football bowl season is underway, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-football-is-now-an-xbox-as-xbox-is-sponsoring-a-college-football-bowl-game-this-year/1100-6536706/" data-ref-id="1100-6536706">first-ever Xbox Bowl</a> took place on December 18--and what a sight it was.</p><p>Arkansas State defeated Missouri State 34-28 to claim the title. Arkansas State was up 31-7 going into the fourth, but Missouri State battled back, scoring 21 points in the fourth to make it close.</p><p>Naturally, the Xbox Bowl was full of Xbox-branded partnerships, including Master Chief doing the coin toss to start the game. Corey Rucker Jr. of Arkansas State won Offensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, earning himself an <a href="https://x.com/ESPNCFB/status/2001894073200701877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Achievement Unlocked"</a> trophy, while Kyle Taylor of Arkansas State won Defensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, taking home a similarly styled trophy.</p><p>As for the actual trophy for the champions, Master Chief was driven to midfield in a Warthog to present Arkansas State with the trophy, which took the form of an Rog Xbox Ally strapped onto a football-shaped piece of metal with the Xbox logo on it.</p><p>Both teams also received Xbox systems in the form of the Rog Xbox Ally handheld, and you can see in the video below that players from Missouri State were pretty stoked.</p><p>The popular College Football Campus Tour, which documents obstructed views at stadiums, even reported back from the Xbox Bowl, which was held at The Ford Center in Frisco, Texas. Section 204 Row 16 and Seat 23 had only 36% field visibility, which is pretty rough, as you can tell from the image below.</p><p>Check out some additional images from the Xbox Bowl below, as shared on social media.</p>
