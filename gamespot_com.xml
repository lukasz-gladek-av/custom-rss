                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> excels at making players feel like an unstoppable tank, but developer Id Software is looking to make the game more challenging. What's interesting here is that Id will make use of what it calls "Tunables," a system that allows it to update parts of the game without needing to release a patch.</p><p>While Tunables can't fix complex systemic, content, or code-related bugs, they can adjust parts of the new Doom game to create subtle but noticeable changes. Overall, players wanting to test their mettle on Nightmare difficulty can expect to start sweating, as enemies like the Cosmic Baron and Hellknight will start doing more damage. <a href="https://x.com/DOOM/article/1925721303987757124/media/1925707376557977600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Id says that it wanted to increase the threat level</a> of these enemies on Nightmare difficulty, and as an example, missing a parry on the Agaddon Hunter's overhead slash will break your shield and leave you vulnerable for a short period.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Doom: The Dark Ages Has a Power Problem</p>
      </div>
<p>"There are systems under the hood that are designed to give players a better chance to survive when near death, and those systems were being too generous," Id explained. "Players were able to brute-force their way through situations that should've resulted in costing a Life Sigil or death, and we want to make sure we are keeping the player in check and asking for better tactical decisions. These changes will have an impact on player survivability and will be more noticeable the higher up the Damage Scale slider you go."</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-3-million-players-right-away-and-the-majority-of-them-are-on-game-pass-apparently/1100-6531702/">and right out of the gate, it hit 3 million players</a>. That's seven times quicker than Doom Eternal, but it's worth noting that 2 million players came from Game Pass alone, as The Dark Ages was a day-one release on that service. While that figure is impressive, it's still not clear if The Dark Ages is doing well commercially, given how cagey Bethesda is with details on development and marketing costs for the game.</p><p>"Doom: The Dark Ages reinvents and reins in with equal measure, taking the series in a bold new direction without straying from its captivating roots," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>.</p>

                <p>Google has released a new AI video generation tool, and it's clearly very familiar with what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> gameplay looks like. The advanced AI tool generated some very convincing Fortnite footage in response to a simple prompt, churning out a clip that's almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</p><p>Veo 3, the latest video generation model from Google DeepMind, released this week, and already is creating some concerningly realistic footage with its added capacity to generate lifelike audio. The AI tool is also showing a blatant disregard for intellectual property--which may be of more concern to many of the companies that have been quick to implement AI technology.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dystopian-google-ai-video-generator-generating-fake-fortnite-clips-and-its-tough-to-tell-the-difference" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, X user <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Matt Schumer</a> posted a short clip generated by Veo 3 that shows a streamer winning a game of Fortnite. While it looks a little odd to have the streamer's face cam superimposed over a shot of a computer monitor, rather than direct gameplay footage, the clip is otherwise indistinguishable from real Fortnite gameplay.</p><p>Schumer later shared that the prompt for the clip didn't actually mention Fortnite at all, and was just nine words long--"Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe." While a direct prompt to generate Fortnite footage would get blocked by Veo's content filters, Schumer discovered that key terms like "Victory Royale" and "pickaxe" were enough for the tool to understand that he was talking about Fortnite. Schumer also showed that the AI tool will generate pure gameplay footage without a streamer overlay.</p><p>Veo 3's ability to generate such convincing Fortnite footage shows that the tool has likely been trained on plenty of copyrighted content, and raises interesting questions about how copyright law will handle generative AI. It's yet to be seen if Epic--or any other company whose IPs can be this easily copied by AI--will do anything in response.</p><p>Epic Games also uses AI tools, including in the development of Fortnite. Most recently, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">allowed players to interact with</a> an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI-powered Darth Vader</a> who interacts with the player in the voice of James Earl Jones. Voice actors union SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">filed a complaint</a> against Epic Games for its use of AI voice acting.</p>

                <p>The latest update for SteamOS is here, after months of development in beta. SteamOS Version 3.7.8 includes a lot of fixes and improvements on a system level, and will also introduce a battery saver feature for the Steam Deck for the first time.</p><p>The new battery saver option is called Battery Charge Limit, and can be found under the Power submenu in Settings. The feature allows users to set a maximum charge limit for their Steam Deck, with a maximum of 80% charge recommended for devices that are usually left on charge, or that rarely have their battery fully depleted.</p><p>This kind of feature, designed to prolong the working life of lithium-ion batteries, is already commonly implemented in devices like mobile phones and laptops, and now is starting to become more common in the gaming space. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-a-switch-2-setting-that-prevents-its-battery-from-deteriorating/1100-6531462/" data-ref-id="1100-6531462">Nintendo recently revealed</a> that the Switch 2 will have a similar feature, which will stop the hybrid handheld console from charging once it reaches 90%.</p><p>The SteamOS update also includes a number of other notable changes that will improve the OS from the ground up--with upgrades to the system's Linux base, and the Mesa graphics driver base. Version 3.7.8 will also improve the Steam Deck's desktop experience, with an upgrade to Plasma 6.2.5 for an overall smoother and more modern desktop experience.</p><p>The latest update also improves support for third-party devices, including AMD-powered devices like the ROG Ally and original Lenovo Legion Go, as well as adding official support for the newer Legion Go S.</p><p>SteamOS users can also expect a decent amount of other bug fixes, compatibility improvements and other enhancements to the system. Check out the full list of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/820329049655084701" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>Steam OS 3.7.8</h2><p><b>General</b></p><ul><li>Updated to a newer Arch Linux base</li><li>Updated the Linux kernel to 6.11</li><li>Updated the Mesa graphics driver base</li><li>Desktop mode now ships with Plasma 6.2.5</li><li>Added support for frame limiting with VRR displays (internal and external)</li><li>Added Battery Charge Limit control to Settings-&gt;Power  <ul><li>This option allows you to set a maximum charge limit for your Steam Deck.</li><li>Limiting the charge limit to 80% can be beneficial for long term battery health.
