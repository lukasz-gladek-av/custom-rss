                <p>Last month, Aspyr shadow-dropped the Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review/1900-6415647/" data-ref-id="1900-6415647">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a>, the 2013 reboot that kicked off a new era for Lara Croft. According to Aspyr, the response has been so strong that more Tomb Raider games may make the leap to Switch 2.</p><p>Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a> about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-285252">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-479759">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>--coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them.</p><p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," said Reese. "We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p><p>Reese also indicated that more patches will be added for Tomb Raider's Switch ports, but didn't share any details beyond that. Tomb Raider is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-2013-is-getting-a-portable-edition/1100-6537046/" data-ref-id="1100-6537046">slated to be ported to mobile platforms</a> in February 2026.</p><p>The next two games in the franchise were announced earlier this month. Crystal Dynamics will debut a remake of the original game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-catalyst-revealed-alongside-original-tomb-raider-remake/1100-6536853/" data-ref-id="1100-6536853">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, in 2026. That will be followed in 2027 by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-catalyst/" data-ref-id="5000-562110">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, a brand-new adventure for Lara Croft.</p><p>Camilla Luddington--the voice of Lara Croft through the Survivor trilogy--recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-actor-shares-her-heartfelt-farewell-to-lara-croft/1100-6536958/" data-ref-id="1100-6536958">her farewell to the role</a>, as well as her best wishes to her successor, Alix Wilton Regan.</p><p>Outside of the games, Prime Video's Tomb Raider TV series will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-star-sophie-turner-confirmed-to-play-lara-croft-in-tv-series/1100-6534452/" data-ref-id="1100-6534452">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-show-will-feature-avatars-sigourney-weaver-role-revealed/1100-6536945/" data-ref-id="1100-6536945">Avatar's Sigourney Weaver</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-finds-another-actor-joining-sophie-turners-lara-croft/1100-6536605/" data-ref-id="1100-6536605">Martin Bobb-Semple</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-adds-another-big-name-to-its-cast/1100-6537090/" data-ref-id="1100-6537090">Jason Isaacs</a> in supporting roles.

                <p>Sucker Punch Productions co-founder Brian Fleming is leaving the gaming studio after working there since it opened 28 years ago in 1997. What's he doing next? Fleming says he does not know.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Fleming said, "I really don't know what's next."</p><p>He's staying with Sucker Punch through April 2026 to help with the transition efforts, and after that he said he plans to travel. He's also going to spend the time trying to "sort out which opportunities" he wants to pursue next. Fleming said he's considering a lot of different options for the future, including staying in games, moving to the wider technology space, getting into the "entertainment" business, and even working in the "advocacy/politics" areas.</p><p>"After 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe," he said.</p><p>Jason Connell (Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei co-creative director) and Adrian Bentley (technical director) will take over as co-studio heads on January 1. Nate Fox will continue his role as co-creative director. Fleming said he's leaving Sucker Punch "in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had."</p><p>"They are all so capable and so READY for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish," he explained.</p><p>After releasing the N64 game Rocket: Robot on Wheels in 1999, Sucker Punch's first big hit was 2002's Sly Cooper, which became a franchise that spawned multiple sequels. In 2009, the studio released Infamous, which would also become a success. Sony acquired Sucker Punch in 2011.</p><p>Next up for Sucker Punch in 2026's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-free-multiplayer-dlc-next-year/1100-6534104/" data-ref-id="1100-6534104">Ghost of Yotei: Legends</a>, which is free multiplayer DLC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Bloomberg reported</a> that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.</p><p>According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has "taken a larger role" in the company's gaming business recently.</p><p>The Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios.</a> Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">these cuts had to happen because of capitalism. </a></p><p>Microsoft was also planning to charge $80 for new games this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">canceled those plans</a>. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a "healthy business," but this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.</a></p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>Next year is poised to be a big one for Microsoft, as 2026 marks the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo</a>. It's also the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the 30th anniversary of the original Diablo. Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">new information about the company's new console</a> in 2026, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Microsoft will host an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2026</a> where it will show off some of what's coming to Xbox in 2026, but not everything.</p>
