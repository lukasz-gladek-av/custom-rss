                <p>Netflix has announced that it's adding a bunch of party games to its catalog, and unlike many of the streamer's other games, these are playable directly on your TV with your phone as a controller.</p><p>"We're creating a completely new way to play games--one that's as easy as streaming a show on a Friday night," Netflix said in a <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Five games are being added to the Games tab on Netflix, including Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers. All of them are playable with multiple people at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4582630-screenshot2025-10-09at9.44.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582630" data-ratio="0.56521739130435" data-width="920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4582630-screenshot2025-10-09at9.44.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582630"></a><figcaption>Netflix is adding more games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4582630-screenshot2025-10-09at9.44.40%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Netflix said its goal is to help the platform become a place you don't need to leave. The company cited an example of a family or friend group gathering for a holiday party to watch something and then transition to playing a game, without having to leave the Netflix platform. It sounds like Netflix is going after the market that the Jackbox games popularized, as those titles are also playable on a TV with phones as input devices.</p><p>"This is just the beginning--stay tuned for more news and get ready to play, connect and have fun together on Netflix," the company said.</p><p>Beyond the games playable on your TV, Netflix offers a variety of mobile games, including Civilization VI, GTA: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition, Solitaire, Farming Simulator 23, Oxenfree, Street Fighter IV CE, Sonic Mania Plus, Football Manager 24, and more.</p><p>In July,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263"> Netflix said it would "ramp up" its gaming efforts</a>. Netflix was at one point working on a AAA game and hired big names, including Halo veteran Joseph Staten, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">that project has been shut down</a> because it didn't align with what Netflix wanted.</p><p>In other news, Netflix is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-hiring-a-new-genai-gaming-boss-with-a-huge-salary/1100-6535200/" data-ref-id="1100-6535200">hiring a new generative AI boss to help come up with systems and strategies for using generative AI in its future games.</a></p>

                <p>Controversial billionaire <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elon Musk made a bold claim</a> this week that his xAI game studio will deliver a "great" AI-generated game by the end of 2026. The comment was soon met with a wave of criticism from industry professionals, and publishing director Michael "Cromwelp" Douse from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios didn't mince his words in response to Musk's plans.</p><p>"Genuinely, what this industry needs is not more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops, [but] rather more expressions of worlds that folks are engaged with, or want to engage with," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975327370924994657" rel="nofollow ">Douse posted online</a>. "AI has its place as a tool, but we have all the tools in the world, and they aren't compensating for the incredible lack of cogent direction. AI isn't going to solve the big problem of the industry, which is leadership and vision."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975328682680914329" rel="nofollow ">In a series of follow-up posts</a>, Douse explained that he believes the human factor and connecting with audiences are the keys to success. "Those who will succeed are those who are people building something for people," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975329606602248386" rel="nofollow ">Douse added</a>, while also decrying how the technology sector had fallen victim to "cash-grabs" led by venture capital firms. "There is no craft without the human touch; the relative skill issue, or 'the exhibition of otherness.' To turn games into digital, emotionless content is to abandon all resonance--which is why people play!"</p><p>Douse's comments echo some of the sentiments from a speech <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/">given by Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke</a> during The Game Awards last year. During his time on the stage, <a href="https://youtu.be/YvRm4HKK4gQ" rel="nofollow ">Vincke spoke</a> about how the winning formula for a game was "stupidly simple" but somehow kept getting lost.</p><p>While it remains to be seen if the xAI-developed game will ever materialize, it is worth noting that Musk has a long history of overpromising and underdelivering on his projects, including plans for the high-speed Hyperloop project, self-driving cars that don't require human interaction, and landing people on Mars by 2024.</p><p>As for Larian, the studio's next project--codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">Excalibur</a>-- is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/">currently in development</a>.</p>

<p>The publisher went on to say that the anti-cheat tools in Black Ops 7's beta "adapted and improved" over time, helping to ensure "more players experience the clean matches they expect."</p><p>Activision added that it has spent years investing in and refining the anti-cheat tools to get to where things stand today, and it's not the end. The publisher said it will continue to work on improving the anti-cheat tools so that people feel can feel confident they played a clean and fair match.</p><p>"We're not done yet," Activision said. "Ricochet anti-cheat keeps adapting to protect your time and your matches, and most important, earn your trust. There's much more to come."</p><p>When the Black Ops 7 beta went live on October 2, people quickly spotted videos of apparent cheating in the test.
