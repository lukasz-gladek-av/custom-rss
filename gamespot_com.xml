                <p>The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.</p><p>According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.</p><p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said</a> some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.</p><p>The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. </p><p>"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back," center Tyler Linderbaum said. "We have 11 games left to try to run the table."</p><p>The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. </p>

                <p>In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/scarface-the-world-is-yours/" data-ref-id="5000-21399">Scarface: The World is Yours</a> was released as an alternate timeline sequel to the classic 1983 film starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. The game has been unavailable for a long time, but it's recently shown up as a pending re-release on Epic Games Store and Steam. However, no one seems to have heard of the publisher, EC Digital, and it's unclear if it's actually happening.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/a-publisher-nobodys-heard-of-has-unintentionally-re-released-2006s-scarface-the-world-is-yours-early-and-im-not-so-sure-bout-this-one-boss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Scarface: The World is Yours was accidentally released early on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and the game page is still active. It's also listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, which included an explanation for the early release.</p><p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned. We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version," the statement reads.</p><p>Because Scarface went live prematurely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m3rcc3p2ep2j" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> and others noted that it includes two fan-made patches, SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, which make the game playable. The creator of SilentPatch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cookieplmonster.bsky.social/post/3m3rcwjmhps2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Silent</a>, notes that the patches were incorporated into this release without permission, but also acknowledges that it wasn't "necessary as per the license, but would be nice."</p><p>Attempts to reach EC Digital didn't turn up any contact info, and it's unknown if Universal sanctioned this re-release. Following the initial reports, EC Digital has shared a statement on Steam that it has asked Valve to temporarily hide the page "while we worked through ongoing licensing and technical matters."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1980996726572954007" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Updated notice on Scarface on Steam <a href="https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v</a><br>"We’ve recently entered urgent discussions with multiple parties concerning the project’s status.

If things change and we're able to bring the game back in the future, we'll let you know right away."</p><p>For now, this doesn't appear to be going forward.

                <p>The idea of exclusive games in 2025 is "antiquated," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. She said in a new interview that people are beginning to "evolve way past" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.</p><p>"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people," she told <a href="https://youtu.be/yDmwJ7tuoD8?si=GKqqs8S6R2L7458R" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>.</p><p>"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Rog Ally X</a>]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room," she added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="435">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=435" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.</p><p>For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.</p><p>Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-wont-be-announced-until-2026-report/1100-6535565/" data-ref-id="1100-6535565">this will be announced in 2026.</a></p><p>In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.</a></p><p>Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">"high-end"</a> and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.</p>
