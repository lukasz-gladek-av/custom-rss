                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,</a> has arrived on PlayStation 5. While players continue to pour over the details, they may find a few Easter eggs that were placed in the game by Kojima himself. According to Kojima, he only took that hands-on approach because his staff refused to do it for him.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2s-kojima-related-easter-eggs-were-all-self-inserted-because-his-team-refused-to-humor-him/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kojima confirmed that he personally added those nods to his past. He went on to say that when his staff was asked to include his self-referential jokes, they would pretend they didn't hear him.</p><p>It's possible that Kojima was only joking about his staff's lack of enthusiasm for his ideas, but he did share the details about where one of his Easter eggs is hidden. He noted that it can be found when players visit a hot spring and look up at the sky before zooming in on the stars.</p><p>Later this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-art-book-goes-behinds-the-scenes-on-death-stranding-2-on-the-beachs-development/1100-6532664/" data-ref-id="1100-6532664">The Art of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> will offer an in-depth look at the creation of Kojima's latest game. But we can't say for certain if it will include any references to his Easter eggs.

                <p><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google</a> will be making a major policy change on who will be allowed to stream on YouTube, which will affect a lot of young people. As of July 22, new guidelines state that the minimum age required to livestream will be raised to 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, YouTube allows teens aged 13 and above to stream solo, as is also the case with Twitch. However, the new rules (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-changes-live-streaming-policy/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>) will mean that creators will need to be 16 years or older to livestream on the platform. Children between the ages of 13-15 will still be allowed to appear on a livestream but the policy states that they must be "visibly accompanied by an adult" or else their live chat will be disabled and their account "may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features."</p><p dir="ltr">These new measures may impact young creators trying to build an online following without the intrusion of parental supervision, but it's also a sign that YouTube is prioritising online safety for children. The policy is also only regarding livestreaming, so there does not currently appear to be any new age restriction when it comes to posting pre-recorded videos.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">Roblox also placed new restrictions on its youngest users</a> by restricting kids under 13 from accessing unrated experiences or social hangouts, following repeated accusations that the platform was failing to protect children from would-be predators.</p>
