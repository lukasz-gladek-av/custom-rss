                <p>Despite Activision's efforts to curb cheating among some Call of Duty players, it remains an issue even in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops. 6</a>. But now, there's potentially cause for celebration among CoD fans as Phantom Overlay, one of the most prominent cheat developers, has announced that it is shutting down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-phantom-overlay-cheat-provider-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant</a>, Phantom Overlay's <a href="https://t.me/PhantomOverlayAnnouncements/1052" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram channel</a> states that it plans to "immediately" close its operations, with a caveat that it will remain online for at least another month to fulfill the 30-day keys that it has already sold players. Phantom Overlay went on to promise that anyone who bought lifetime keys would get a partial refund.</p><p>"This is not an exit scam and no external entity could ever compel me to exit scam my customers," wrote the creator of Phantom Overlay. "I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p>There was no information in the post about why Phantom Overlay is closing down, and <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Dark_TM/status/1896214682727579879" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some players online are naturally skeptical</a>. Phantom Overlay successfully monetized CoD cheats, and the creator could theoretically try again with a different company or a new alias. As noted by one user on X, Phantom Overlay's cheats <a href="https://twitter.com/InsuredFrames/status/1896052805653426600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were reputed to be undetectable</a>, while rival cheat-makers have struggled with that.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/27000-call-of-duty-cheaters-were-banned-this-past-weekend/1100-6522492/" data-ref-id="1100-6522492">27,000 CoD cheaters were banned in a single weekend</a>. Activision's Call of Duty anti-cheat program, Ricochet, shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheaters-may-now-lose-their-parachutes-sending-them-plummeting-to-their-death/1100-6519058/" data-ref-id="1100-6519058">its ambitious anti-cheat CoD plans</a>, but Activision has previously apologized for not being able to kick cheaters out of Black Ops. 6 ranked play as quickly as promised. Activision has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-call-of-duty-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-3-million-to-activision/1100-6511845/" data-ref-id="1100-6511845">sued cheat developers in the past</a>, and successfully won a $3 million judgment against them. Regardless, the battle between Activision and the cheaters will likely continue well into the future regardless of whether Phantom Overlay makes a comeback under a new name. In the meantime, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a> to get more feedback from players.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It was a record-breaking weekend on Steam, propelled in part by Monster Hunter Wilds becoming the platform's No. 5 title of all time for concurrent players. The action-adventure game had over 1.3 million people looking to take down fantastical beats on Saturday--and that number doesn't even include PS5 and Xbox Series X|S users.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> itself saw over 40 million users for the first time ever on Sunday.

concurrent players</a> with over 2.2 million people. A little over a year ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-just-passed-2-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-only-second-game-to-ever-to-do-so/1100-6520583/">Palworld passed 2 million concurrent players on Steam</a>, at the time becoming only the second game to ever do so on Valve's platform. PUBG still holds the record with 3.2 million.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds just launched a few days ago on Friday, February 28, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-off-to-an-amazing-start-on-pc-smashing-through-several-steam-records/1100-6529783/">got off to an amazing start on PC</a>. The game smashed previous Steam records for the franchise. For instance, Monster Hunter World only topped 300,000 concurrent players on the service, though World was not a simultaneous release with the console versions as Wilds was. Additionally, Monster Hunter Wilds saw more players on release day than Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077. However, despite its popularity, some PC players have experienced performance issues with the action-adventure game, leading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mixed reviews on Steam</a>. Monster Hunter has become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/#2">Capcom's second-best-selling franchise of all time</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.

                <p>Kenji Ozawa, the co-director on Visions of Mana, has started a new studio called Studio Sasanqua after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/visions-of-mana-studio-is-shutting-down-just-after-releasing-game-report/1100-6526204/" data-ref-id="1100-6526204">Ouka Studio was shut down by NetEase last year.</a> He's also calling out how management's poor decisions lead to game creators being let go.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-dev-from-netease-games-ouka-studio-establishes-his-own-company-that-wont-push-the-responsibility-of-management-onto-developers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Ozawa said he wanted to start his own studio because he saw management at his previous companies not taking responsibilities for failed projects. While management makes the majority of high-level decisions like approving game pitches and finding investment opportunities, Ozawa noted that it's the developers themselves that get cut when management makes a mistake.</p><p>With Studio Sasanqua, Ozawa wanted to make sure that both developers and management are on the same page, as both departments are usually siloed from each other. He's also prioritizing a sense of security for developers and confirms that he's ready to accept full responsibility if a game fails due to management mistakes.</p><p>While Studio Sasanqua hasn't revealed its first game, Ozawa explained that the studio will focus on smaller projects in Unreal Engine, with the longer-term goal of creating larger-scale games for PC and consoles.</p><p>Ouka Studios was one of the early victims of NetEase's downsizing, as it was shut down not long after the release of its debut game in Visions of Mana. Last month, NetEase suddenly laid off its US-based <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">Marvel Rivals staff despite the game's massive success</a>.

However, NetEase claims that it's still committed to its overseas studios.</p>

                <p>The original Twisted Metal helped set the tone for PS1 when it was released in 1995, but it's been absent from Sony's consoles since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/twisted-metal-review/1900-6350421/" data-ref-id="1900-6350421">the Twisted Metal reboot</a> in 2012. However, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-twisted-metal-live-service-game-canceled-report/1100-6521393/" data-ref-id="1100-6521393">an unannounced Twisted Metal live-service game</a>, which could have revived the series had it not been canceled. Now, one of the developers from that lost Twisted Metal game has shared some details about what could have been.</p><p>UI Programmer Hugo Silva posted <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a handful of screenshots</a> from the Twisted Metal live-service game on his site. Unfortunately, the images are blurred with a note stating that they are under a non-disclosure agreement. Unsurprisingly, vehicular combat played a huge role in the game. But the screenshots also include images of third-person shooter gameplay. So clearly the action was meant to spill out of the vehicles as well, which would have been a departure for the franchise.</p><p>The Twisted Metal live-service game was in development at Firesprite, one of the many developers under Sony's PlayStation Studios banner. It appears that Twisted Metal was still very early in development before its cancelation, but the decision to walk away from it came before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">last year's disastrous Concord launch</a> that forced Sony to rethink its commitment to live-service games.</p><p>It's unclear if Sony has any plans to revisit Twisted Metal games in the future, even though the property has some newfound popularity thanks to the live-action TV series on Peacock. The streamer recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sweet-tooth-and-the-gang-return-in-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-2/1100-6529479/" data-ref-id="1100-6529479">a teaser for Twisted Metal Season 2</a>, which will once again feature Anthony Mackie as John Doe, Stephanie Beatriz as Quiet, Will Arnett as the voice of Sweet Tooth, and former AEW World champion Joe Seanoa--aka Samoa Joe--as the on-set actor portraying Sweet Tooth. Barry's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-casts-barry-star-in-major-role/1100-6524412/" data-ref-id="1100-6524412">Anthony Carrigan is also joining the cast as Calypso</a>, and the series will return to Peacock later this year.</p>

                <p>Former Capcom and Platinum Games director Hideki Kamiya has said that he wants another shot at creating Scalebound, the canceled Xbox game.</p><p>Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, released a video of Kamiya reminiscing about Scalebound while his staff surrounds him. Kamiya talks to his developers about the Scalebound's shooting mechanics and the fact that the main protagonist, Drew, wears headphones and has a smartphone in a world filled with dragons. Kamiya then comments on how Scalebound is like an isekai, a popular genre where the protagonist from the real world gets transported into a fantasy setting, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/" data-ref-id="5000-513783">Forspoken</a>.</p><p>While Clovers' Twitter post about the video ends with Kamiya saying he'd love to make it again, the actual video doesn't show it. However, Kamiya confirmed his sentiments by retweeting the post and referring to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, saying, "Let's do it, Phil!"</p><p>Scalebound was initially planned to launch for Xbox One and PC, but was canceled in January 2017. Over the years since its cancellation, Kamiya has shared his desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-scalebound-director-really-does-want-to-revive-the-canceled-game/1100-6500708/" data-ref-id="1100-6500708">to revive the game in some way</a>.
