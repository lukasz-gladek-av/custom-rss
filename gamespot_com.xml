And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers and modders has blurred over the years, and there are definitely talented fans who can probably work wonders, even with an 18-year-old game engine. In 2021, a group of modders took it upon themselves to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-modders-are-recreating-a-version-with-better-graphics-in-source-2/1100-6495075/" data-ref-id="1100-6495075">recreate Team Fortress 2 in Valve's Source 2 game engine</a>. It should be interesting to see if modders can push the Team Fortress 2 code into something that goes far beyond the scope of the original game.</p><p>Last year, players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">review-bombed Team Fortress 2</a> over the game's ongoing issues with bots, which have been a problem for a few years. Regardless, Valve has continued to offer some additional content for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">including new maps</a>, well after most publishers would have declared the title to be finished.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic is reportedly in discussions to sell its games division to Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely Inc for roughly $3.5 billion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">Scopely was acquired</a> by Saudi Arabia owned Savvy Games in 2023 for $4.9 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit?srnd=undefined" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, the deal could be announced in the coming weeks, although an agreement has not yet been made, so the deal could fall through. The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go. The company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-wizards-unite-is-shutting-down/1100-6497637/">Harry Potter mobile game</a> shut down in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">Niantic laid off 230 people in 2023</a> after canceling a Marvel project and shutting down NBA All-World.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in games in recent years. In 2022, it was reported that the country was looking to invest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-looking-to-invest-almost-38-billion-in-games-industry-could-acquire-a-publisher/1100-6507917/">$38 billion into video game companies</a> and it has made significant investments in companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/">Nintendo</a>. The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has commented on Microsoft's relatively new strategy whereby it launches some of its first-party games on rival platforms, including PS5. For Microsoft, this is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">making money and bringing its games to more people</a>. It's also a win for PS5 owners, according to Yoshida.</p><p>"I think it's a win for PlayStation owners; they didn't have access [to those games] before," he said on the Sacred Symbols podcast, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshida-xbox-games-on-ps5-a-win-for-playstation-owners/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p>Yoshida was at one point managing Sony's first-party game production pipeline before he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">switched positions to running the indies team</a>. When he was running first-party, Yoshida said it was a "nightmare" scenario for PlayStation to become "the minority platform" because that would make it "impossible to maintain the first-party development because the best creators would leave."</p><p>He added: "They are not just creatives, they are business people as well; they want their games to reach the biggest audience as well."</p><p>Microsoft, of course, is in last place as it relates to console sales among the big three, with PS5 and Switch sales outpacing the Series X|S. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">no longer trying to get PS5 owners to switch to Xbox</a> but instead wants to bring more of Microsoft's first-party games to PS5 to meet them where they are.</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing a more platform-agnostic strategy for many years already but only recently has the company actually begun releasing more and more games for PS5 and Switch. For its part, Sony continues to focus on exclusives for its own platforms, while also bringing more games to PC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6143">day-and-date titles for its live-service games. </a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes to PS5 this spring following its debut on Xbox in 2024. After that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> comes out in May for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, launching on all platforms at the same time.</p><p>The RPG Avowed from Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian launched on February 18, but it has not been announced for any platforms outside of Xbox and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Xbox have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> their new generative AI model, Muse, which is the world's first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World and Human Action Model (WHAM)</a>. Muse's stated purpose is to help out studios by generating gameplay during the development process. Microsoft also claimed the technology might be capable of preserving long-unplayable games on obsolete systems.</p><p>It was trained using developer Ninja Theory's now-dormant and abandoned Bleeding Edge game. The developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-theory-drops-bleeding-edge-to-focus-on-hellblade-2-and-other-projects/1100-6486869/" data-ref-id="1100-6486869">dropped support for the game</a> back in 2021 to focus on newer projects. Ninja Theory partnered up with Microsoft Research due to their close proximity to each other in Cambridge, England. Muse used Bleeding Edge to learn about game physics and reactions to players' controller actions.</p><p>According to Xbox, Muse is used for gameplay ideation, and it's already being used to develop a real-time playable AI model trained on other first-party games. Xbox also mentioned how Muse could possibly take older games lost to time and older hardware from its first-party portfolio and optimize them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Xbox claimed that Muse would help teams prototype new gameplay experiences during development and introduce new content. Xbox noted that it's up to its studios whether to participate in the use of generative AI based on their goals and vision, and acknowledged that AI won't be the single solution for every project.</p><p>For Ninja Theory, studio head Dom Matthews said, "It's not about using AI to generate content, but it's actually about creating workflow and approaches that allow our team here of 100 creative experts to do more."</p><p>The subject of AI still remains controversial.
