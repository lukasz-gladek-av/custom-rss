                <p>Three years ago, Dotemu--the publisher behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-turtle-power/1900-6417895/" data-ref-id="1900-6417895">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/streets-of-rage-4-review-the-beat-em-up-boys-are-b/1900-6417460/" data-ref-id="1900-6417460">Streets of Rage 4</a>--announced it was reviving SNK's classic run-and-gun title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-slug-tactics-takes-the-series-in-turn-based-direction/1100-6492662/" data-ref-id="1100-6492662">Metal Slug</a>, as a turn-based tactical title. Now, the wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-slug-tactics-demo-out-now-new-gameplay-trailer-dives-deep-on-combat-and-upgrades/1100-6524118/" data-ref-id="1100-6524118">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is almost over, and it's coming to Game Pass on day one alongside all major consoles and PC next week.</p><p>Dotemu and developer Leikir Studio have released an extended gameplay preview for Metal Slug Tactics that demonstrates what's in store for fans of the series. While the isometric perspective and turn-based action are new, fans of the previous Metal Slug games should recognize the throwback pixel style and the over-the-top weapons utilized by the heroes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiblr_guAQA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hiblr_guAQA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video features Clark Still and Ralf Jones, a duo who made their debut in arcades in SNK's 1986's action title Ikari Warriors. Clark and Ralf previously appeared in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7 before returning for this game. Their new partner in Metal Slug Tactics is Leona Heidern, a woman who has the ability to disguise the team's fallen bad guys as decoy allies that can draw enemy fire away from the heroes.</p><p>Metal Slug Tactics will launch on November 5 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development. Once again set in the Exclusion Zone surrounding the Chornobyl power plant, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-november/1100-6525281/" data-ref-id="1100-6525281">the game will be released</a> for PC and Xbox Series X|S on November 20.</p>
