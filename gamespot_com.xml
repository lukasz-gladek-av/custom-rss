                <p>2025 is shaping up to be a big year for Nintendo, as the Mario company is launching a highly anticipated new system, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. But the company isn't going to rely only on traditional hardware and games to find success. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has opened up on why Nintendo must push "beyond video games" to encourage people to engage with Nintendo.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a>, Furukawa said Nintendo is making use of theme parks, official stores, "visual content," and mobile experiences to "generate interest in our core business." In case there was any doubt, Furukawa stressed that the "dedicated video game platform business" is Nintendo's core business, and efforts outside of that are being undertaken to funnel people back there.</p><p>"Going forward, even as we transition to Nintendo Switch 2, it remains important to increase touchpoints beyond video games," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive said content and experiences for smart phones will play a "very important" role in this effort, and Nintendo will continue to push in this area, Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's push into the mobile market has already reached some 900 million cumulative downloads, Furukawa said, noting that some of Nintendo's success in the smartphone business has come in countries and regions that don't have support for Nintendo's traditional game consoles.</p><p>"I believe this has increased the opportunities for more people to access Nintendo IP and characters," Furukawa said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="928439402"

with Pokemon Go company Niantic. Nintendo shut down online services for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp at the end of 2024 amid a transition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camps-microtransaction-free-version-is-out-now-for-10-doubles-soon/1100-6528152/" data-ref-id="1100-6528152">making it a paid game called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete.</a></p><p>"Although we cannot provide details on future application releases, we are continuing to develop new game applications," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo also has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music app</a>, which launched in 2024 and continues to get updates that add new tracks. In general, Furukawa said Nintendo's aim is to use smartphone apps to "create opportunities for consumers to come into contact with Nintendo game worlds and music even outside of dedicated game systems."</p><p>He added: "Going forward, we would like to continue to develop these types of initiatives, including integration with games, for individual titles."</p><p>Furukawa acknowledged that, for many people, their first gaming platform is not a traditional console but rather a smart device. So Nintendo is trying to meet people where they are, with the assumption being that one day they might pick up a Switch console and games, in addition to whatever they might use and enjoy on their smart phone.</p><p>"We will continue to deliberate on this topic," Furukawa said.</p><p>Even before Furukawa was named president of Nintendo, the company acknowledged that a growing percentage of people first encounter Nintendo experiences outside of a platform that Nintendo sells. For example, previous president Tatsumi Kimishima said fewer and fewer young people are finding out about Nintendo games through... games. Instead, they're discovering Nintendo and its characters through things like <a href="http://www.armandhammer.com/personal-care/kids-toothbrushes/Products/spinbrush-mario.aspx" rel="nofollow ">officially licensed Mario toothbrushes</a>. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-mario-toothbrushes-and-other-licensing-de/1100-6434624/" data-ref-id="1100-6434624">said in 2016</a> that people can expect these kinds of licensing deals to continue and possibly increase, and indeed they have.</p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in 2023, is perhaps Nintendo's biggest non-gaming success story so far--it brought in more than $1.3 billion at the box office. It is one of the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 20 highest-grossing movies in history</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 1 video game movie of all time</a>. Multiple more Nintendo movies are on the way, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Zelda film</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-gets-exciting-update-about-its-characters-and-world/1100-6526856/" data-ref-id="1100-6526856">The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2.</a></p><p>Then there is the Super Nintendo World theme park attraction, which expands in a big way this May when it opens at Universal Studios in Orlando. And anyone who's been to a grocery store or a department store knows full well how many licensed Nintendo toys there are.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, the new console launches later this year. Nintendo will share more details about the system during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct in April. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Those waiting for the Black Hawk Down campaign for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a>, the modern free-to-play revival of the classic FPS series, won't have to wait much longer. Developer Team Jade, a subsidiary of Chinese gaming giant Tencent, announced the paid DLC will launch February 21.</p><p dir="ltr">Delta Force's upcoming Black Hawk Down campaign is a remake of the 2003 shooter of the same name, it in turn based on a book documenting the real events involving a US military task force during the Somali Civil War in 1993. Team Jade released a brief teaser trailer alongside the release date to give fans an idea of what to expect, showing battles through the destroyed streets of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnHhjWNxds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pXnHhjWNxds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Black Hawk Down campaign for Delta Force was originally slated to arrive in January, so its new February release date is actually a delay. As for how much the campaign will cost, Team Jade has not officially said just yet. Team Jade states in the description for the campaign's launch teaser trailer that more details will be coming in the following days. In a development diary Q&amp;A from last year, Team Jade said the campaign DLC will not feature microtransactions and can be played co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force-black-hawk-down/" data-ref-id="5000-4624">Delta Force: Black Hawk Down</a> was the sixth game in developer NovaLogic's Delta Force tactical FPS series, and released on PC in 2003 before being ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't interesting in checking out Delta Force's campaign, its free-to-play multiplayer offerings have been regularly updated in the weeks following its December 2024 release. The game has drawn comparisons to EA's Battlefield series for the large player counts and vehicle gameplay seen in its Warfare game mode, but additionally includes an extraction-style mode and a 3v3v3 squad-focused game type called Hot Zone. Though Delta Force is currently only available on PC, it is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile sometime this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Battlefield, EA recently gave fans a first-look at gameplay for the next entry in the series alongside announcing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">community testing program called Battlefield Labs</a> intended to help it avoid some of the pitfalls of Battlefield 2042.</p>

It was previously expected to end at the same time on February 10.</p><p>This double XP period covers double XP for player progression, weapons, and Gobblegum earn rate.

We’re actively gathering that data, but we also know that there’s no better feedback than yours--the passionate PvZ community," EA said in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>.</p><p>EA showed three images of the same plant punching a zombie but in three different art styles and is asking fans to share their thoughts on social media with the hashtag #PvZ3 and which one they prefer. The first one is a slightly 3D cel-shaded art direction compared to the second one. However, the third one is much more dynamic, looking like a comic-book panel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441396" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441396"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441393,1300-4441394,1300-4441395" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png"></figure><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 was first announced in 2019 and soft-launched in various regions over the past few years such as Australia and the Philippines.

                <p>The Order: 1886 developer Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel to Sony but was ultimately rejected. While the reason was unclear, the developer thought that had the game's critical reception been higher, there would've been a better chance.</p><p>"We really thought that with The Order, we had set up such a unique and appealing baseline that people were going to forgive some of its shortcomings," Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with MinnMax</a>. "It would've been an incredible sequel, I can tell you for a fact."</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/" data-ref-id="1900-6416033">The Order 1886's lukewarm critical reception</a>, sitting at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-order-1886/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel. Pessino explained that it was actually better that Sony passed on the sequel because the budget would've been small and the studio didn't have any leverage to negotiate a better contract. However, Pessino said that the team would've taken the opportunity anyway in order to redeem The Order: 1886.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFmUHo_pJJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pessnio didn't divulge any details about where the sequel would take place, as the IP belongs to Sony and not Ready at Dawn. One of the problems during the development of The Order: 1886 was the pressure to ship so content was cut--interactive elements became cutscenes and movies. "We were desperate, you know, we had to ship," he said. "We need at least one more year and we didn't get it."</p><p>Pessino didn't reveal how much The Order: 1886 sold, but thought Sony's rejection was based on critical reception rather than sales numbers. Interestingly, he said that internal mock reviews placed the game's score at around the 70s range, yet when the game was released, the critical reception ended up being lower. Had it actually scored somewhere in the 70s, then Pessino was convinced there could've been a sequel.</p><p>A sequel to The Order 1886 isn't the only one that Sony passed on. Last week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resistance-4-was-pitched-but-didnt-work-out-says-former-boss/1100-6529337/" data-ref-id="1100-6529337">Sony passed on Resistance 4</a> when it was pitched as well. Ready at Dawn was acquired by Meta in 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/" data-ref-id="1100-6525619">was shut down last August</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/six-roblox-horror-games-to-try-out-this-halloween/2900-4416/" data-ref-id="2900-4416">Roblox</a> is one of the most popular gaming platforms, but there may be trouble ahead. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that Roblox is "part of an active and ongoing investigation."</p><p><a href="https://hntrbrk.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunterberg Media</a> originally reported last fall that Roblox was under investigation by the SEC over charges that it "inflated key metrics" for investors on Wall Street and for its lax safety measures regarding potential child predators on the platform. The SEC did not confirm that Roblox's parent company, The Roblox Corporation, is under investigation. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed that the SEC refused to provide details of its investigation because it may "harm... the ongoing enforcement proceeding."</p><p>In November 2024, The Roblox Corporation laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">new safety guidelines for children</a> on the platform. Children under the age of 13 are no longer allowed access to unrated experiences created within Roblox, and only children 13 and older will be allowed to utilize the social hangouts and free-form user-creation experiences. That move came after a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> story which noted that The Roblox Company reported over 13,000 instances of child exploitation to authorities in 2023. Moreover, two dozen people were arrested for abusing children after making contact with them through the platform.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to that report</a> by touting its cooperation with law enforcement to combat illegal activity on the platform. It also suggested that Bloomberg's report didn't contextualize the scale of the child exploitation problem with Roblox's large user base.</p><p>During last year's Roblox Developers Conference, The Roblox Corporation reiterated its plans to reach <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. If it's proven that The Roblox inflated its current estimate of daily Roblox users to investors, that could potentially lead to severe penalties from the SEC.</p>

Grandmaster rank and above that will have a unique design each season. NetEase said players will need to complete 10 matches in competitive mode in order to claim the rewards for any given season.</p><p dir="ltr">What balance changes are in store for Marvel Rivals is still under wraps, but NetEase did confirm that the Human Torch and The Thing will be making their debut alongside the mid-season update. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>.

With the additions of the two heroes, the entire Fantastic Four will be playable in Marvel Rivals, with NetEase having added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-invisible-woman-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-unseen-force/2300-6465576/" data-ref-id="2300-6465576">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-mister-fantastic-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-stretching-into-action/2300-6465572/" data-ref-id="2300-6465572">Mr. Fantastic</a> at the beginning of Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase has already said players can expect new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-characters-will-release-much-more-often-than-you-might-expect/1100-6528797/" data-ref-id="1100-6528797">two new playable characters every season</a>--one at the beginning and another at the season's mid-point, with each Marvel Rivals seasons lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-update-is-full-of-buffs-and-nerfs-for-each-role-full-patch-notes/1100-6528702/" data-ref-id="1100-6528702">first major balance changes for Marvel Rivals as part of Season 1</a> nerfed some of its most popular damage-dealing Duelist characters while buffing many of the game's powerful Strategist (aka support) heroes.
