                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

At Borderlands Fan Fest, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford and chief creative officer Randy Varnell were on stage to reveal more details about the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-shows-off-the-sinister-timekeeper-and-claptrap/1100-6532590/">following the debut of a new story trailer</a> that put the spotlight on the sinister Timekeeper.</p><p>"You'll find more skills per character than in Borderlands 3 and 2 added together, it's a lot of complexity and depth per character," Pitchford said. "We're working late on Fridays for you," he added.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Varnell, the skill trees are so varied that players could take the same character and action skill into a fight and still be able to fulfill different roles in a firefight. This is a big departure from Borderlands 3, where action skills were generally tied to certain playstyles and didn't offer much room for improvisation.</p><p>As for the overall numbers, players could be looking at a very in-depth system for all the skills they can play around with. For example, Borderlands 2 had up to 10 skills per skill tree for each character, while Borderlands 3 offered four skill trees and up to 20 skills for each one across various tiers. A lot of these skills focused on buffing characters when certain actions were performed, with reduced ability cooldowns, rapid healing, and action-skill enhancements being offered for the right build.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with the standard version of the game priced at $70. A Switch 2 version is also coming at a later date.</p><p>"This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p>

                <p>Deltarune Chapter 5 is set to be released sometime in 2026, according to a message at the end of Chapter 4.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-will-release-in-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by IGN</a>, beating Deltarune Chapter 4 grants players with a message that reads, "To be continued in Chapter 5. 2026."

                <p>Shadow Labyrinth is an enigma.</p><p>It should be simple enough to describe: It's a "2D action exploration &amp; combat platformer," or "2DAECP"--which is Bandai's Namco official description and its way of saying "metroidvania" without mentioning a word made by combining two rival games' names--in which a mysterious amnesiac follows a small yellow robot through a labyrinth of tough battles and tight platforming. Like other games in the genre, the path here is well-trodden; there's side-scrolling exploration across a big map that opens as you unlock new abilities, and lots of enemies to fight along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shadow Labyrinth Maze Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>What you won't expect, however, is the story Bandai Namco is telling around the Metroi--sorry, 2DAECP--it has devised. It's known that this game directly ties into the Pac-Man-themed episode of Amazon Prime's animated Secret Level series, but it's the rest of the lore that turned my head during a recent virtual preview session. The 2DAECP space is crowded right now, but Bandai Namco may have found a way to rise above the rest with Shadow Labyrinth; you'll just have to brush up on your gaming history.</p><p>Before that, though, let's dig into the meat of what you're going to be doing in the game. My preview gave me access to a portion of combat and platforming challenges, with two boss fights waiting for me at the end. I began, naturally, with the exploration section, which dropped me into an area known as the Land of the Fugitives.</p><p>The core gameplay on offer here in Shadow Labyrinth is standard 2DAECP fare; I had multiple paths to explore, each with their own trials and tribulations, until I found what I was looking for and headed back to where I began. The demo gave me three different branches, each holding the piece to a key I needed to advance, but each also centered on one of three unique challenges: combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving.</p><p>The combat trial was a gauntlet of weird large-headed enemies wielding knives and swords. Shadow Labyrinth's combat is easy to pick up--one button delivers quick sword strikes, the other a more powerful move that briefly depletes a stamina bar--but far from simple to master. These enemies are devious, with some trapping me in a corner and whipping me to death, while others would aim to shoot not where I was standing, but where they predicted I would be; they were about 50/50 in that regard. I found the trial challenging without being frustrating, and it felt great to get through the final wave and get the key piece.</p><p>The environmental puzzle, while fine, didn't leave as much of an impression on me, but the platforming was the most challenging and rewarding part of the whole demo. It feels like the developers put a ton of thought into trying to predict how players would approach each level, and then they designed their obstacles around that, rather than just placing enemies and traps on each stage. This meant I had to strategize, think before moving, and approach each dangerous obstacle with care; the game actively punishes mindless traversal, and that's how a game like this should be.</p><p>I also enjoyed the "D-Line" parts of the stage--or when my traversal turned into a small game of Pac-Man, and I had to travel on lines of light in order to proceed. These provided a welcome shot of variety during exploration, with a chaser of nostalgia for classic Pac-Man gameplay to boot.</p><p>Nostalgia is at the heart of Shadow Labyrinth, and it's here that I'll now address the absolutely bonkers story framing all of the exploration and fighting. As the Amazon Prime show established, the small yellow robot named Puck is trying to escape the world it's trapped in, and he must recruit warriors to do so. I play as Swordsman No. 8, the eighth attempt at escape and victory, and together we explored and fought our way through.</p><p>That's only scratching the surface, though, as there are layers to this tale that I never expected. For example, were you aware, dear reader, that every classic sci-fi game Bandai Namco ever made was part of a <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/" rel="nofollow ">single canonical timeline</a>? Before this preview event, I knew nothing of it, but Bandai Namco claims it has always operated on this timeline in secret--the veracity of this claim is up for debate, but damn if it isn't interesting either way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133"></a><figcaption>Meeting the Bosconians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg"></figure><p>As Shadow Labyrinth sits toward the end of this potentially-decades-old story, it is filled with references and allusions to games that came before it. A few examples:</p><ul><li>The tribe of friendly human characters I encountered are called the Bosconians.</li><li>The queen refers to my character, whose identity is still a mystery at this point, as a Galaxian.</li><li>She also references a potential foe named Emperor Galaga.</li><li>The Pac-Man robot's name, Puck, is a reference to Puck-Man, which was Pac-Man's original name.</li><li>Enemies encountered during the demo included Pookas and Fygars from Dig Dug.</li></ul><p>These are the less overt examples that some may not pick up on, while other references are much more obvious. I fought two different bosses during this demo, one at the end of the exploration part and the second from the specific save file provided by Bandai Namco. Both of them directly referenced a previous Bandai Namco project; first up was G-HOST, a small pink ghost-looking creature stuck to a machine controlling massive hooks that crashed on top of me. Pac-Man is pretty important to the lore, of course, so it's not surprising to see one of his ghostly enemies appear here.</p><p>The other boss, meanwhile, blew the "self-referential" concept wide open. This was a hulking beast of a humanoid monster wearing a distinct Jason Voorhess-esque white mask and named Jen. If your horror bells are ringing, that's because Jen was the damsel-in-distress of the Splatterhouse franchise, and her hero, Rick Taylor, wore a distinct Jason Voorhees-esque white mask as he tore demons and humanoid monsters in twain. Splatterhouse doesn't appear on the timeline I shared earlier, so how deep into the Bandai Namco vault is Shadow Labyrinth planning to go?</p><p>There is no shortage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/">metroidvania games</a> out there at the moment--and there are more coming with both Hollow Knight: Silksong and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch new entries this year. How, then, can a game enter this crowded space and stand out? Bandai Namco may have cracked the code with Shadow Labyrinth: Make the story so incredibly wild that it can't be missed. It helps that the 2DAECP surrounding this bonkers tale is fun and challenging, so you'll be encouraged to keep traveling deeper down this Pac-rabbit hole.</p><p>I didn't know what to expect when dropping into Shadow Labyrinth for this preview event. After my time playing, I still don't know what's coming, and the game is all the more appealing for it.</p>
