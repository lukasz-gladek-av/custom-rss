                <p dir="ltr">One of the 2025 Xbox Showcase's most shocking reveals was Invincible VS, a new three-on-three tag fighter from Skybound and a new startup studio called Quarter Up Games. Don't let the "new startup" descriptor fool you, however; this is a team steeped in fighting game experience, as it was responsible for bringing back a cult classic to a legion of appreciative fans over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, Quarter Up and Skybound are set on breathing new life not into just a franchise, but a concept--Invincible VS invokes the highly-praised Marvel vs. Capcom style of 2D fighting games that use a tag-team system to swap between multiple characters, which is a tall task to try replicating. Based on our hands-on gameplay during a recent visit to Skybound in Los Angeles, it seems that Quarter Up is well on its way to answering the call.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS | Official Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A Killer origin story</h2><p dir="ltr">In 2013, developer Double Helix brought Rare's Killer Instinct series back to the masses on Xbox One. The 2013 installment's gritty, impactful fighting system made it an instant fan favorite, but soon after it launched, the studio was snapped up by Amazon Games. Many of KI 2013's key developers went on to other projects, but Mike Willette--KI 2013 producer and the voice behind the iconic "c-c-c-combo breaker!" sound effect in the reboot--wasn't done with fighting games yet. He wanted to get the band back together.</p><p dir="ltr">"We felt like we had unfinished business," Willette told GameSpot on a recent Zoom call. "I still had that itch, so after working [as lead of the world design team] on New World [at Amazon], I reached out to a whole bunch of the oldheads and said, 'Look, I'm thinking about starting a studio. Would you guys be interested?' Immediately, a bunch of them were in. 'Yeah dude, I had so much fun. We love the people, we love the community. If you can make it happen, Mike, we'll show up.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Not long after, Willette found himself in the offices of Skybound, creators of the dark and gritty Invincible superhero franchise. "Skybound asks me, 'Mike, what game would you want to build here?' and I immediately said, 'I want to build an Invincible fighting game, and I'll build a tag fighting game,'" Willette recalled. "I was a huge fan of the show and the comics, and there's just so much rich material there. It's violent. It's brutal. It has the stakes of what happens with superheroes. I just connected with them on such a level that I said, 'This is it, this is what I want to do.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Making a three-on-three tag fighter was a no-brainer for the team, as Invincible's pantheon of superheroes, according to Willette, lends itself perfectly to that style of fighting game. Tag battle fighting games are hype. They're incredible," Willette said. "The amount of creativity, the combo systems, the different archetypes that let you build your own team, instead of just using a single character... There hadn't been a real big game since Dragon Ball FighterZ, either, so we carried over from our days in KI, plus all the learnings from the past 10 years, and that's the genesis of Quarter Up."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856" data-ratio="0.56238603803074" data-width="3839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856"></a><figcaption>Invincible VS</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510857,1300-4510858,1300-4510859,1300-4510860,1300-4510861" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Invincible</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS employs a simplified version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3's four-button control scheme for attacks: There are four attack buttons--light, medium, heavy, and special--and each has multiple special attacks that are used depending on which direction you move the left thumbstick, a la Super Smash Bros. Tapping the light attack multiple times also offers an auto-combo that will chain into a super move, should the aggressor have the meter to use it.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, the team has balanced that simplified control scheme with a system that offers plenty of depth and advanced tactics to discover. Those worried about players mashing the combo button over and over again, for example, can take solace in the return of one of Killer Instinct's defining features: the combo meter, which will force a player to drop a combo if they use the same move too often.</p><p dir="ltr">Core fighting mechanics resemble those from other fighting games: Heroic Boost adds extra power or hits to special attacks similar to EX moves in Street Fighter, super meters allow for more powerful moves as you charge them up by attacking and blocking, and so on. Some are adapted in new and interesting ways, however: "snapback"--moves that force an opponent to swap characters--can also blast an opponent into an entirely different stage in Invincible VS. In doing so, the character getting knocked into a new stage will lose access to their assist characters for a brief moment--because, from a storytelling perspective, those characters have to "catch up," while the offensive team is ready to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Incorporating the Invincible franchise into this format, meanwhile, has been incredibly easy for Willette and his team--easier than his previous projects, in fact.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compared to Killer Instinct's historical files, I have a lot more access with this property," Willette explained. "The problem when we worked on KI was that all of the previous developers were gone; we did have [Xbox partner creative director] Ken Lobb, and I could always go to Ken, but here I can go right to the well, and it's a <em>deep</em> well."</p><p dir="ltr">This comes through in the pre-fight character intros, where every character pairing in the game will have unique dialogue with every other character--even if they've never interacted in official Invincible media.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got access to decades worth of comic references, access to the show team," Willette said, "and we're always spitballing ideas back and forth with each other. It's very cool to work here."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle scars</h2><p dir="ltr">That authenticity also bears a more grisly side through Invincible VS' blood-and-gore factor, a trait not normally associated with tag fighters like this. The most obvious implementation of this is in Overkills, where certain special and super moves will decapitate, dismember, or even detonate an opponent's body into pieces if used as the final hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Willette says this level of violence was necessary to convey what Invincible has always been about, but there is a limit.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to be brutal, but not hyper-grotesque for shock value," he explained. "We want to show the sheer brutality of these superheroes fighting, like the ground getting torn up or costumes getting ripped and splattered with blood. If you did a killing blow, it's really important for us, especially to be authentic to the [intellectual property]."</p><p dir="ltr">Willette also reveals that the team has put a unique spin on the battle damage concept through "offensive" and "defensive" versions of it. If one character has a big lead over another, the leading character will still have blood spots on their costumes or fists caked in red--it's just the <em>other</em> character's blood rather than their own.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are really conscious of how these things would affect both fighters," Willette said. "If a character is at low health, for another example, their idle animation will be different to show how tired they are. They're saying, 'All right, I'm messed up, but I'll keep going.' We really wanted to have those as part of the storytelling of the fight action."</p><p dir="ltr">The team at Quarter Up Games wants Invincible VS to appeal to as many players as possible, and it hopes to achieve it through one simple approach: Make each player feel like an absolute badass.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you pick up that game pad for the first time and you can just mash and you feel awesome, that's great. That means you're going to stick around longer," Willette said. "If you've never played a fighting game before, I'd love for this to be your first fighting game. And if lapsed, we'd love for you to come back for this because we love fighting games. We want to make you fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is a love letter from us saying, 'Yeah, we love Invincible, we love fighting games and we want you to come play.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set for launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p> There were more souls-likes than I could muster the interest in at Summer Game Fest 2025. I've never been one to enjoy the genre in most cases anyway, and seeing how many games were leaning into gameplay loops of dodge-roll showdowns with gigantic, spongey bosses had me checked out at times during the various showcases over the past week. But I played one game that borrows from the genre and didn't turn me away. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/end-of-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-681505">End of Abyss</a> takes a few touchstones from games like Dark Souls, ties it in with a Little-Nightmares-in-space aesthetic, and brings it all together in a cleverly creepy twin-stick shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">End of Abyss comes from Section 9 Interactive, a new studio created in part by former Tarsier Studio developers, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel. The Little Nightmares influence can definitely be felt in End of Abyss. Though the enemy and world design are much different, trading the stuff of childhood night terrors for coldly blue-tinted isolation akin to a sci-fi horror story, there's something about it that feels familiar. Maybe it's the nameless, voiceless character being chased by fleshy monsters. Or maybe it's their brightly colored jacket--here a lime green as opposed to Little Nightmare's yellow raincoat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eot8qV7CuTA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eot8qV7CuTA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, the protagonist in End of Abyss can defend themselves, unlike those in Tarsier's games. Using a pistol with unlimited ammo, or other found weapons like a shotgun I discovered in my play session, the game's twin-stick shooting felt well-implemented. It wasn't very sticky, which I liked, as it gave it an anxiety-inducing effect. Missing shots meant the enemies were able to close the distance and caused me to dodge them, either out of the room so I could create a bottleneck in a doorway, or just catch my breath. Some enemies grew long, giraffe-like necks, which they swung at me with sneakily far reach. Others came in packs of several small bugs that would jump on me, causing me to shake them off and book it, or try to knife them on their approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The souls-like inspirations can be felt in a few ways some players will be familiar with. For one, the map feels circular in that satisfying way From Software and its lineage utilize a lot. Exploring every space felt key, as it allowed me to find hidden caches of weapon or suit upgrade materials, but just as important, I could unlock passageways that helped me loop back around to earlier areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the enemies respawn when you save at a mysterious type of pod--not to be confused with a traditional bonfire--these shortcuts helped evade the same sequence of enemies each time I came back to the area to save or upgrade my character. There are no corpse runs, but the game will punish you for failing to save manually, so these shortcuts back to a safe haven will be vital for survival.</p><p dir="ltr">I got to take on a huge boss monster too, which, despite its sizeable health bar, didn't prove too tricky given my abundance of shotgun ammo I'd crafted by then, but I expect this was a kindness afforded to me in the demo only, and in the full game, I'd have to scramble a bit more. The boss battle felt soulsy too, where each hit devastated me, so I could only afford to mess up very few times. I'm hoping the game can strike a nice balance between being challenging yet not brutal, and co-creator Mattias Ottvall told me that's the team's vision as well.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played so far, the game's best attribute is its atmosphere. There is a chilling stillness to the world. Enemies often stand around, or even seem to lie in wait, until you approach them, sometimes sneak-attacking from behind a doorway or out of a shadow. This leaves you alone much of the time, unsure of what's around each corner. Your scanner device, which can locate secret caches or puzzle areas, echoes through the ghostly halls of the alien world. I suspect the game won't care to answer many questions about where and when the game takes place, and I'm perfectly happy to go along for that ride into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly a horror game, Ottvall told me, but the game has inched closer to that identity during development because its small team featured mostly artwork-focused developers. The mechanics of the game naturally shifted to adapt to the art-driven game. That was an interesting wrinkle for me to learn, as it suggests that the game may have looked quite different if the balance between gameplay designers and world designers was skewed the other way. Instead, we got the icy-blue End of Abyss you can see in the trailer above, which is definitely more up my alley than a demanding combat-first game the devs may have once been targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who loves Little Nightmares, enjoys twin-stick shooters, and doesn't care for souls-likes, I feel what I saw so far is enough of those first two elements to allow me not to get frustrated by its third element. End of Abyss seems to be the start of an intriguing new studio. It's coming to Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.</p>

                <p>Funcom's Dune: Awakening is finally out on PC, but you might be wondering if it's also headed to consoles. Now that the game has launched on PC, Funcom re-affirmed that Awakening is, indeed, headed to console platforms, but not until 2026.</p><p>There is no specific 2026 release date, however, nor is there a set of confirmed console platforms, but Xbox and PlayStation systems seem like a safe bet. Whether or not Switch 2 may be in the mix, too, is unknown.</p><p>Awakening blasted off on Steam to big results, as the $50 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently the No. 1 best-selling game</a> and is inside Steam's top 10 most-played games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clocking more than 135,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>Funcom highlighted the fact that Awakening is available on PC as part of a "classic business model" where you "buy once and own it." This is the full 1.0 launch, not early access, and there are no subscription fees or microtransactions.</p><p>There is a $25 season pass that includes a range of content, including the sandworm, hiroptera, kulon, and Muad'Dib creatures, which are available now. The three other DLC packs in the season pass are coming later this year and in 2026.</p><p>Awakening is a multiplayer survival game set on the planet of Arrakis, based on the work of author Frank Herbert and most recently brought to life in the Dune films from Denis Villeneuve. Players can choose to align with Atreides or Harkonnen and then take part in missions that "influence the shared world."</p><p>As for the movie series, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/denis-villeneuve-dune-3-plans-1236119697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Villeneuve is coming back to make a third Dune movie.</a></p>

Until now, only the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless supported this feature, making the Nova 3 Wireless an alternative--and even more affordable--choice compared to the $130 Nova 5 line.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is available in two models: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3P Wireless</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3X Wireless</a>. The Nova 3P Wireless supports PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices, while the 3X is compatible with Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. The headsets can connect to up to two devices at the same time--one via the included 2.4Ghz wireless dongle and the other via Bluetooth. However, like the Arctis Nova 5, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless does not support simultaneous playback from both devices. Instead, you can swap between the two connections on the fly. That said, by connecting to your mobile device via Bluetooth, you can modify the headset's selected EQ preset in the Arctis mobile app, even while listening to your console or PC over 2.4Ghz.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond slightly different platform compatibilities, the Nova 3X Wireless and Nova 3P Wireless are otherwise identical. They both sport the same lightweight design and flexible headbands as other Arctis Nova headsets, and feature detachable microphones, custom-tuned neodymium magnetic drivers, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. They also support fast-charging, which can recharge up to nine hours of battery after just 15 minutes. Both are available for $110.</p></div>                      </div><p>We haven't tested the Arctis Nova 3, but several other Arctis models landed on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best gaming headsets</a>, including the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, so we’re optimistic about the Nova 3's performance. There are plenty of other fantastic SteelSeries headsets to check out, including the budget-friendly wired Arctis Nova 1. Its audio quality and wired connection aren’t ideal for all situations, but it’s hard to beat its low price.</p><p>We've compiled a list of all the headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line below. Most of these headsets are available in a variety of models, and those with the “X” classification add Xbox support along with support for platforms like PS5, Switch, and PC.
