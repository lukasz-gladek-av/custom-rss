                <p>Back in the '90s, there were several animated adaptations of popular video games, and two of them are headed to Blu-ray soon. Discotek has officially announced that the Street Fighter and Darkstalker TV series will be getting the Blu-ray treatment, which includes brand-new cover art and a surprising amount of extra content.</p><p>Just to be clear, these shows are products of a time when animated series followed a set of family-friendly guidelines. Violence was naturally toned down since the shows were aimed at younger audiences, and the storylines mixed references to the games with plots that were designed to get you to buy licensed action figures. Still, there's a certain charm to these classic cartoons, and Discotek is packing quite a few extras on each release.</p><p>Street Fighter: The Animated Series is a wonderfully weird adaptation, as it revolves around Guile leading an international task force of martial artists against M Bison and his Shadaloo syndicate. Yes, it's basically GI Joe but with more sonic booms and hadoukens. For the Blu-ray release, all 26 episodes have been included, you can view the original intro for the show in storyboard mode, an art gallery has been included, and there are game-inspired menus.</p><p>All 26 episodes come with commentary tracks narrated by notable members of the fighting game and YouTube community, like Matt McMuscles, Maximillian Dood, Justin Wong, Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson, Alexs Le, Lythero, and Guile Win Quote. Interestingly, the cartoon is a sequel to the iconic live-action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia, and if you're looking to get that film, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B09HFXX64T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">really nice steelbook version</a> was released not too long ago. It even comes with 100 Bison Dollars, which will be worth quite a few British Pounds once the King of England has been kidnapped and new exchange rates have been set.</p><p>Alternatively, you can pick up the recent 4K release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGWQSMJY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie</a>. This is a 4K HDR transfer of the original cut of the film, and both the uncensored and PG-13 versions are included. For the extras, you're getting the original Japanese and English dubs, production art, promotional materials, and several other extras.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4430517" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4430517"></a><figcaption>The Street Fighter 1994 movie, considered by many to be the Citizen Kane of video game movies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4430517-street-fighter-1994.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B09HFXX64T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter: The Movie (Steelbook Edition)</a> -- $24.96 ($<del>35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Extreme-Blu-ray-Jean-Claude/dp/B001L2ZSJE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter: The Movie (Standard Blu-ray)</a> -- $10 ($<del>15</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGWQSMJY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie</a> (4K Blu-ray) -- $27.49 ($<del>35</del>)</li></ul><p>Darkstalkers only got a single 13-episode season, and it was a major departure from its source material. Loosely based on the first Darkstalkers game, the TV series was aimed at a younger audience and had a much more lighthearted tone in comparison. It also had animation that varied wildly in quality, nonsensical plots, and hilariously bad voice acting.</p><p>If you're looking for something that is so bad that it goes full circle and actually becomes good, then this time capsule of Saturday-morning-cartoon energy might appeal to you. Extras haven't been confirmed for the Blu-ray yet, but if the Street Fighter release is any indication, then you can count on Discotek to unearth some interesting archival material for this release.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>One of the first executive orders that President Trump discussed on Monday after his inauguration was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-energy-economy-inflation-ev-oil-gas-00be8d3d5216a328e129666032c889e1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new 25% tariff for Mexico and Canada that is expected to become effective February 1</a>. A good amount of production infrastructure for video game discs happens in Mexico, so what's the effect going to be for the end consumer? No one knows yet. And who knows if the order will even happen. But Circana analyst Mat Piscatella has now shared his thoughts on how the new tariffs could impact people who play video games, and he's expecting higher prices overall.</p><p>Posting on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Piscatella said he expects to see a "sharp downtick" in the number of disc-based games that are released in the US, given that "much of that production infrastructure" is in Mexico. If companies still go ahead with making discs, then consumers can expect higher prices, he said. And not just for physical discs. Piscatella said he expects digital game prices to go up as well.</p><p>A digital game has no disc, of course, but companies may want to retain price parity all the same between physical and digital in the event of tariff-driven price increases, Piscatella said. He added that he doesn't know how this will all actually shake out and is only theorizing for now. However, he said, "None of this is good for the physical video game market."</p><p>Piscatella added that US-based video game companies could shift production out of Mexico and into the US, but not without "significant investment." That's probably not going to happen, in part because spending on physical games in the US is already half of what it was in 2021 and continues to decline "rapidly," Piscatella said.</p><p>Trump has also suggested he could implement a 60% tariff on goods from China, which could have significant ramifications on video games and video game hardware. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">many question if that's even feasible or likely to happen</a>.</p><p>Beyond video game price increases tied to potential tariffs, some in the video game business are wondering if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 could trigger a new industry-wide price increase on the MSRP for games, potentially up to $80 or above.</a> The most recent price increase from $60 to $70 was <a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881071892557410389" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">embraced without issue</a>, experts say, and another increase could follow.</p>

                <p>After Marvel Snap was unexpectedly taken offline in the US due to the TikTok ban, developer Second Dinner has announced that the game is back online, and is taking steps to avoid future situations like this.</p><p>"Marvel Snap is back online in the US, but to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for Marvel Snap," Second Dinner explained on Twitter.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.

Due to the issue, players have been missing out on time-based content such as daily login rewards and missions. Second Dinner has already committed to making sure players that have been affected will be compensated, but the details have not been revealed yet.</p><p>Furthermore, the game was also removed from app stores, and Second Dinner is working on getting it restored. While in-app purchases remain unavailable, web-shop purchases are still working, and the team is looking to fix the issue.</p><p>When TikTok briefly went offline on January 19, so did Marvel Snap, due to its publisher, Nuverse, being a part of TikTok parent company Bytedance (although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-publisher-suffers-layoffs-could-shut-down-report/1100-6519484/" data-ref-id="1100-6519484">Nuverse had already divested from Bytedance</a>). However, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/tiktok-future-donald-trump-ban-sale/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed an executive action that delayed TikTok's ban for 75 days</a>. Second Dinner is presumably looking for a new publisher in the meantime so Marvel Snap isn't at risk of being banned again in case the TikTok ban delay expires.</p>

                <p>Activision has released a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gargantuan blog post</a> in which it responded to fans' ongoing concerns and criticisms about the state of Call of Duty, and one section confirms that the developer will temporarily scale back its content plans for Warzone as it aims to improve the game first.</p><p>In the blog post, Activision said it has made the decision to "prioritize focus on gameplay tuning, adding more quality of life, and addressing ongoing bugs." Because of this shift in focus, Activision said some of the new content originally planned for Season 2 "has been shifted to create bandwidth to address foundational issues." Activision did not specify what Season 2 content is being delayed, however.</p><p>Activision said it has numerous updates in the works for Warzone that aim to create the "most solid foundation" for the game. These updates will be released over time, and include gameplay adjustments such as reload speeds up to 20% faster for every weapon in the game. Activision is also reducing the penalty for sprint-to-fire from 35% to 10% and increasing the jump ADS speeds by 25%.</p><p>Additionally, the parachute cut animation has been increased so players can transition from cutting the parachute to getting into the action "significantly faster." Other updates include advanced UAVs now showing elevation arrows and the Spy Camera outline effect no longer rendering through walls.</p><p>Warzone is getting lots of bug fixes, too, including all of these listed below.</p><ul><li><h4>Map &amp; Gameplay Issues</h4><ul><li>Addressed visibility of dark areas and characters on Rebirth Island.</li><li>Addressed players being forced to stand up while reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed exploits allowing players to access unintended areas of the map.</li><li>Addressed parachutes deploying when jumping off ladders.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h4><ul><li>Addressed weapons becoming inaccessible near interactable areas.</li><li>Addressed weapons falling through Buy Station models.</li><li>Addressed weapon tooltips appearing as common when dropped to the ground.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Perks &amp; Contracts</h4><ul><li>Addressed Ghost persisting through the prematch lobby into the match.</li><li>Addressed Cold Blooded not properly countering Tracker.</li><li>Addressed Quick Fix health regen not properly activating while plating.</li><li>Addressed Survivor preventing players from reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed Most Wanted contracts not overriding respawn timers as intended.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Operators</h4><ul><li>Addressed Operator selection appearance issues in menu.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Finally, Activision said some of the issues with Warzone that players have reported in recent weeks may have to do with the integration of Black Ops 6's content into the game.</p><p>"We want to take a moment to reflect on the significance of Black Ops 6's integration--the largest in Call of Duty history--which, for the first time, has brought our teams and products together into a unified development environment," Activision said. "While this transformation has presented its share of obstacles, it also paves the way for more ambitious updates and closer collaboration in the future. We’re essentially laying a foundation to make new technology immediately available to all of our studios, improving development pipelines and the stability of porting features between titles, and allowing us to focus more of our time on future releases."</p><p>As for Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Activision is making some welcome changes as well, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-finally-let-players-disable-cross-play-for-ranked-play/1100-6528900/" data-ref-id="1100-6528900">finally allowing players to disable cross-play in Ranked matches. </a></p>

                <p>A recent rating on the ESRB website could point to a fresh release of Resident Evil 6 on modern consoles, potentially bringing the polarizing survival-action-horror game to new audiences.</p><p>As seen on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40367/resident-evil-6/" rel="nofollow ">ratings section of the website</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-esrb-rating-suggests-a-classic-resident-evil-is-getting-an-xbox-series-and-ps5-re-release/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/" data-ref-id="5000-82753">Resident Evil 6</a> has received an "M" classification for "Xbox Series" consoles, hinting at the game possibly heading to that console.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-456-coming-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6435096/">as PS4 and Xbox One versions of Resident Evil 6 were released back in 2016</a>. The re-release came with all previously released add-on content, and in 2019, a Nintendo Switch version of the game was also released.</p><p>Resident Evil 6 is seen as the black sheep of the mainline franchise, as its attempt to be both a survival-horror and a survival-action game were met with mixed reception when it was first released in 2012. An over-reliance on distracting quick-time events and poorly executed scripted events did not sit well with audiences at the time, and over a decade later, the game still isn't fondly remembered.</p><p>Fortunately, Capcom's back-to-basics approach with the next mainline Resident Evil game helped kick off a new golden age for the franchise. Resident Evil 7 is still one of the scariest games in the series, while the remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 were praised for bringing the classic games into the modern era.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">The Resident Evil 4 remake earned a rare perfect score</a> at GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/">and Resident Evil Village received a highly positive reception</a> upon release.</p>

                <p>Epic's battle royale game Fortnite has introduced numerous licensed characters over the years, and the latest could be the classic Fox character Hank Hill from the animated series King of the Hill.</p><p>FNBRintel was first to report about the Fortnite X King of the Hill crossover that is said to be in the works, though a partnership has not been officially announced as of yet. King of the Hill was a popular show through its run in the late '90s and 2000s, and a revival of the show is coming to Hulu as soon as this year. As such, it makes a lot of sense that Hank could come to Fortnite in a cross-promotional effort.</p><p>Hank wouldn't be the first big Fox animated character to come to Fortnite, as Peter Griffin from Family Guy--the muscly version of the character, at least--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-peter-griffin-fortnite-leak-has-fans-thrilled/1100-6519637/" data-ref-id="1100-6519637">added to Fortnite in 2023.</a> Fox's most popular animated show, The Simpsons, hasn't had a Fortnite crossover as of yet.</p><p>Hank, voiced by Mike Judge, is the main protagonist of King of the Hill, which Judge created. Hank is a big fan of <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Strickland_Propane" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">propane and propane accessories</a> and <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Alamo_Beer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drinking Alamo beer with his friends.</a> He's a non-combative and subdued man, so it'll be interesting to see how he plays in Fortnite, if he is indeed coming.</p><p>Fortnite's latest crossover character is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">Godzilla, who is now in the game.</a> For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">everything you need to know about Godzilla in Fortnite.</a></p>
