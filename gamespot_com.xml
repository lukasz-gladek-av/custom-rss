                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-arc-abilities-revealed-for-episode-heresy/1100-6528871/" data-ref-id="1100-6528871">Destiny 2: Heresy</a> arrives early next month, players will find themselves back on the Dreadnaught, the Hive ship that's been left adrift since The Taken King expansion. And while players have fought inside the ship before, the Dreadnaught has undergone some changes since its last appearance. </p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," said Nikko Stevens--Destiny 2's Narrative Architect--during a feature <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on PlayStation's official site</a>. "The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>There are plenty of Taken enemies waiting for players on the Dreadnaught, and the goal of the mission is to push back against the corruption that has largely overtaken the ship. That's why this mission will introduce a new activity called The Nether. In this task, Players will be dispatched to disable the ship's internal weapons and prevent the Taken corruption from spreading. Both the players and their enemies can also be positively or negatively affected by boons which will shake up the balance of power between them.</p><p>Destiny 2: Heresy will launch on February 4 alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-getting-star-wars-gear-in-latest-crossover-collaboration/1100-6529080/" data-ref-id="1100-6529080">a collaboration with Star Wars</a> that introduce gear, armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are inspired by some of the Empire's fiercest warriors including the Death Troopers and the Imperial Guards. Some of Destiny 2's previous collaborations have featured items from and inspired by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lets-you-cosplay-as-commander-shepard-with-mass-effect-cosmetics-out-now/1100-6521058/" data-ref-id="1100-6521058">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-and-destiny-2-crossover-will-introduce-some-trendy-cosmetics-to-both-games/1100-6509625/" data-ref-id="1100-6509625">Assassin's Creed</a>.

                <p>Nearly two decades after its original release, the Quirky indie RPG is getting updated editions for Switch and PC later this year, giving players a chance to relive the cult-classic game that inspired other memorable RPGs like Undertale.

Youâ€™ll venture through multiple zones where you'll tackle challenging enemies in a battle system that doesnâ€™t rely on turn-based input--instead, you activate your abilities when their cooldown timer has reset. Off's memorable characters and retro-inspired visual style were a major influence on game designer Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale and Deltarune, and this new edition brings the inspiration full circle with Fox contributing new tracks to Off's soundtrack.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-is-discounted-at-amazon-but-probably-not-for-long/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Discounted At Amazon, But Probably Not For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-gets-rare-discount/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Gets Rare Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-discounted-on-launch-day/1100-6524388/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Is Discounted On Launch Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon/1100-6528683/">Last Chance To Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-ps5-reprint-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Microsoft has clarified that World of Warcraft is not coming to Xbox Game Pass. This comes after people received an email showing a World of Warcraft ad with the words "Join Game Pass," leading them to believe that the game would be coming to the subscription service.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">email's subject even said</a>, "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" The World of Warcraft portion of the email also featured an icon suggesting an Xbox console release of the game was coming. Microsoft has now issued a statement attributing all of this to a simple error.</p><p>"This was a mistake on our end, sorry for the confusion," said the official Game Pass <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1884300203882053922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter account</a>. "Blizzard's World of Warcraft was accidentally included in a game pass email even though it's not available with the service - a correction email will be sent to those who got the original email soon."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4434854-image_2025-01-28_154411768.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434854" data-ratio="0.64975845410628" data-width="1656" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4434854-image_2025-01-28_154411768.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434854"></a><figcaption>The email that some people received today</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4434854-image_2025-01-28_154411768.png"></figure><p>In response to the statement, a number of people have requested that World of Warcraft be added to Xbox Game Pass. One person <a href="https://x.com/kridentagg/status/1884301824771121653" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "The only mistake is that it's not on Game Pass and should be."</p><p>Microsoft acquired <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-activision-blizzard-franchises-microsoft-now-owns/2900-4896/" data-ref-id="2900-4896">Activision Blizzard back in 2023</a> and has added tons of games in the latter's back catalogue to Game Pass. However, World of Warcraft is not one of them, no doubt due to its business model revolving around a monthly subscription.</p><p>As for a console version of WoW, there are no announced plans. However, in 2023, its executive producer said that Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-on-console-might-have-some-renewed-hope/1100-6518932/" data-ref-id="1100-6518932">has at least thought about it</a> post-acquisition.</p><p>In other World of Warcraft news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-famous-pieces-of-cut-content-is-playable-today/1100-6529076/" data-ref-id="1100-6529076">Karazhan Crypts</a> is finally playable today as a dungeon.

                <p>Earlier this week, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> players mistakenly received early access to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Patch 8</a>--the final major update for the game--before its scheduled stress test. Now, Larian Studios has announced that the Patch 8 stress test is live, and it's introducing several new features including cross-play.</p><p>To familiarize players with the way cross-play will function, Larian has also released the following video that walks through the necessary steps to join up with friends who are playing on separate consoles or PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qX4ffv7xLsI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prior to launching Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X, Larian was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-add-split-screen-on-xbox-series-s-after-launch/1100-6517248/" data-ref-id="1100-6517248">forced to drop the split-screen feature from Xbox Series S.</a> After Patch 8, Series S users will finally get the split-screen option that Series X players have enjoyed since 2023. </p><p>Photo Mode is another prominent addition in Patch 8, alongside the 12 new subclasses that players can select. Larian notes that there are some known bugs that are still being worked out, which is why the stress test is being used to identify these issues before the official Patch 8 rollout begins to every player. </p><p>Once Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio's full attention will go to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Any potential sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by other studios</a>.

                <p>Destiny is getting crossover content with one of the biggest sci-fi franchises on the planet, as Bungie has announced a partnership with Lucasfilm to bring Star Wars content to Destiny 2.</p><p>Launching on February 4 with the Destiny 2: Heresy update, the Star Wars content includes new armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are "inspired by Star Wars." More specifically, the armor ornaments include one per Guardian class, and they are inspired by soldiers of the Galactic Empire. You can get a glimpse at the new armor in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673" data-ratio="0.56791569086651" data-width="854" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673"></a><figcaption>Destiny x Star Wars launches in February.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png"></figure><p>Destiny 2 has welcomed a number of licensed crossovers before, including franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lets-you-cosplay-as-commander-shepard-with-mass-effect-cosmetics-out-now/1100-6521058/" data-ref-id="1100-6521058">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-and-destiny-2-crossover-will-introduce-some-trendy-cosmetics-to-both-games/1100-6509625/" data-ref-id="1100-6509625">Assassin's Creed</a>, but Star Wars is the biggest yet in terms of prominence.</p><p>Bungie announced the Star Wars crossover and lots more during a broadcast on January 28. Also as part of this, Bungie confirmed that the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dreadnaught is returning to Destiny in Destiny 2: Heresy</a>, which is the final epilogue of the so-called Light and Darkness saga.</p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," Destiny 2 narrative architect Nikko Stevens said. "The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>In other Bungie news, the company underwent significant changes in 2024 when it announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a restructuring that will see some staffers form a new team inside parent company Sony to make a new game.</a> In addition to ongoing support for Destiny 2, Bungie is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">working on Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-dev-teases-sci-fi-project-inspired-by-frogs-comedy-mobas-and-fighting-games/1100-6517010/" data-ref-id="1100-6517010">a game inspired by frogs and comedy.</a></p>
