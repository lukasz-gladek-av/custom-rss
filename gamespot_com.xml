                <p>The city-building RTS Anno 117: Pax Romana had barely been released when sharp-eyed fans noticed the tell-tale signs of AI artwork in one of the loading screens. But rather than deny it, publisher Ubisoft has promised that it will replace the artwork in an upcoming update.</p><p>The image in question was first spotted by a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/the_ai_background_art_is_pretty_low_quality/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, as seen below. The scene is set at a Roman banquet, and the background elements and characters feature some common AI mistakes including misshapen faces and bodies that don't line up to human physiology. It may not even be the only AI pic in the game, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> has pointed out another image that has a pair of Roman senators who are <a href="https://imgur.com/g6SxNQb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">missing their heads</a>.</p><p>An Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-acknowledges-deliberate-ai-use-ubisoft-pledges-to-remove-ai-image-that-slipped-through-to-anno-117s-final-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the initial version of the banquet art was meant to be replaced in the final version of the game.</p><p>"This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process," said the Ubisoft spokesperson. "The final image ... will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4604107" data-ratio="0.56041666666667" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4604107"></a><figcaption>The updated and revised version of the pic that will be added to Anno 117: Pax Romana.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4604107-anno117paxromanareplacement.jpg"></figure><p>As seen above, the final image appears to be a retouched version of the AI pic. That makes the origin of the picture less obvious. Ubisoft has acknowledged that other AI tools were used for "for iterations, prototyping, and exploration." Regardless, the company stresses that the final version of the game "reflects the team's craft, artistry, and creative freedom."</p><p>This isn't the only game that's been recently called out over AI. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> apparently used AI to make the game's "Ghibli-style" Calling Cards. Activision subsequently acknowledged that some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7</a>. Arc Raiders also came under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI voiceover readings</a>. Congressman Ro Khanna subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">called for regulation</a> over the use of AI.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios has outlined the many changes coming to Battlefield 6 this week with the launch of the new 1.1.2.0 update on November 18, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-weapon-recoil-will-feel-smoother-after-next-update/1100-6536154/" data-ref-id="1100-6536154">promised changes for aim-assist.</a> You can see the full patch notes down below.</p><p>Aim-assist is also seeing changes that will make it feel more similar to the game's open beta. That should make aim-assist "feel smoother and more predictable," according to Battlefield Studios. The aim-assist changes apply to "all input types," including controller and mouse-and-keyboard setups.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes Of Battlefield 6 Season 1 New Maps Gameplay (Blackwell Fields and Eastwood)</p>
      </div>
<p>"As we got closer to launch, we revisited aim-assist tuning based on internal testing and the full range of maps and combat distances coming with release. Our goal was to make aim-assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and open beta," the developer said. "At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.</p><p>"After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim-assist back to the values some of you experienced during open beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings," Battlefield Studios added. "This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons."</p><p>The November 18 update is called California Resistance, and in addition to the aim-assist and other gameplay tuning changes, it adds new content, including the California-set map Eastwood. Variations of the map will be available for all modes, and for Conquest, it'll support tanks, helicopters, and the golf cart. There is also a new mode called Sabotage, which is a limited-time mode focused on "demolition and counterplay." New weapons are coming, too, including the DB-12 shotgun and the M357 Trait sidearm.</p><p>The Gauntlet mode, meanwhile, gets a new mission type in the form of Rodeo. "This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle," Battlefield Studios said.</p><p>There are also updates for the Portal mode, including the introduction of a sandbox mode that allows Portal users to "start with a more level playing field to bring their imagination to life." Additionally, the golf cart vehicle will be supported in Portal mode, while a "bonus path" part of the Season 1 battle pass called The California Resistance will be unlocked with the new update.</p><p>Beyond the new content, the 1.1.2.0 update adds further weapon accuracy and dispersion tuning and provides a "major polish pass" to deployable objects such as the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems.</p><p>Another change is the introduction of a new keybinding on PC that allows players to swap to the knife instantly instead of needing to hold the button. "This keybinding will not allow to perform takedowns contextually but will still allow takedowns to be performed once the melee weapon is equipped," the developer said.</p><p>There are a few changes for Battlefield Redsec as well, including a fix for a bug that caused the golf cart to set off the PTKM-1R gadget in the Gauntlet mode.

<p dir="ltr">They also feature persistent lobbies from match to match that, when combined with Quick Play, results in what Treyarch states are "unique interactions that we are monitoring to improve over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The decision to not include SBMM has been a major discussion point for Black Ops 7, after years of calls for it to be removed by some vocal players, not only in Call of Duty but in other shooters as well. Ubisoft's short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looked to capitalize on its lack of SBMM</a>. Call of Duty's main rival this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-does-not-prioritize-skill/1100-6533896/" data-ref-id="1100-6533896">Battlefield 6, does use SBMM to some extent</a>, but also factors in a player's location, ping, and server availability when putting together a match.</p><p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-black-ops-7-multiplayer-playlists-will-have-sbmm-but-most-wont/1100-6536138/" data-ref-id="1100-6536138">most modes and playlists in Black Ops 7 multiplayer don't use SBMM</a>, there are a few that do. Those include a rotating Moshpit playlist and the game's ranked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 received its latest patch on November 16, which fixed exploits in the Ashes of the Damned Zombies map, issues related to custom loadouts when using Spanish as the in-game language, and a bug that saw selected game modes in the Quick Play filter sometimes become inverted.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Black Ops 7 news, Activision confirmed in a statement that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">developers do use AI tools</a>, but that "our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios" amidst players accusing Black Ops 7 of using AI to generate artwork for Calling Cards. The game's Steam page also discloses that AI was used to develop some in-game assets.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 review</a>, reviewer S.E. Doster called the game's multiplayer package "a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue," while its co-op campaign "is not one of Treyarch's strongest campaigns" despite some strong emotional character moments that tie back to Black Ops 2.</p>
