                <p>Destiny 2 players who were waiting to start their week after the reset might have noticed something different this time around. Alongside Tess' Eververse products--which include a sweet, new Blanka from Street Fighter mask--Guardians can visit Banshee-44 for some really good loot, but you have to have completed at least one dungeon and specific dungeons for certain weapons.</p><p>The Tower's gunsmith is brandishing top-tier weapons with really good roll perks attached to them on the second page of his menu. The Stasis-powered grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor, is available but players need to have completed the Vesper's Host dungeon in order to nab. The same goes for the Indebted Kindness sidearm with the Warlord's Ruin dungeon.</p><p>As for the rest, the <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1858938507571720632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny 2 Team Twitter</a> account laid out the perks with the weapons available. They're pretty solid, and it sounds like a possible weekly feature.</p><ul><li>Rose - Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Explosive Payload, Smooth Grip, Handling MW</li><li>Multimach - Polygonal Rifling + Tactical Mag + Attrition Orbs + Kinetic Tremors + Reload MW</li><li>Indebted Kindness - Smart Drift Control + Tactical Mag + Loose Change + Voltshot + Velocity MW</li><li>Compass Rose - Corkscrew Rifling, Light Mag, Snapshot Sights, Slideshot, Handling MW</li><li>Hothead (Adept) - Hard Launch + Impact Casing + Tracking Module + Clown Cartridge + Reload MW</li><li>VS Chill Inhibitor - Countermass + Spike Grenades + Envious Arsenal + Bait and Switch + Reload MW</li></ul><p>"Starting Today, Banshee-44 has a small collection of weapons in the Tower with curated perk rolls. Our goal is to get you some perk combinations that were a bit harder to earn due to the RNG perk issue that was fixed in our previous update," the post read.</p><p>Just eyeballing the perk combinations, the build for that Compass Rose is really wild, stacking up the range and stability, especially with Slideshot attached. Same with Hothead and the Clown Cartridge feature, which randomly overfills the weapon from its reserves. </p><p>As of now, there's no end date for when these will be available, but it sounds as if these are different from the usual randomly rotating items Banshee offers each week. </p>

                <p>Starfield has crossed a new player milestone, reaching 15 million players, as developer Bethesda Game Studios also released a new update that includes the next land vehicle, a new quest, fixes, and more.</p><p>Starfield reached 6 million players on launch day--September 7, 2023--becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-already-has-over-6-million-players-making-it-bethesdas-biggest-launch-of-all-time/1100-6517567/" data-ref-id="1100-6517567">biggest launch in Bethesda's history</a>, and a launch no doubt fueled by Game Pass. The game climbed to 13 million players as of December 2023, and has now added at least two million more.</p><p>"We're thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game," <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/mqjRpu4DgOPKOdHE20SC1/starfields-november-update-is-now-live?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda said in a news release.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BotRDlQZYhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BotRDlQZYhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Starfield's November update is out now, introducing performance and stability improvements, along with the reintroduction of the uncapped frame rate option on Xbox Series X. Additionally, all Starfield Creations released through Bethesda's Verified Creators program will now work with achievements. Previously, select Creations blocked achievements, but this has now been fixed. However, achievements will not retroactively unlock.</p><p>Additionally, the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, is available now for everyone. "Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes," Bethesda said, noting that it has "exceptional handling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwankF0m64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urwankF0m64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, in the spirit of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday in the US, Starfield has added what's called "The Perfect Recipe." This is a new quest where players meet a person, Harbhajan, who is a gifted mechanic with a passion for cooking. "When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan--a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life," Bethesda said. "Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?"</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.

                <p>For the past eight years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-go-review/1900-6416477/" data-ref-id="1900-6416477">Pokemon Go</a> players have helped make Niantic's game one of the top titles in mobile gaming. Apparently, players have also been helping Niantic create a 3D model of the world, which is being expanded via AI into a Large Geospatial Model.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic made <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the largely unnoticed announcement</a> earlier this month. These plans have seemingly been in the works for a long time, and the company states that it is attempting to "help computers perceive, comprehend, and navigate the physical world." It also compares Large Geospatial Models to the Large Language Models used by OpenAI's GPT, Grok, and others.</p><p>Because Pokemon Go players are able to visit locations that cars can't access, they've given Niantic views of buildings and areas that other models haven't been able to see until now. Niantic explained that only the fronts of buildings have been identifiable from previous models, but the Large Geospatial Models can teach computers how to see and identify the other sides of buildings on a global scale.</p><p>One way Pokemon Go players have unwittingly contributed to this is through the recently released Pokemon Playgrounds feature, which lets them leave behind a Pokemon at a specific spot that can be found by other players. Niantic states that 10 million locations have been scanned through that feature from around the world, and 1 million new scans arrive every week.</p><p>According to the map of the model on Niantic's site, the company is far from mapping the entire globe. Most of the locations captured appear to be in North America and Europe, while Africa, Australia, and a large portion of Asia remain uncaptured for now. South America also has a long way to go before it will be fully captured by Niantic's AI model.</p><p>Outside of Pokemon Go, the franchise continues to thrive.

                <p>Blizzard has revealed its new Overwatch 2 hero, Hazard, in an animated trailer. Ahead of the launch of season 14 on December 10, you'll be able to play with the character from November 22-25.</p><p>Named Hazardous Tactics, the animated trailer showcases a heist on Oasis, spearheaded by The Phreaks gang. Hazard, nicknamed Haz by the video captions, fuses himself with a strange substance to gain supernatural strength, with visible spikes around his body. In addition, he has a minigun for a right arm, and a Scottish accent. Developer Activision Blizzard said there'll be new details on Hazard and his abilities later this week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR8N3cXWxqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sR8N3cXWxqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">Overwatch: Classic</a> is still available in Overwatch 2 until December 2. In this mode, you can only access the original roster of 21 heroes, as well as their original abilities. If you miss the old-school depictions of some of the available characters, Overwatch: Classic should scratch that nostalgic itch.</p><p>If you miss the 6v6 player matches from the first Overwatch, don't fret. The developer will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">conducting tests</a> during Season 14--the first will require a hero in each role, while the second test, slated for later in the season, will involve a classic 2-2-2 role composition with some tweaks.</p>
