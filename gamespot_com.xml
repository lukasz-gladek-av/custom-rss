                <p>It's a big day for Call of Duty, as the new Squid Game collaboration launches today, January 3, alongside a significant update across Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision has now posted the full patch notes, revealing all the significant changes and updates--and there are many.</p><p>Across Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone, all mantle speeds have been increased, while doors can now be opened and close while sprinting. Additionally, the Cleaver melee weapon is now available to unlock through the new Squid Game event reward in the new event pass, which costs 1,100 COD Points for the premium track.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja0LKjA4lxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ja0LKjA4lxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Activision warned that some players might see their Operator selections and customizations reset with the new update. Activision didn't say why this is occurring or what players can do about it beyond just starting over.</p><p>There are a bunch of new Squid Game-themed multiplayer modes available now in Black Ops 6, including Red Light, Green Light and one called Roulette Handgun. This mode allows players to obtain a powerful handgun that comes with the risk of killing the player, as each shot has a chance to blow up the weapon and the player.</p><p>There are no weapon-balance adjustments, but Black Ops 6's Scorestreaks are getting new tuning updates. This includes a reduction in max damage for the RC-XD and Care Packages now containing fewer Scout Pulses. The Sentry Turret, meanwhile, sees increases to its HP and fire rate, while the Watchdog Helo's damage is increased as well.</p><p>For Zombies, there is a new Squid Game mode called Dead Light, Green Light where players try to rack up zombie kills during the Green Light phase. When Red Light is called, any player who moves has essence drained from them. And when the Dead Light phase kicks in, players face off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies.</p><p>In Warzone, the January 3 patch fixes a number of bugs, including an error that would prevent the exfil animation to play during Ranked Play. The update also fixes an issue that incorrectly stopped players from using an Advanced UAV in some scenarios, and another issue pertaining to money drops.</p><p>The January 3 patch also brings a Squid Game mode to Warzone's Urzikstan map. This comes in the form of a rotating series of challenges, with teams eliminated each round until only one remains. Additionally, Red Light, Green Light can be triggered between rounds.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a></p><p>As for Squid Game, the second season of the popular Netflix series is out now. Season 3 is set for release later this year.</p><h2>Friday, January 3, 2025</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Increased all mantle speeds.</li><li>Doors can now be opened and closed while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>New Cleaver Melee weapon now available via Event rewards.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s view could become obstructed with specific weapons when using the Dark Practitioner Tracer Pack Bundle without an optic.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens would not be visible on the Saug Mecha-Drake Mastercraft Blueprint.</li><li>Hawker Hybrid optic now correctly works with the Ginger Dread Blueprint.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Improved AAR flow.  <ul><li>Added a Dismiss button to exit at any point and a timer.</li><li>Added a Summary at the end.</li></ul></li><li>Improved readability when searching for a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens could not be previewed.</li></ul><p>NOTE: Some players may see their Operator selections and Operator customizations reset after this update.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light (NEW)</b><ul><li>Young-hee is watching, so don’t misstep at the wrong time. Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long.</li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Pentathlon (NEW)</b><ul><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette.  <ul><li>In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match.</li><li>In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Squid Game Moshpit (NEW)</b><ul><li>Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as players gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features:  <ul><li>Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination.</li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within.</li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Prop Hunt</b><ul><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Wildcards</h4><ul><li><b>High Roller (NEW)</b><ul><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Scorestreaks</h4><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Archangel Launcher</b><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Care Package</b><ul><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>LDBR</b><ul><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sentry Turret</b><ul><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Strategic Bomber</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>A.G.R.

                <p dir="ltr">Each month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> players take part in the mobile game's Community Day: A recurring monthly event in which one Pokemon takes center stage and becomes available to catch in its Shiny form. January's Community Day Pokemon is Sprigatito, but players who want to get their hands on this grassy feline familiar will find themselves paying double the cost of past Community Day events.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, a Community Day Ticket was available to purchase in-game for just $1, but as of this month, that price is doubling to $2. The ticket does include a new reward (a battle pass), but Pokemon Go battle passes can often be found in bundled pairs that cost less.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes have been made to Community Day as well, but Pokemon Go developer Niantic says these changes may not be permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">"Starting with January Community Day, get ready to experience new free Timed Research, paid Special Research, and rare Field Research as you search for the featured Pokémon with Season-exclusive Special Backgrounds in Pokemon GO: Dual Destiny," reads an official <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/communityday-january-2025-sprigatito/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">blog post detailing January Community Day</a>.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation."</p>

                <p>If you've ever wondered about your skill level in Call of Duty, you now have a way to find out. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have discovered a way to get Activision to provide their previously hidden SBMM ratings, and it's really easy.</p><p>TheXclusiveAce has shared the method on his YouTube channel, which lays out the simple steps to get your personalized SBMM report going back to 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-personnel-problems/1900-6417780/" data-ref-id="1900-6417780">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a>. As noted by TheXclusiveAce, each report includes some highly personal data including your IP address, so think twice before sharing it unedited.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6Zw8tADVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZ6Zw8tADVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get access, the first step is to visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's privacy page</a> and login to your Activision account. TheXclusiveAce also mentioned that he had to login to his PSN account as well. After that, submit a personal information access request. Prior to the video above, the wait time was around a day before Activision e-mailed the file out. But since this method is now widely known, there may be additional delays.</p><p>The report itself is a very through examination of each player's Call of Duty history, as it tracks every match played, as well as the mode, the operator who was used, the number of hits taken, the longest streak, and more. It's a lot to take in. The report also charts the course of each player's skill ranking as it rises or falls depending upon their activities in the games.</p><p>SBMM ratings are used to place Call of Duty players in lobbies with similarly skilled players, as determined by Activision's criteria. Not every player may agree with these assessments, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-player-pleads-with-call-of-duty-to-put-him-in-the-trash-lobbies/1100-6528596/" data-ref-id="1100-6528596">NBA's Donovan Mitchell recently pleaded with Activision</a> to put him "in the trash lobbies." Over time, it's possible that the most experienced Call of Duty players may be able to utilize the info in their player reports to enhance their ratings.</p><p>Recently, Activision debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">a stoner-lizard DLC</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-patch-notes-increase-xp-earn-rates-for-bo6-and-fix-a-broken-operator-in-warzone/1100-6528419/" data-ref-id="1100-6528419">a new patch for Black Ops 6</a> that's meant to address other issues in the game as well. Meanwhile, Treyarch unveiled a collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/" data-ref-id="1100-6528158">Black Ops 6 and Netflix's Squid Game</a>.</p>
