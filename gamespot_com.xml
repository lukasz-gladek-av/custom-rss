                <p>More than 12 years ago, Steam creator Valve attempted to usurp Microsoft's hold on PC gaming by introducing the first Steam Machine. The reliance on Linux and a loose hold on OEM hardware specifications ultimately led to its failure, but Valve is finally in a position to give it a better shot. The new Steam Machine is a compact, powerful PC designed for desks, living rooms, and more, leveraging all of the lessons Valve has learnt with its hugely successful Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">We're rounding up everything we know about Valve's ambitious push into living room gaming, including confirmed specifications, its release window, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">potential pricing</a>, and more. Keep checking for more as we update this post with any new information that Valve shares leading up to the Steam Machine's imminent release in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</a></li></ul></li></ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Specifications_">Steam Machine Specifications </a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</h4><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine will be released in Q1 2026. Valve announced a trio of new hardware at once, but also didn't provide a firm release date for the new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame VR headset. Instead, it provided a vague release window of "Early 2026," with further clarification limiting this to Q1 of 2026. That means you can expect the Steam Machine to go on sale no later than 31 March 2026, unless Valve runs into unforeseen delays.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Another crucial detail missing from Valve's Steam Machine announcement was its price. The Steam Machine is a PC, and not strictly a console in the traditional sense, which might mean it will be priced higher than expected. That's backed up by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">statements made by Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat</a> who tempered expectations by reaffirming that the Steam Machine is competing with other similarly powered PCs on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Analysts have predicted a price between $400-$500, saying that the lower end of that range would be the "sweet spot" that would put pressure on the likes of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X. Valve still sells the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck, starting at $400 for the base LCD model and rising all the way up to $650 for the 1TB OLED model.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Specifications_"><span>Steam Machine Specifications</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While its price and release date are still a mystery, Valve was far more open with regards to what you're getting with each Steam Machine. The small form factor PC will be sold with two storage options to choose from–namely 256GB and 2TB–while also offering an easy way to install new, larger SSDs in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the storage, each Steam Machine will be identical. It's equipped with a capable AMD Zen CPU, featuring 6 cores and 12 threads with a maximum boost clock speed of 4.8GHz. That's paired with 16GB of DDR5 memory via SODIMM modules, which Valve also says will be accessible for upgrades down the line. Unlike modern consoles, the Steam Machine isn't going with an APU approach, instead settling on a dedicated GPU that is soldered onto the same board as the CPU. This is a AMD RDNA 3 GPU with 28 compute units and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, with many noting that it closely matches the specifications of the AMD RX 7600 from a few years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine will run Valve's impressive SteamOS--a heavily modified version of Linux Arch which turns the operating system into an easy-to-use version of Steam Big Picture mode. While primarily configured for use with Steam, SteamOS still lets users boot into a desktop version of Linux, letting you configure other storefronts (like the Epic Games Store, GOG, and others) as well as install anything from emulators to word processors. It is a PC, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of specifications</a> below.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Category</th><th scope="col">Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td><p>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T (up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td><p>Semi-Custom AMD RDNA3 28CUs (2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC power 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td><p>Two Steam Machine models (512GB and 2TB) NVMe SSD. MicroSD card slot for additional storage expansion</p></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td><p>DisplayPort 1.4</p><ul><li>Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz</li><li>Supports HDR, FreeSync, and daisy-chaining</li></ul><p>HDMI 2.0</p><ul><li>Up to 4K @ 120Hz</li><li>Supports HDR, FreeSync, and CEC</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td><p>Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports in the front</p><p>Two USB-A 2.0 High speed ports in the back</p><p>One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port in the back</p></td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customizability</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr">This combination puts the Steam Machine in the same realm as current-gen consoles, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rv83LgXiN0">Digital Foundry's Richard Ledbetter</a> stating that it likely sits somewhere between the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5. While the CPU seems perfectly capable for modern gaming demands, there is some concern with the GPU, specifically with its current memory allocation. Many modern games have had some trouble running well on GPUs with 8GB of VRAM or less, with even the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 offering more bandwidth for game developers (closer to 10GB for each). This limits the Steam Machine when it comes to storing textures in memory, which can become an issue the closer you try and push this towards 4K/ 60FPS gaming that Valve says its PC is capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">That is caveated with the use of AI-upscaling techniques, specifically AMD's FSR 3 given the GPU limitation of the RDNA 3 architecture over AMD's newer RDNA4. Currently this means that the Steam Machine cannot make use of the better FSR4 upscaling as well as AMD's latest frame generation technology, which would help deliver better higher resolutions experiences. Right now, it seems that Valve is cognizant of the potential price of the Steam Machine and is configuring it appropriately, making its eventual announcement even more crucial to the device's appeal.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</h4><p dir="ltr">While the Steam Machine will be compatible with most controllers on the market today, including the Xbox Series controller and PlayStation DualSense, Valve will also be shipping a new version of its Steam Controller with the PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking all of the lessons learnt with the controller configuration of the Steam Deck, the Steam Controller looks almost like Valve just removed the large screen from the middle, squished the two ends together, and called it a day. And that's a great thing--the Steam Deck is incredibly comfortable to hold despite not always looking like it, and the same thing seems to be true for the Steam Controller given early hands-on impressions.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike Valve's previous controller, this new version comes with two thumbsticks in a symmetrical format, powered by new TMR modules that Valve says combine the accuracy of hall-effect technology with even more reliability. Below them are a pair of haptic touchpads which allow you to easily play mouse-based games, as well as map additional functionality to them depending on your needs. The controller comes with motion control support, which can be used with capacitive sensors that activate as you grip the controller. This can be used in a variety of ways, with Valve using gyro aiming (which you can toggle by simply holding the controller) as a common example.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller also features new, higher-definition rumble motors for improved vibrations over the Steam Deck, as well as the same analogue triggers and four programmable grip buttons on the back. The controller connects to the Steam Machine, or any other desktop, using a proprietary puck for the fastest and most stable connection. The puck features pogo pin capabilities too, letting you set your Steam Controller onto it for easy charging. The Steam Controller can connect via Bluetooth or wired connections too for more flexibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it will bundle the Steam Controller with the Steam Machine at launch, and also offer the controller to purchase separately. You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full specifications</a> below.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Category</th><th scope="col">Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gamepad controls</td><td><p>A B X Y buttons</p><p>D-pad</p><p>L &amp; R analog triggers</p><p>L &amp; R bumpers</p><p>View &amp; Menu buttons</p><p>Steam &amp; QAM buttons</p><p>4x assignable grip buttons</p></td></tr><tr><td>Thumbsticks</td><td>2x full-size magnetic thumbsticks (TMR) with capacitive touch</td></tr><tr><td>Haptics</td><td><p>4x haptic motors</p><ul><li>2x LRA haptic motors in trackpads for HD tactile feedback</li><li>2x High output LRA haptic motors in grips for HD game haptics including rumble</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Trackpads</td><td><p>2x 34.5mm square trackpads with haptic feedback</p><p>Pressure-sensitive for configurable click strength</p></td></tr><tr><td>Gyro</td><td>6-axis IMU</td></tr><tr><td>Grip Sense</td><td>2x capacitive areas along back of Steam Controller handles</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller Puck</td><td><p>2.4GHz Wireless connection</p><p>~8ms full end-to-end, 4ms polling rate (measured at 5m)</p><p>Up to 4 Steam Controllers per Steam Controller Puck</p><p>Steam Controller Puck connects to PC via USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 4.2 minimum, 5.0 or higher recommended</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>USB-C tethered play</td></tr><tr><td>Charging</td><td><p>Steam Controller Puck charging interface</p><p>USB-C connector</p></td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td><p>8.39 Wh Li-ion battery</p><p>35+ hours of gameplay*</p><p><i>Battery life for tracked gameplay with Steam Frame is reduced</i></p></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td><p>Steam Controller: 111mm x 159mm x 57mm</p><p>Steam Controller Puck: 50mm x 28mm x 9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td><p>Steam Controller: 292 g</p><p>Steam Controller Puck: 16 g</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The previous year, the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1727010137477624184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty account shared</a> some more select statistics to celebrate MW3 as having "the highest engagement in the new Modern Warfare trilogy."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>The Black Ops 7 post, shared at the end of the 3-day launch period, is far more vague with its celebrations. "Across opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," the post reads, alongside thanking players and developers, and promising "this is only the start," with new content lined up soon.</p><p>Black Ops 7 had big shoes to fill after the success of Black Ops 6, which managed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">set new records</a> for Game Pass sign ups, while still driving a major increase in sales on competing platforms like Steam and PlayStation.</p><p>The latest Call of Duty title has come under fire for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">alleged use of generative AI</a>, with some fans speculating that the distinctive Ghibli-style art for certain Calling Cards had been AI generated. The debate has even seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">US Congressman Ro Khanna</a> use the game as justification to call for greater regulations around the use of generative AI.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7's multiplayer</a> has generally been well-received, the co-op campaign has mostly been met with criticism. Both disappointing campaign narrative and anger around the use of AI appear to have contributed to players review-bombing the game on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>, leaving Black Ops 7 with a user score of just 1.7. The game also has a "Mixed" review score on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, with only 41% positive reviews.</p><p>Outside of the game's own struggles, Black Ops 7 has also launched into an exceptionally competitive year for large-scale shooters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> continues to go strong after its October launch, while Embark Studios' new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> also hit a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">new concurrent player peak over the weekend</a>, with the release of its first major update no-doubt eating some of CoD's player base.</p>

When it finally released in 2023, it was one of the year's best games, earning a coveted 10 out of 10 from GameSpot's Mark Delaney in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">his review.</a> In it, players once again assume the role of titular troubled writer Alan Wake, who has been trapped in the Dark Place since the end of the first game. This time, however, you also play as FBI Agent Saga Anderson, who's been sent to Bright Falls, Washington to investigate mysterious and gruesome ritualistic murders. The game features stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, great writing, and plenty of jump scares, perfect for fans of the survival horror genre.</p><p>If you're looking for something less spooky, there are still plenty of other games getting early Black Friday price cuts.

                <p>In June, Hypixel and its parent company, Riot Games, announced that the Minecraft-inspired adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after 10 years of development. At that time, Hypixel was set to be shuttered as well. But now, the founders of Hypixel have rescued the studio with plans to finally bring Hytale into early access.</p><p>Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced the news on social media that his studio has repurchased the rights for Hytale from Riot Games and plans to release it as soon as possible. However, he cautioned fans to temper their expectations as the game remains unpolished. While Collins-Laflamme acknowledged that "there's a lot of work to be done," he added that there will be, "No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479578239049974" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We did it. Hytale is saved. We have acquired Hytale from Riot Games.</p>  — Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479578239049974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hytale's official site</a>, Collins-Laflamme noted that he and his Hypixel co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the resurrected Hytale, with Kevin Carstens as the technical lead and Patrick Derbic as the management lead. They also announced that 30 developers who previously worked on Hytale have been hired to return.</p><p>Collins-Laflamme also revealed that the team is dropping the current Cross-platform Engine build of Hytale because it "is significantly behind in terms of gameplay" and it would take years to reach early access. Instead, the team is reverting back to The Legacy Engine build, which is four-years old and significantly further along.</p><p>Early access is expected to "last at least a few years," as the team doesn't want to rush it through development. Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and modding will be available at the launch of early access. However, minigames and Adventure Mode will be saved for a later date. The Hypixel founders added that they are committed to funding this project for 10 years, and they are fully independent with no outside investors or publishers. </p>
