                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> releases on November 14, and Treyarch's latest <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> revealed plenty of new changes for the game's multiplayer. This includes one of the most requested changes from the beta, which makes adjustments to the game's movement and the Dexterity perk.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest Dev Talk video featured Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce, who discussed the community complaints about the Dexterity perk. Black Ops 7 initially removed the ability to aim down sights with weapons while diving and sliding, and players needed to equip the Dexterity perk to get the same fluid movement offered in Black Ops 6. Scronce announced that player feedback was considered, and Dexterity will no longer be needed to ADS while sliding or diving. Players can still equip the perk to speed up those specific actions, but it's no longer required to perform the movement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We've got some BIG updates to MP coming out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> Beta in our latest Dev Talk:<br>✅ ADS &amp; Dexterity changes<br>✅ Aim assist adjustments<br>✅ Louder footsteps<br>✅ New slide tuning<br>✅ Perk distribution updates<br>✅ New Perk combinations<br>✅ Faster mantle speeds<br>➕ more to come! <a href="https://t.co/2BVcHUXnu0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/2BVcHUXnu0</a></p>  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Adjustments are also made to the game's sliding and the mantling movements. The slide speed is lowered and distance has been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">"It still feels great. It still feels fluid," Scronce said when discussing the slide tuning. "But we want to make sure that's not the only way you can enter an engagement."</p><p dir="ltr">For mantling, the developer agreed with feedback that some of the mantling speeds felt too slow. Scrone said the team is going through every mantle in the game to make sure they all have consistent speed and everything feels fast and fluid.</p><p dir="ltr">Perk changes were also announced. Some perks were moved to different categories, and unpopular perks were combined to make more powerful options. One complaint from the beta was that so many powerful perks were stacked in the slot 1 category, so some of the perks are now shifted around to allow players to choose better perk combinations. This includes Tac Mask being moved from slot 1 to slot 2, Tac Sprinter from slot 3 to slot 1, and Cold-Blooded from slot 1 to slot 3.</p><p dir="ltr">As for combined perks, Black Ops 7's Shadow perk is being combined with the Engineer perk. This will allow players to not only see enemy traps but also move past them without triggering any effects. For melee players, Bruiser is now combined with the Close Shave perk. This will allow increased health regen and score for melee kills.</p><p dir="ltr">Aim-assist changes are also confirmed. The developer revealed that data collected from the beta revealed controller players were winning close-range fights, while mouse-and-keyboard players were winning longer-range fights. Because of this, Treyarch is making changes to rotational aim assist, including requiring the right thumbstick to be moving in the direction of a target for aim assist to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has received a few other major changes since its initial reveal. Catering to community feedback, Activision revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Call of Duty's Carry Forward program was canceled</a>. Black Ops 6 weapons, operators skins, and cosmetic items will no longer transfer over to Black Ops 7, with the only exception being some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/">Zombies-related content</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher also revealed that Black Ops 7 would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-multiplayer-will-be-non-sbmm-by-default-at-launch/1100-6535334/">launch with little or no SBMM</a>, making the game's matchmaking feel more like the classic system used in older Call of Duty games. This matchmaking change is something a portion of the community has been requesting for years.</p>

                <p>NFL football, and Madden by extension, isn't all about touchdowns, physical toughness, and Taylor Swift after all. EA wants you to care about kickers, too, and not just when they miss game-deciding kicks.</p><p>The latest Madden 26 update increases the maximum distance that talented kickers with a 99 KPW, also known as Kick Power Attribute, can now kick--up to 70-yard field goals.</p>

<p>"As part of our ongoing commitment to authenticity, we’ve incorporated this record-setting event from the real NFL into the game," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-october-22-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">development blog</a> detailing the update reads. "The historic 70-yard field goal was an extraordinary achievement that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible on the field. We brought this into Madden, giving players the chance to recreate this iconic moment themselves."</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little set this record during the 2025 NFL preseason in an August matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers--quite the impressive accomplishment considering it was the first game of the preseason for both teams. It surpassed the previous NFL regular-season record of 66 yards.</p><p>“Can’t lie, there was probably a little bit of doubt," Little told ESPN in an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45934622/jaguars-kicker-cam-little-nails-70-yard-field-goal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "But I mean, we attempted a lot of long field goals in training camp. Had some 60, probably 65-pluses before [in practice]. And so, you know, I really wanted to just go out there and see what it would do.”</p><p>The jersey and shoe Little wore during the kick are now on display in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although the kick does not count toward official NFL record books since it took place in the preseason.</p>

                <p>Fortnite is reportedly set to get a major update in November that adds a big crossover with the iconic animated franchise The Simpsons. Now, the latest leaks have suggested that it won't just be The Simpson family coming to Fortnite, but also some of Springfield's residents, including Ned Flanders.</p><p>Flanders is among the best-known characters on The Simpsons, so his inclusion in the update would be little surprise. We don't know if this is true just yet, so take the leak with a grain of salt for now. Will there be a skin that celebrates <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Stupid_Sexy_Flanders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"stupid sexy Flanders"</a>? We'll have to wait and see.</p><p>The rumored upcoming Fortnite collaboration with The Simpsons is said to be significant, with Fortnite adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">new map based on Springfield</a> and featuring its various points of interest, like the nuclear power plant where Homer works.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">everything we've heard so far about the rumored Simpsons collaboration with Fortnite.</a> The new season is rumored to begin in early November.</p><p>In semi-related news, a fan-made re-skin of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run focusing on Futurama has <a href="https://x.com/UltimateSema/status/1980611084353696072" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drawn the praise of one of the game's original designers</a>.</p><p>As for the TV series, The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and is now in its 37th season. The show was renewed earlier this year and will continue through at least Season 40 in 2028-2029. A second Simpsons Movie is coming as well, and it's set for release in July 2027, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">on the same day as A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

                <p>Following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price hike for Xbox consoles sold to consumers implemented earlier this year</a>, Microsoft is now raising hardware prices for developers. Microsoft has confirmed that it has raised the price of a Xbox Development Kit (XDK), with the price reportedly going up from $1,500 to $2,000. That's a 33% hike.</p><p>"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, without confirming the exact dollar amount that the site reported. "We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts."</p><p>When Microsoft announced the price increase for Xbox consoles sold to consumers, the technology giant also cited macroeconomic concerns. The price increases are likely in response to US President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from China, which are 30% currently.</p><p>The Verge said the price hike for XDKs are going up in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world.</p><p>The XDK's price factors in its 40GB Of GDDR6 memory, compared to 16GB on the Xbox Series X consumer model, along with more compute units. These XDKs also include three USB ports, debugging tools, a front panel display, and other elements not found in consumer models.</p><p>Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-should-be-an-easy-choice-but-microsoft-is-making-me-reconsider-my-sub/1100-6535539/" data-ref-id="1100-6535539">raised prices on Xbox Game Pass</a>, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Ultimate tier going up 50% to $30/month.</a> The company has admitted that price increases are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody/1100-6535163/" data-ref-id="1100-6535163">"never fun for anybody,."</a> Microsoft CFO Amy Hood is reportedly mandating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>.</p><p>Microsoft will release its next earnings report on October 29, at which point the company will share an update on how much money it's made over the past three months.</p>

                <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is launching an investigation into developer Roblox Corporation, alleging that the online game creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is a "breeding ground" for predators that enables child abuse.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-issues-criminal-subpoenas-roblox-protect-children" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a> from the Republican's office, Uthmeier said he and his team will be issuing Roblox Corporation "criminal subpoenas" for "profiting off of our kids and exposing them to the most dangerous of harms." This investigation will allow Uthmeier to determine whether the company's action or inaction aids child abuse.</p><p>"Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids," Uthmeier said in an October 20 video posted to X. "These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on the Roblox platform, as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are issuing criminal subpoenas to Roblox, which has become a breeding ground for predators to gain access to our kids. <a href="https://t.co/vcyTVnkrxU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/vcyTVnkrxU</a></p>  — Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Roblox has faced scrutiny over its child safety, particularly <span>following <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="nofollow ">a</a></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> June 2024 Bloomberg report</a> that found the platform has a rampant pedophile problem. AGs Russell Coleman (R-Kentucky) and Liz Murrill (R-Louisiana) have issued lawsuits against Roblox for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/kentucky-lawsuit-roblox-fails-protect-children-popular-online-126310412" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">failing to protect children</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/louisiana-sues-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">facilitating the distribution of child sexual abuse material</a>. Meanwhile, two other lawsuits--<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one filed in Georgia</a> and <a href="https://www.kgns.tv/2025/08/22/13-year-old-girl-targeted-by-predator-roblox-lawsuit-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another in St. Louis</a>--alleged that two kids (one eight and the other 13) were targeted by predators. Nearly 40% of Roblox's users are under the age of 13, and although Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik said the recent negative press towards the game is based on events from "<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five years ago</a>," these lawsuits were filed this year.</p><p>This is what prompted Uthmeier to investigate Roblox Corporation. He explained in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/2025-0909_roblox.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the full subpoena</a> that, through the multiple investigations revealing that predators are grooming minors with the in-game currency Robux, the company must face justice.</p><p>"At the end of the day, we will stop at nothing to fight to protect our kids," he said. "And companies that act carelessly and expose them to harm will be held accountable."</p><p>Roblox Corporation now must respond to the subpoena and appear before Tampa, Florida's assistant statewide prosecutor Rita Pavan Peters on December 20.</p>
