                <p>Before BioWare released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-review/1900-6084514/" data-ref-id="1900-6084514">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-review/1900-6183119/" data-ref-id="1900-6183119">Mass Effect</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review/1900-6238632/" data-ref-id="1900-6238632">Dragon Age Origins</a>, it revisited the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons in 2002 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverwinter-nights-review/1900-2872002/" data-ref-id="1900-2872002">Neverwinter Nights</a>. In the nearly 23 years since its release, Neverwinter Nights has remained popular with players who have supported the title with fan-made mods. Now, there's a new expansion for Neverwinter Nights called Doom of Icewind Dale, and it's officially authorized by Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Doom of Icewind Dale was developed by Luke Scull, a game developer who got his start as a modder for Neverwinter Nights before joining Ossian Studios and working on the official expansion for Neverwinter Nights 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverwinter-nights-2-mysteries-of-westgate-review/1900-6209264/" data-ref-id="1900-6209264">Mysteries of Westgate</a>. Scull also established himself as a fantasy author outside of the gaming realm, and he's crafted Doom of Icewind Dale as the first installment of a new multi-part storyline called The Blades of Netheril.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449255" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449255"></a><figcaption>A screencap from Doom of Icewind Dale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449257,1300-4449258,1300-4449259,1300-4449260,1300-4449261" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg"></figure><p>The story for Doom of Icewind Dale begins around two decades after Neverwinter Nights' campaign with the player's character left for dead and their memories stripped away. From there, players have to reclaim their identity, figure out why they were abducted, and "uncover a sinister plot to unleash a rage-filled godling upon the North."</p><p>The base game is required to play the expansion, but Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is currently on sale on Fanatical. As for Doom of Icewind Dale itself, players can pick it up for $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3093340/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition_Doom_of_Icewind_Dale/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It has approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay that lets players explore some of the 10 towns of Icewind Dale, as well as other locations including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. It also includes new monsters and original music created for the expansion.</p><p>Like several of D&amp;D's adaptations, Neverwinter Nights and Doom of Icewind Dale are set in The Forgotten Realms. That setting is also going to be used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-developing-a-live-action-dungeons-dragons-series-set-in-the-forgotten-realms-report/1100-6529513/" data-ref-id="1100-6529513">the Dungeons &amp; Dragons live-action series</a> that is currently in development.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

                <p>Starry Studio has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/547853571373140323" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it'll be conducting a closed beta test for cross-save on Once Human. It'll take place starting on February 27 at 8 PM PT / 11 PM ET and ends on March 1 at 3 AM PT / 6 AM PT.</p><p>The beta test will only be between iOS and Android platforms, with progress during the beta test being retained afterwards. All scenarios will be available for this beta test, and progression is fully cross-platform with Once Human's PC version. Players on Steam, Epic Games Store, and Starry Studio's launcher, Loading Bay, can use their existing characters for the beta test.</p><p>In order to get access to this beta test, players will be invited via <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.easebar.com%2Fhtmls%2F863iir%2Fpaper.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>. Successful applications will receive an invite to the beta test through the player's in-game mail.</p><p>Once Human currently has cross-play meaning that players on announced platforms can play with each other as long as they're on the same server. However, cross-save is being worked on at the moment as it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-once-human-have-cross-play-or-cross-progression-steam-limitations-explained/1100-6524796/" data-ref-id="1100-6524796">"limitations."</a> Starry Studio said <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/once-human-console-port-is-next-important-milestone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that a console version</a> of Once Human is coming after it wraps up development of the mobile version, which are set to launch on April 10 for iOS and Android.</p><p>Once Human is now available for PC. It's a free-to-play game that launched last year and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/once-human-makes-a-big-splash-and-first-descendant-stays-strong-on-most-played-games-charts/2900-5623/" data-ref-id="2900-5623">made it to the #4 slot</a> of Steam's top 10 most-played games during the week it was released.</p>
