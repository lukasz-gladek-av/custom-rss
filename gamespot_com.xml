                <p>Vampire Survivors has spawned a wave of games inspired by it in the years since it was first released, and Warhammer Survivors is the next game set in this genre of endless hordes and power-ups. Featuring characters and weapons from both Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Survivors is a co-production between Auroch Digital and Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, using the same engine that powers the roguelite survivors game it's inspired by. It's scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5E_EaxN1qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like Vampire Survivors, the focus will be on taking down waves of enemies, powering up your character, and evolving your weapons.
