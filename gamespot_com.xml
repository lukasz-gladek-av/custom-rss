However, GSC also didn't sugar coat the state of the game at launch.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A message from the GSC Game World Team.<br>Before you step into the Zone, we’d like to take a moment to share something from the heart. <a href="https://t.co/wuLRAkq7Ba" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/wuLRAkq7Ba</a></p>  — S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

"We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before."</p><p dir="ltr">Numerous reviews, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">GameSpot's Stalker 2 review</a>, took notice of the game's technical problems, reporting numerous visual bugs and frequent crashes. GameSpot reviewer Richard Wakeling said the game's "torrent of technical issues" ultimately hampers the game's oppressive atmosphere. The first-person shooter combines elements of military sims and survival horror, as players attempt to survive a Chornobyl exclusion zone filled with mutants, hostile humans, and strange anomalies.</p><p dir="ltr">GSC Game World, for its part, said it's committed to the game and making improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention," GSC said in its statement. "In the first days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can."</p><p dir="ltr">Larger updates and additional improvements will come over time, GSC said, which will include free in-game content. A content roadmap for Stalker 2 will be revealed in December.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have big plans for the Stalker universe," GSC said. "In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey."</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 is available on Xbox Series X|S and PC, where it's also available via Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Activision has revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players can get a nice bonus in Call of Duty: Warzone. A new trailer called "Maximize Your Gameplay" confirms the people who buy Black Ops 6 receive a 30% XP boost in the free-to-play battle-royale title. GameSpot understands that people who play through Game Pass can also get the XP boost.</p><p>The fine print in the trailer specifies that the 30% XP boost is only available during the seasonal content for Black Ops 6, which suggests it'll end in time for 2025's inevitable Call of Duty game. Still, the 30% XP boost should last for nearly a year, which is a nice perk if you want to spend $70 to buy the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW01Rr3rMDw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BW01Rr3rMDw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other XP news, the legacy double XP tokens that were removed from Black Ops 6 have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/" data-ref-id="1100-6527868">reinstated</a>, and that's good news for people hoping to level up faster.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/">Season 1 of Call of Duty</a> continues to add new content to the game, with Ranked Play mode arriving to multiplayer on November 21.
