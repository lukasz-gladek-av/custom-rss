He's aided by Aiba, an AI companion who lives inside of his cybernetic eye, and together the duo dive into dreams and reassemble memories to help track down culprits.</p><p>If you're curious about Kaname Date's previous adventures, you can also pick up the first two games in the The first game,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/AI-Somnium-Files-Day-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07PYT8GK9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> AI: The Somnium Files</a>, introduced audiences to Date as he tracked down an elusive serial killer.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 8 launches April 29 and, in addition to overhauling the game's endgame boss system, will also completely rework its battle pass to give players more control over which rewards interest them the most.</p><p dir="ltr">The new battle pass system is called The Reliquary, and it breaks down rewards that would typically be in the battle pass into a number of different categories. The core seasonal Reliquary will actually be free, and at least for Season 8, will include a new Town Portal cosmetic, a weapon cosmetic, mount cosmetics, and some of the game's premium currency, Platinum. Meanwhile, separate Reliquaries for cosmetic armor, weapons, and "beasts" (aka pets and mounts) will also be available to unlock with Platinum.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478344" data-ratio="0.56210191082803" data-width="1884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478344"></a><figcaption>A look at what all is new in Diablo 4 Season 8.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4478344-diablo4season8infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each reward in each Reliquary can be unlocked in any order using a new currency called Favor Tokens that are earned from slaying monsters and completing quests. Claiming all of the rewards from a particular Reliquary will then grant a bonus reward that doesn't require a Favor Token to unlock. Players will be able to hold 99 Favor Tokens at one time, with items costing anywhere from two Favor Token to 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Individually, each Reliquary is cheaper than Diablo 4's previous battle passes, and Blizzard will offer a premium battle pass bundle that will include all of a season's Reliquaries for 1,000 Platinum, the same price as previous battle passes.</p><p dir="ltr">In a group interview attended by GameSpot, Diablo 4 associate director of game design Colin Finer shared more insight into what prompted the battle pass change.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we were thinking about the battle pass, we had gotten a lot of feedback that it just wasn't in the spirit of Diablo," Finer said. "There was just a bunch of stuff that you didn't actually care about. You're grinding through a bunch of things and you didn't really have any agency. That didn't feel Diablo. Diablo's all about that agency, playing it your way. That's why we have bosses that allow you to target Uniques. We felt like the battle pass wasn't servicing that.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the changes to the battle pass and introducing the Reliquary system is really about putting players in the driver's seat in order to target the rewards they are looking for. We think this is a lot more Diablo, it's a lot more control on the player's end. We think it's a pretty big improvement."</p><p dir="ltr">Players may remember that Diablo 4's previous battle passes actually granted players free seasonal power in the form of Smoldering Ashes that could be used to improve Season Blessings, buffs that granted more XP or other perks for the duration of the season. While the old battle pass system is no more, Smoldering Ashes and Season Blessing will now be incorporated as part of the game's Seasonal Journey system and work exactly as before.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be special Event Reliquaries that will be available for shorter amounts of time than a typical season. That piece of info goes hand-in-hand with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-crossing-over-with-dark-fantasy-manga-series-berserk-for-its-first-ip-collab/1100-6530944/" data-ref-id="1100-6530944">Diablo 4's upcoming IP crossover with the dark fantasy manga, Berserk</a>, set to begin on May 6 and which will no doubt take advantage of the new system.</p>

It not only brings new bosses into the endgame, including the return of the fan-favorite Belial from Diablo 3, but also makes changes to existing bosses to make them more challenging. It overhauls how to access (and gain loot from) endgame bosses, as well as a few other flourishes to make the whole endgame boss loop more interesting, and rewarding, than before. The icing on top is that defeating each boss will let players harness some of their most-iconic abilities in the form of new seasonal powers that can be incorporated into builds for game-changing combinations.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot chatted with Diablo 4 lead season designer Deric Nuñez and associate director of game design Colin Finer ahead of Season 8 to get more insight about the upcoming changes, learning why Blizzard wanted to prioritize boss ladder changes (now referred to by Blizzard as the Lair Boss system) ahead of other endgame updates coming later in the year. We also discussed how the team looked to address negative social experiences while grouping up for boss runs with Season 8's changes, and how the team used Belial's return as a way to inject more personality into the entire endgame system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss Ladder Reborn</h2><p dir="ltr">When it came time to decide what endgame feature to focus on improving first, Nuñez said the team looked at what changes would have the "most immediate impact." The boss ladder was an obvious choice, and the team knew that just adding Belial as a new boss wouldn't cut it. The whole system needed to change.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a very heavily trafficked and highly engaged-with endgame feature," Nuñez said. "All of our endgame features are top priorities but we have to start stack ranking in some regards, so we saw a really cool opportunity…to put the Lair Boss system front and center, from just a prioritization and player-impact perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 8, much of what players know about fighting the game's endgame bosses is gone. No longer do players need multiple types of summoning materials per boss. Instead, players can challenge the bosses at any time, without having to pay an upfront material cost only to then find it too challenging. Each boss will item chest that can be looted after their defeat, but only if a player has a boss-specific Lair Key to open it. Loot pools have been adjusted to offer a wider-range of Unique items as rewards while still keeping the ability to target farm specific Uniques from specific bosses intact. On higher Torment difficulties, bosses will reward even more loot than before. And Belial, one of the biggest and most memorable boss fights in the franchise's history, now permeates every aspect of the system by not only serving as Diablo 4's new greatest challenge but by also having a chance to appear and wreak havoc while fighting other bosses as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479007" data-ratio="0.56241699867198" data-width="3012" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479007"></a><figcaption>Belial has a chance to appear after defeating endgame bosses, with bonus loot to boot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479007-diablo4season8belial.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As players may remember, Belial, the Lord of Lies, came in two distinct forms in Diablo 3. He at first appeared in a smaller, less-intimidating form, before transforming into a massive, kaiju-sized demon unlike anything else in Diablo. Both of Belial's forms will be present in Diablo 4 come Season 8. When players take him on in his own lair, he will be just as oversized as players remember in what Blizzard calls his "supreme" form. But when he appears randomly after defeating another boss, players will encounter him in his lesser form. Defeating him will reward even more loot, adding a cherry on top and another injection of dopamine into Diablo 4's endgame loop.</p><p dir="ltr">"His coolness, nostalgia, and versatility in who he is as one of the great evils was a really fun opportunity that inspired more beyond the initial call to action of 'upgrade the Lair Boss system,'" Nuñez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Finer said just about everybody who makes it to Diablo 4's Torment difficulty will be able to eventually overcome Belial Supreme, as intimidating as he may be. It will be on the game's highest difficulty, Torment 4, where Belial truly becomes a challenge but will offer even better rewards to compensate. Belial will be special in Diablo 4 in that players get to choose which endgame boss loot table they want to pull from as a reward after defeating him, with Belial sporting a much-higher drop chance for coveted Uniques alongside guaranteed Ancestral item rolls, the most powerful items in the game. Considering how Blizzard is ramping up the difficulty in Diablo 4 Season 8 in part by reducing the drop rate of Legendary and Ancestral items, defeating Belial will be a key way to deck out characters in the best gear possible.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</h2><p dir="ltr">It's not just Belial that will prove a challenge. Diablo 4 Season 8 will also introduce two bosses from the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion campaign, Urivar and the Harbinger of Hatred, into the endgame boss rotation. Players may think they know these encounters already, but Nuñez made clear that adding a boss from the campaign into the endgame isn't a "cut and paste" job. In addition to visual changes, the boss fights themselves are in many ways superpowered versions of their story campaign counterparts, with new mechanics inspired by what came before.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's taking inspiration from the main boss, but really amplifying it to the highest creativity of the encounter designer's passion of where they want to take it," Nuñez said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479006" data-ratio="0.5625980545968" data-width="3187" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479006"></a><figcaption>The Harbinger of Hatred boss fight from Vessel of Hatred has been revamped as a Lair Boss.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479006-diablo4season8harbingerofhatred.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The goals of the new Lair Boss system are numerous, Blizzard said. Not only does Blizzard want players to fight a wider variety of more challenging bosses thanks to the loot table changes, but it also wants each boss kill to be more rewarding. Blizzard is keen on having players be able to challenge bosses without having to put up precious materials, but is wanting players to fight bosses and gain access to their rewards less frequently. Making it so players aren't required to put up materials just to fight the boss also freed Blizzard to make them more difficult, so that players will actually have to engage with each boss' mechanics rather than waiting to confront them when they know they are strong enough to one-shot them.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Lair Boss system and its new key mechanic is also there to help reduce bad social experiences players have had with the game's old boss-summoning system by requiring all players have their own key in order to access their personal loot.</p><p dir="ltr">"We noticed the boss summoning flow wasn't conducive to social play that wasn't negative," Finer said about the old boss-summoning system. "We saw a lot of people complaining about leeching. If you hopped into a game, you might have that person, maybe it's Belial on the other side of the screen, saying, 'Yeah, I'm totally going to put up materials to chain boss fight,' but then they don't and they drop out and it's like, 'I can't believe you've done this.'"</p><p dir="ltr">However, Blizzard still wants to encourage players to group up by offering bonus items based on the number of players in a party when fighting bosses, without making grouping feel mandatory. Finer said all the changes are the "culmination of about a year of feedback" about the boss-summoning system, and that reducing the inventory clutter from so many boss-summoning materials makes the entire Lair Boss system far more streamlined.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479008" data-ratio="0.56210191082803" data-width="1884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479008"></a><figcaption>A look at all the changes and features coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 8.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4479008-diablo4season8infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All together, Season 8's Lair Boss system makes for significant changes to Diablo 4's endgame that on paper sound like they will continue to push the game further in the right direction. Whether Season 8 will have as much of an impact as previous game-altering updates like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Loot Reborn</a> remains to be seen, but it's clear Blizzard knows that simply adding a boss or a new seasonal feature doesn't quite move the needle.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we were looking at how we wanted to necessarily go about expanding this feature, we didn't think that adding a new boss to it was enough necessarily," Nuñez said. "We wanted to inject new novel mechanics during the day-to-day of how players actually engage with it."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 8 goes live on April 29. In addition to the new bosses, seasonal boss powers, and the Lair Boss system, Season 8 will also completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/">rework Diablo 4's battle pass into a new system called The Reliquary</a> where players will have more agency over picking their rewards. Blizzard has also revealed the game's first external IP crossover will be with none other than the legendary dark fantasy manga by the late Kentaro Miura, Berserk. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-crossing-over-with-dark-fantasy-manga-series-berserk-for-its-first-ip-collab/1100-6530944/">Diablo 4 Berserk crossover</a>, which is also coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, will begin on May 6.</p>
