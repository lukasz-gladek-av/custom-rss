                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, which quickly became one of Netflix's most popular things <em>ever</em> when it was released on the streaming service earlier this year, is coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on October 2, but this collaboration is way more than just new skins for the item shop. HUNTR/X is taking over Battle Royale, Blitz, and Creative, essentially getting the first week of Fortnitemares to themselves before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">the Halloween party begins in earnest a little later</a>. Take a look at what's in store in the teaser below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ipctlvNePk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In all, Fortnite x KPop Demon Hunters is adding quite a pile of stuff around the Fortnite ecosystem. There are at least three new weapons and items to Battle Royale and Blitz, with Rumi's sword, Mira's Spicy Ramyeon, and a new version of the teleporting void mask. There's Demon Rush, the new KPop Demon Hunters-themed re-do of the limited-time Horde Rush mode, which Epic brings back each October. There are KPop Demon Hunter items and NPCs that can be used for modes designed using Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN), as we've seen previously with Squid Game and The Walking Dead.</p><p>And, yes, there will be skins in the item shop for each member of HUNTR/X. There's been no word about any jam tracks, however.</p><p>October is a busy month for Fortnite. In addition to the Fortnitemares event that is expected to significantly shake up the loot pool in Battle Royale next week, October 2 marks the start of Fortnite OG Season 6, and October 9 marks the beginning of Fortnite Festival Season 11. The new music pass is expected to be full of Fortnite-original stuff instead licensed music and skins like usual--but the KPop Demon Hunters takeover has fans wondering if HUNTR/X might actually be the new season headliners. But there have been no leaks thus far about the upcoming Festival season, so that's pure speculation at this point.</p><p>KPop Demon Hunters is just one of a pretty massive pile of new Fortnite collaborations we're expecting this month.

                <p dir="ltr">Amazon's Luna cloud gaming service, now in its third year, has been a constant part of their Prime lineup, allowing Prime members to stream games at no extra cost right from their PCs or TV sets. Today, the company has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced its plans</a> to overhaul the Luna experience, with new social features and a slew of new games coming to the service later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The main new offering of the Luna redesign is called GameNight, which will offer a collection of multiplayer-focused games that players control with their cell phones. The collection will include adaptations of classic board games like Taboo and Clue, established party games like Exploding Kittens, and new titles like Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg, where players must try to convince Judge Snoop Dogg to rule in their favor by spinning stories and placing the blame on other players.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajawdjs6KKA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The selection of games available to stream on Luna will also increase with the overhaul, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and Dave the Diver among those announced. Luna Premium members will gain access to even more games, including Lego DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, Batman: Arkham Knight, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna fully launched in March 2022, following a "soft launch" trial period that began in October 2020. Subscribers can access Luna on tablets, smartphones, PC, and smart TVs, and they can use any Bluetooth-enabled controller to play streamed games. A Luna controller specifically made for the service was released by Amazon just before the October 2020 soft launch.</p>
