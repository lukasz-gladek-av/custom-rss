                <p>Fortnite's latest edition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnitemares-2025-all-skins-weapons-and-new-map/2900-7125/" data-ref-id="2900-7125">Fortnitemares</a> includes horror icons like Jason, Ghostface, the Scooby Gang, and Doja Cat. The only nonfictional character on that list has already made some waves across social media--or at least the Fortnite X account that was supposedly being run by her.</p><p>Doja Cat was scheduled to take over the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite X account</a> on Wednesday before the release of the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnitemares-2025-a-terrifying-new-cast-of-horror-icons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnitemares announcement</a>, but she says it wasn’t actually her after the account posted a message about "rose toys" that some assume was referencing sex toys. Doja Cat responded directly from her actual account.</p><p>"I told them not to, man. That’s not even me," she wrote on X. "I said this yesterday and then said 'don’t post that' :/."</p><p>The post was quickly taken down afterward, but not before it circulated online. Some things are forever on the internet.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlABOZhCCqU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AlABOZhCCqU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fortnitemares is one of the most beloved events in the Fortnite community. It usually features a number of new iconic skins--including the likes of Billy The Puppet and Leatherface in 2024--as well as fun limited-time modes that give out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnitemares-quests-2025-how-to-get-a-free-fortnite-skin-and-all-rewards/1100-6535338/" data-ref-id="1100-6535338">rewards</a> and experience for playing. The map usually gets a facelift too, with a Halloween flourish added to several named locations.</p><p>2025's edition of Fortnitemares runs from today until the beginning of November.</p>

                <p>The new patch notes are in for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/news/">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-update-buffs-vault-hunters/1100-6535180/" data-ref-id="1100-6535180">and like several other updates</a>, this new round of tweaks to the game is focused on empowering players--specifically, their arsenal of weapons. Gearbox says that it's focusing on smaller gear adjustments, starting with several Legendary-class weapons. These hard-to-find weapons haven't felt as good to use in combat despite having unique perks, so their overall power is getting dialed up substantially.</p><p>One prime example here is the Hellwalker, a Jacobs fire-and-forget shotgun that was introduced in Borderlands 3 and is almost a carbon copy of the Super-Shotgun used by the Doom Slayer in Id's Doom games. This will now do 30% extra base damage, so if you have a Jakobs mod equipped and the right skills activated, it should shred through rank-and-file enemies with ease. Queen's Rest, a pistol manufactured by Torgue, will also start firing rounds faster, as this has been increased by 50%, while the chance for its unique perk to spawn a homing sticky projectile has been increased from 30% to 50%.</p>

      </div>
<p>Other notable changes include damage and fire-rate increases to Ruby's Grasp, the drone deployed from Bully will do 50% more damage, and Convergence base damage has been increased by 25%. If you don't have one of these Legendary-class weapons yet, they can be farmed from bosses found throughout Kairos, or you might want to check Mauricie's Black Market vending machine to see if he has it in stock.</p><p>Maurice offers unique Legendary gear for any player who accesses his machine, so if RNG is on your side, you might be able to purchase one of these upgraded guns with a very desirable roll of stats. You can also take a chance with the Golden Treasure Chests, as these often hand out Legendaries when you open them. To stock up on Golden Keys, check our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">Borderlands 4 Shift Code guide</a> for updates.</p><p>Gearbox has also made a few other changes, like ensuring that the legendary Tediore shotgun Anarchy properly rewards stacks of Mutualism after auto-reloading or killing enemies, and Vex's Bleed skill will now count as status effect damage. You can see the full patch notes below, and next week, Gearbox will upload a patch that focuses on fine-tuning Class Mods, Repkits, Shields, and Firmware. Borderlands 4 has also struggled with performance issues since launch, but Gearbox says next week's update will address these issues and add some highly requested quality-of-life changes.</p><h2>Borderlands 4 Update Notes</h2><h4>Weekly Activities</h4><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b> switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those who take it on.</li><li>The<b> Weekly Wildcard Mission</b> changed.

                <p>If fast progression is what you're looking for in Battlefield 6, then the PlayStation 5 version might be the one to get when the shooter launches tomorrow.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976302633410494652" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, the PS5 version of Battlefield 6 has an XP Modifier that will add 5% of XP in every match in which you're partied up with at least two PlayStation Plus subscribers. A PlayStation Plus membership is required to play online multiplayer in Battlefield 6 (and any paid game).</p><p>A screenshot shared by CharlieIntel on X shows other XP Modifiers, including a 5% boost for simply owning the game and another for just being in a party with other players.</p><p>It appears that these modifiers can stack, meaning that PS5 players who party up with at least two other people playing on PS5 would net a significant 15% XP bonus. That's a hefty advantage over anyone playing on PC or Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-reportedly-reached-a-massive-player-count/1100-6533862/" data-ref-id="1100-6533862">widely played open beta for Battlefield 6</a> in August included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-players-on-ps5-are-getting-an-exclusive-skin/1100-6533792/" data-ref-id="1100-6533792">PS5-exclusive reward</a>: The Advance Party skin, which was a generic dark-colored solider outfit with some blue accents. It wasn't the most exciting bonus, but it was an exclusive nonetheless.</p><p>A console manufacturer striking exclusivity deals for multiplatform games isn't unusual--Sony did it all the time for Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-call-of-duty-mw2-and-warzone-2-playstation-exclusive-content-in-action/1100-6509299/" data-ref-id="1100-6509299">giving PlayStation owners bonus XP modifiers</a> and free content packs.</p><p>With Battlefield 6 launching soon, be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">what time the game will launch</a> in your region and check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">GameSpot's guides for the game</a>.
