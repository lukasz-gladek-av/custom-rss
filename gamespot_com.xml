                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly making a new battle royale game that's inspired by Apex Legends, so much so that the project once used the game as a thumbnail.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft's new battle royale game is codenamed "Scout" and has been in development for a few years already. Its characters are said to be similar to Apex Legends' own Pathfinder, Wraith, and Lifeline, as well as others.</p><p>The company's higher-ups reportedly wants to take advantage of Apex Legends' dwindling player base. As a result, they are said to think that there's now an opportunity to launch another battle royale game. This is despite Ubisoft's internal research team indicating that engagement in battle royale games is on the decline.</p><p>Ubisoft has already entered the battle royale genre with Hyper Scape. However, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-scape-servers-are-shutting-down-april-28-ubisoft-says/1100-6500039/" data-ref-id="1100-6500039">servers were shut down back in April 2022</a>. Ubisoft was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-making-a-hero-shooter-battle-royale/1100-6502182/" data-ref-id="1100-6502182">reportedly making another battle royale game, codenamed Pathfinder</a> (unrelated to the Apex Legends character), but it's unknown whether its related to project Scout in any way.</p><p>Ubisoft attempted to replicate Call of Duty's success with xDefiant, but the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutting down in June</a>. Ubisoft has recently created a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new dedicated subsidiary</a> focusing on its three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cy, and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft is reportedly working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rainbow-six-tactics-game-is-reportedly-in-development/1100-6530655/" data-ref-id="1100-6530655">tactics game set in the Rainbow Six universe</a>.</p><p>As for Apex Legends, EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">teased some sort of "Apex Legends 2.0,"</a> but it still seems a while away.</p>
