                <p>A strange world awaits you in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/" data-ref-id="5000-566112"><strong>The Alters</strong></a>. As Jan Dolski, you have to do everything in your power to make it back home. Fortunately, you can lend yourself a helping hand. By that, we mean that Jan can create clones of himself, each with his own dispositions and attitudes, to aid him on his journey. Of course, things get more convoluted down the line, which is why we have our The Alters guides hub to prepare you for the task at hand.</p><h2>The Alters guides hub</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-tips-survival-beginners-guide/2900-6664/" data-ref-id="2900-6664"><strong>Beginner's guide: 12 tips to help you survive</strong></a> - The Alters is a sci-fi survival game, with key features that involve base building and management. Not only do you need to keep track of your clones and whatever it is that they're doing, but you also have to gather lots of resources, keep your base functioning, handle key objectives, and avoid otherworldly threats in the region. Our beginner's guide has a bunch of tips to help you get started.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-base-building-manage-your-base/1100-6532397/" data-ref-id="1100-6532397"><strong>Base-building and management guide</strong></a> - Your mobile hub can have several modules and rooms, each with a unique function. Still, you have to be mindful of the available space, the total mass, and the materials that you need to construct these improvements. Additionally, you have to consider the jobs that your alter buddies can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-scan-mine-resources-outposts/1100-6532396/" data-ref-id="1100-6532396"><strong>How to scan and mine for resources</strong></a> - This guide for The Alters focuses on a very basic task. That said, the materials that you gather, including metals, organics, minerals, and rapidium, are necessary for crafting and progression.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-characters-happiness-motivation-relations/2900-6666/" data-ref-id="2900-6666"><strong>How to increase character happiness and morale</strong></a> - As Jan Dolski, the copies and clones you create have their own set of beliefs and motivations. They even have their own backstories and life paths. Naturally, you have to keep them happy by finding out what makes them tick and completing the tasks they have for you. Of course, if you can't keep them happy, then you can always keep them in line.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-anomalies-planetary-samples-alx/1100-6532426/" data-ref-id="1100-6532426"><strong>How to destroy Anomalies</strong></a> - These peculiar entities pop up all over the planet. Some are pulsating wisps that stay in place, while others follow you around before exploding. There are even variants that affect time, which can be deadly when you're far away from your base. The good news is that there's a device that can destroy these anomalies. In fact, blasting these things nets you unique resources as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-magnetic-storms-survival/1100-6532427/" data-ref-id="1100-6532427"><strong>How to weather Magnetic Storms</strong></a> - In The Alters, you're not just moving your base to avoid the scorching sun. You also have to mitigate the devastating impact of Magnetic Storms. These planetary disturbances occur periodically, and they can easily wreck your entire base.

                <p>Microsoft's recent openness to bringing its biggest Xbox Series X|S games to PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">a boon for sales</a>. But the benefits for Xbox owners may not go both ways, as a trio of big upcoming Microsoft-published games are skipping physical releases on Xbox Series X|S. PS5 gamers, on the other hand, will be able to get physical editions of all three.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> are the three games in question, as seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCJY74BS,B0FCJHHYZY,B0FCJTVGKZ,B0FCJC4CQJ,B0FCJYV9DY,B0FCJFY734,B0FCHZ55LQ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. But it doesn't appear to be a case of Microsoft favoring PS5 over its own console. Instead, it seems to be part of Microsoft's broader push towards digital-only releases.</p><p>Instead of coming with a physical disc, The Other Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4 will only be packaged with a download code in Series X|S boxes. Strangely enough, Gears of War: Reloaded won't even have that physical option. It's strictly a digital release except on PS5.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that the majority of Xbox game sales are digital. Spencer also said that Microsoft was simply "following what the customers are doing." But the shift away from physical releases appears to be accelerating for Microsoft this year. That may be in part due to the uncertainty over whether the gaming industry will be seriously affected by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p><p>Of the three games, Gears of War: Reloaded will be released first on August 26 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Ninja Gaiden 4 and The Outer Worlds 2 will follow on all three platforms on October 20 and October 29, respectively. Brandon Adler, the game director of The Outer Worlds 2, recently shared his response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">Microsoft setting the price for that sequel at $80</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic Games surprised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> fans on Friday when it <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1933515577580024139" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that the next update, which was slated to introduce Season 9 of Fortnite Festival next Tuesday, has been delayed. Fortunately, the delay is about as short as it can get, as the patch has been pushed back just one day to Wednesday, June 18. Epic gave no reason for the delay.</p><p>The move is a surprising one, as it's rare for a patch to be delayed in advance by just a day. Normally, Epic doesn't openly discuss patch timing--it just deploys it when it's ready with half a day's notice. This patch gets a public acknowledgement of its delay because it comes with the new Festival season launch, which has been scheduled for June 17 for months. The delay means that the current Sabrina Carpenter pass <a href="https://x.com/FNFestStatus/status/1933516051834094022" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be extended</a> by one day.</p><p>Usually when a patch gets bumped from Tuesday to Wednesday it's because that week's Monday was a holiday--Epic doesn't deploy big updates when its employees aren't in the office. While June 16 is not a US holiday, there is one later in the week: Juneteenth, on Thursday. It could be that Epic is observing the holiday early instead of during the middle of the week.</p><p>While Season 9 of Fortnite Festival was long rumored to have Daft Punk as its headlining act, it's now looking as though the featured artist will actually be Deadmau5. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">the new superhero season</a> began in Battle Royale on June 7, the updated map included <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931444514658422923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadmau5 posters</a>, similar to the way Epic teased Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter ahead of their season launches. While it's not yet confirmed that Deadmau5 is headlining, he's by far the most plausible candidate right now.</p>
