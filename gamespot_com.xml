                <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> would release on September 4 was such a surprise that even the most tuned-in Hollow Knight fans were in shock at the news. And now, just days before Silksong releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is seeing a renaissance with gamers, passing its Steam concurrents records over and over again, hitting a new peak of 56,192 players on August 29, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>For years, Hollow Knight's biggest day was in May of 2022 when the game had over 20,000 concurrent players. Since the announcement of Silksong's impending release date, though, each consecutive day has seen that concurrent peak rising, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">hit 21,000 on August 22</a>, just a day after the announcement, and hit 56,192 today. For a seven-year-old indie game, this is pretty big.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that SteamDB is not the be-all-end-all of game stats. Steam is a dominant platform for sure, but Hollow Knight is available on all last and current-generation consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch being a particularly popular platform for the game. Even so, it's indicative that the legend of Hollow Knight continues to grow.</p><p>We got a sneak peek last week, and signs are looking good. "Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p>
