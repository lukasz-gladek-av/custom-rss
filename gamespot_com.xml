                <p>If there's one thing we all love in fantasy games, it's wizards who are also animals. It's the one universal, very specific truth about gamers. So when the Gamescom Opening Night Live pre-show debuted a new trailer featuring a wizard who is also a frog, our hearts were all a-flutter. Oh and it also revealed the game is releasing on October 9, but <em>focus</em>, people.</p><p>In the story trailer we saw one of the outcasts, the recently revealed Cider, rescuing an adorable frog baby, before starting to get overwhelmed by imperial forces. Then the frog mage intervened, and boy, was he pissed that these armies are threatening a frog baby. Mess them up, frog man!</p><p>The trailer ended with the October release date, and included the key art update with the new playable character. That brings the total revealed roster so far up to four, and new characters keep getting added to the key art as they're revealed.</p><p>Absolum is from Dotemu, the studio behind Streets of Rage 4. It takes place in a new fantasy world, and it fuses beat-'em-up action with roguelike elements to let you grow stronger after each run, making your fighters that much more capable every time. It's coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

The trailer also shows a customization menu, where players can spend yarn collected in the world on new costumes for Bubsy--including a look mimicking Bubsy 3D.</p><p>This is the first new entry in the Bubsy franchise since Bubsy: Paws On Fire in 2019.
