                <p>Peter Connelly, the video game composer and sound designer on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-starring-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12865716/" data-ref-id="2200-12865716">Tomb Raider Remaster series</a> and Tomb Raider: Chronicles, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for fraudulently applying for a government COVID-19 support loan. Based in Peterlee, County Durham, Connelly obtained a second Bounce Back Loan (BBL) of £37,500 (approximately $55,000) in June 2020 by greatly overstating his company's turnover. This was in direct violation of the loan rules, which only permitted one loan per business. He had already secured a legitimate loan of £22,000 the previous month.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Insovlency Service</a>, Connelly claimed his company had a 2019 turnover of £150,000 when, in reality, it had earned just over £58,000. Additionally, he falsely claimed that he had not previously applied for a BBL. His actions led to a criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service, the body responsible for monitoring misuse of the COVID loans.</p><p>At a hearing this week, Connelly was sentenced not only to prison but also disqualified from serving as a company director for six years. The Insolvency Service emphasized the seriousness of his fraud, noting that this sort of loan was created to support struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to be exploited for personal gain. Chief Investigator David Snasdell condemned Connelly’s "blatant disregard" for the rules.</p><p>In his defense, Connelly stated that he had undertaken financial risks to work on a high-profile project involving the reimagining of the Tomb Raider soundtrack. He claimed to have sold his car and taken out personal loans in anticipation of the project's success, which he also claimed was sidelined by the pandemic. However, the court ruled that his financial mismanagement did not excuse committing fraud.</p><p>His company, Peter Connelly Limited, entered liquidation in August 2021, with neither of the two loans repaid. In June 2022, Connelly entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), agreeing to repay his debts through regular payments to an insolvency agency.</p>

Aside from the modern remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-delayed-to-2024-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop/1100-6516795/" data-ref-id="1100-6516795">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, that was released in 2024, there hasn't been much happening with the franchise. Now, Lollipop Chainsaw is poised for a comeback with "new projects" thanks to a deal between Dragami Games and Nada Holdings.</p><p>The two companies jointly announced that they plan to "jointly launch multiple new projects" based on Lollipop Chainsaw. Neither Dragami nor Nada offered any details about what those projects might entail, but a new game or a potential film adaptation could be among the options explored.</p><p>Dragami Games president and CEO Shohei Sato thanked Lollipop Chainsaw fans for their support and praised Nada for giving the company a chance to revisit the franchise.</p><p>"The team at Nada Holdings shares a deep affection and enthusiasm for the title, along with a proven track record in IP investment and development," said Sato. "Through this partnership, we look forward to working together to create new projects that carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise."</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suda51-and-james-gunn-wont-be-involved-in-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake/1100-6505128/" data-ref-id="1100-6505128">neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the 2024 remaster</a>. If another game moves forward, it's unclear if either Gunn or Suda51 will be willing or able to contribute to it.</p>

While Steam only counts for a portion of the game's audience--it's also available through the Epic Games Store, as well as on Xbox Series X|S and PS5--the numbers haven't been too encouraging lately. The game peaked with 1,992 players on launch day, and since then, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">those numbers have fallen</a> to well under 100 concurrent players on average.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Remedy says that one of the issues it looks to address is the opening of the game, as that crucial first hour has become a point of criticism amongst the playerbase. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved," Remedy explained.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The company says that it plans to improve the narrative onboarding experience by placing an introductory video into the game and improving the tutorial section with better pop-up tips. In effect, this should help players figure out "where they are, who they are, and what they are trying to achieve" as members of Firebreak.</p><p>In terms of gameplay, Remedy explained that it wants to strike a fine balance between using old-fashioned first-person shooter gunplay and Crisis Kit tools to triumph, giving players more control over their growth. This will involve adding three new heavy guns, dropping all "generic" upgrades from equipment and replace it with a Mod System that lets players tweak how their weapons function.</p><p>Other changes on the horizon include tweaks to the Jobs system and a dynamic series of objectives to keep players on their toes. "We're bringing in a new handcrafted level, three Zones, a new status effect, two more enemies to deal with, and all the rest you've come to expect from a new Job," Remedy added.</p><p>The studio stressed that its plans aren't set in stone and could change over time, but overall, it expects the first Major Update to introduce a significant number of improvements to FBC: Firebreak. Remedy has been fairly candid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-bringing-major-changes-to-fbc-firebreak-after-launch-backlash/1100-6532591/" data-ref-id="1100-6532591">with the response</a> to its three-player cooperative shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/" data-ref-id="1100-6532823">and while it did hope for a better launch</a>, it says that it remains fully committed to improving and evolving the game.</p>

                <p>Netflix plans to "ramp up" its investment in gaming after the company previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">pulled back from its grand ambitions in the AAA space</a> and shut down a studio from Halo veteran Joe Staten.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_Transcript.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix's latest earnings briefing</a>, co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peters commented on Netflix's vision for gaming, saying Netflix's investment thus far has been relatively small in comparison to the money it puts into film, TV, and live sports programming. The opportunity to grow is significant, he said.</p><p>"We look at the near-term monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we've looked at other new content categories. You can think in scripted or film or on and on. And that's essentially, if we deliver more value to our offering, we get increased user acquisition, we get increased retention, we get increased willingness to pay," he said. "So it drives all of the sort of core fundamentals of our business."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463" data-ratio="0.61573033707865" data-width="890" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463"></a><figcaption>Netflix Games is growing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg"></figure><p>Peters said Netflix has already observed "positive effects" of investing in gaming. However, he reminded people that Netflix's investment in gaming remains "small" relative to the company's overall business and that the number of people playing games on Netflix is small as well. In 2022, findings found that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">99% of Netflix users did not play Netflix's games</a>, though this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">before Grand Theft Auto came to Netflix. </a></p><p>Peters said Netflix is aiming to be "disciplined" with regards to its investment in gaming. The goal, he said, is to not invest too much before Netflix can demonstrate that it can create "value for our members."</p><p>"We've seen good progress, as you know, with licensed games like GTA. We've seen good progress with the games we developed like Squid Game: Unleashed. So you'll see more from us in both of those categories, as well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think that we're either in a unique or differential position to deliver," he said. "So we're super excited to roll those out over the next year."</p><p>Currently, Netflix's games are included with a subscription to the streaming service, and Netflix's games do not have ads or microtransactions. Some have theorized that Netflix might seek to monetize games in different ways in the future, but nothing is confirmed yet. Peters said Netflix is "open" to "evolving our monetization model" for games, but he said the company needs to "get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. So we're going to do that work first."</p><p>Finally, Peters said people should remember that the TAM, or total addressable market, for gaming is "very, very large" and thus has significant potential upside in terms of growth and revenue. "We remain convicted about our strategic opportunity and excited to make more progress," Peters said.</p><p>Also during the briefing, Netflix management said the company continues to invest in "immersive, narrative games based on our IP." For Black Mirror Season 7, Netflix launched the game Thronglets, which was also featured in the "Plaything" episode. The Squid Game: Unleashed game, meanwhile, received new content themed around the recently released Season 3.</p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Netflix gaming boss Alain Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">why Netflix shuttered its AAA studio and canceled the new game from Staten</a>, Tascan said this wasn't a signal that Netflix doesn't want to make "big ambitious games." Instead, he said the genre of what the studio was building was not "matching the platform."</p><p>"This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise," he said.</p><p>In other Netflix news, it was just recently announced that Netflix had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlit a live-action Assassin's Creed TV series that has been in the works for a half-decade already.</a></p>

This coincides with Microsoft also closing the curtain on its longrunning operating system, with Square Enix adding that players will still be able to "likely" play the game after this date.</p><p>"We have found that continuing support for this operating system is a difficult proposition," <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix said in a statement</a>. "You will likely be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems even after the end of support. However, after we discontinue support, we will, as a general rule, no longer be able to provide support for problems arising as a result of the operating system."</p><p>The publisher says that it may still respond to requests for technical support, but on a case-by-case basis. Final Fantasy 14 first launched for PC in 2013--PS3--back in 2013, which was when Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system was still in its infancy. Due to its long shelf life, it has naturally been updated for multiple Windows OS versions since then, and its recent Dawntrail expansion provided the game with a graphical update.</p><p>Regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/" data-ref-id="2900-5436">best MMORPGs of all time</a>, the game was ported to Xbox Series X|S last year.
