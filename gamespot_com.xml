                <p dir="ltr">A fun myth to hear about relates to a friend's uncle working at Nintendo to get the scoop on secrets. But what if your buddy's aunt actually did work at Valve, and his CD-burning gifts to you sparked Valve's utilization of DRM decades ago? That's apparently what happened, according to former Valve chief marketing officer Monica Harrington.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a> reports that Harrington told the unlikely Valve DRM origin story featuring her 19-year-old nephew at the Game Developers Conference. "At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue," Harrington said. "My own nephew had just used a $500 check I'd sent him for school expenses and bought himself a CD-ROM replicator, so he sent me a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that CDs were the distribution model for PC games decades ago, before digital storefronts existed. So the fact someone could easily rip a game and share unlimited copies with friends was a threat to companies. As such, Harrington credits her nephew's antics for sparking Valve to act with a DRM strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because of gamers like my nephew, we implemented an authentication scheme," said Harrington. "Customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon gamers were flooding message boards, and they were saying, 'The game doesn't work.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Harrington added that Valve co-founder (and her ex-husband) Mike Harrington remembers it a bit differently, as he believes the company was working on DRM already. But Monica Harrington stresses that she was making a big deal about an authentication system to everyone at Valve after hearing about what her nephew did.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the only story Monica Harrington shared about Valve's early days at GDC. She also discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dramatic-half-life-deal-that-altered-the-fate-of-valve-forever/1100-6530291/">the dramatic Half-Life deal that altered the fate of the company forever</a>. Meanwhile, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-seemingly-bans-all-steam-games-that-require-watching-advertisements-to-play/1100-6529356/">Valve seemingly banned any games that required watching paid advertisements to play</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Valve's digital storefront <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/">Steam broke a new concurrent-players record with over 41.2 million users</a>.</p>

                <p>A Nintendo Direct is reportedly set to air sometime this week, right before the scheduled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1904275415075606643?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insider NateTheHate2</a>, the Direct will be on or around Thursday, but but he is not sure if it will be formatted like a traditional Nintendo Direct or something like an Indie World Showcase.

Not everyone will be early adopters of Switch 2, and analysts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-wont-sell-as-well-as-original-due-in-part-to-backward-compatibility-analyst/1100-6530136/" data-ref-id="1100-6530136">predict that it won't sell as well as its predecessor</a>.

                <p>Just a week after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> appears to be the success story that Ubisoft is in need of right now. Just hours after it arrived, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-impressive-milestone-in-just-one-day/1100-6530275/">Ubisoft confirmed that 1 million people were playing the game</a>, and after the crucial first weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">that figure jumped to 2 million players</a>. One of the big metrics that the game has been judged by is its concurrent players on Steam, and while it hasn't yet surpassed the numbers set by 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, that might be an unfair comparison to make.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a Ubisoft source revealed that Shadows was responsible for the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the Assassin's Creed franchise, while Valhalla held onto its top spot. According to the internal email shown to IGN, 27% of Shadows' total "activations" were on PC--covering various distribution channels on that platform--with Steam playing a major role as this was the first Assassin's Creed game in several years to launch day-one through that storefront.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1691647879" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Ubisoft also noted that player engagement is at "record levels" and feedback across "moderated, verified platforms" remains very positive.</p><p>Overall, Shadows is off to a good start, and while it doesn't match or exceed several records set by Valhalla, Ubisoft did note that the 2020 Assassin's Creed game benefitted from a "perfect storm" of conditions. This was during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic when people were forced to stay and work from home, and with the launch of the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles, more people turned to video games for entertainment.</p><p>Other crucial factors here include Shadows launching in March--several previous entries were released during the lucrative Q4 period--the lack of an early access period as a selling point, and the premium tier of Ubisoft's monthly subscription service offering Shadows as part of its gaming library. Ubisoft+ is also available directly on Xbox consoles, which makes it more challenging to properly compare the sales of Shadows to other recent games in the franchise.</p><p>"Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions--in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware," the internal memo read. "It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That's why it's more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage--games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above."</p><p>The reported success of Shadows arrives at a crucial time for Ubisoft, as last year's Star Wars Outlaws underperformed and saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/">company stock sink to its worst figure in a decade</a>. Recently, there have also been reports that Ubisoft and its individual franchises might be up for sale, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/">Microsoft, and EA</a> possibly preparing to make a deal.</p>

                <p>Over five years ago, Paradox Interactive announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-a-revival-o/1100-6465762/" data-ref-id="1100-6465762">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-awaited sequel to 2004's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-review/1900-6113468/" data-ref-id="1900-6113468">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>. As the game faced multiple delays and switched developers, fans had to wait even longer. But now, the World of Darkness looks a little brighter and Bloodlines 2 may be arriving soon.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has given Bloodlines 2 an M rating</a>, which could mean that a release date announcement will come soon. The only details about the story from the ESRB's description are that players will be tasked with helping two vampires regain their memories and lost powers while facing an uprising among the undead.</p><p>Bloodlines 2's Mature rating appears to largely be due to the game's combat, which allows players to violently dispatch enemies using physical and vampiric powers. Beheadings, claw-slashing, and snapping necks are all options, and player-characters will be able to feed on human NPCs to sustain themselves. Somewhat humorously, the ESRB also shared a few samples of the game's sexually suggestive dialogue.</p><p>The game will put players in control of an elder vampire whom they can customize to determine the character's gender and appearance, as well as their vampire clan and special abilities. Bloodlines 2's developer, The Chinese Room, previously disclosed that players will also be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-bloodlines-2-will-make-you-a-pain-in-the-neck/1100-6527046/" data-ref-id="1100-6527046">find human NPCs whom they can romance</a>. But even if fans choose to play their vampires as lovers, they still need to drink blood to survive.</p><p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, has discussed the "sometimes sick pleasure" of working on the post-apocalyptic series and how "storytelling is cathartic" when the real world is undergoing change and upheaval as it is today.</p><p>"There's a very healthy and sometimes sick pleasure in that kind of catharsis and a safe space to see human relationships under crisis and in pain and intelligently draw a political allegory, societal allegory, and base it off of the world that we're living in," he said, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-1236346870/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also during the call with reporters, Pascal discussed why he's excited to see The Last of Us come back for its second season, after the first was such a hit.</p><p>"I think there's something really exciting about giving everyone another season of a show that everyone loved and that everyone has worked so hard on and has put so much into," he said.</p><p>Pascal, who previously starred in HBO's Game of Thrones, returns for Season 2 in his starring role as Joel. He's joined by Bella Ramsey as Ellie, while Kaitlyn Dever joins the Season 2 cast as Abby.
