                <p>Following its week post-launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has its first patch of fixes, which will help with many of the environmental and audio issues currently in the game. The free-to-play online shooter pits some of Marvel's biggest guns--pun intended--against each other to take down Dr. Doom and Doom 2099. Patch 1 handles a lot of on-the-surface issues, but affects a few heroes including Dr. Strange. You can check out the full list below.</p><p>The big issue that was addressed involved players getting stuck on certain maps after being hit close to the edge. However, as the bug happens across multiple maps and areas, it might still be an issue elsewhere now.</p><p>"However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue," the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent blog post</a> read. "So we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again."</p><p>The general minor bugs NetEase managed to resolve completely were issues like removing a lag when dealing with playing back highlights and recordings. There were also some textual errors, with more fixes on the way in a future update. Some common crash issues were also fixed, especially when dealing with saving Highlights. After the game crashes, the game had a chance to freeze for a long time before closing, but now the game will close after crashing.</p><p>Other small fixes include properly showing heroes' equipped costumes after joining a Quick Match as a replacement, and displaying mission progress correctly on the Season Event screen.</p><p>There were also minor console and PC issues that were resolved. On PC, when using FSR 3 frame-generation technology to modify the resolution, it could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. For PlayStation, when players have the Scarlet Spider costume equipped, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. Both issues have been resolved.</p><h3>Maps and Game Modes:</h3><ul><li>On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. That particular issue was mostly fixed, but as it happens in multiple stages, it could still happen somewhere else now.</li><li>In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Birnin T'Challa: The fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield, during Competitive play, if a player was KOâ€™d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lighting to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument, when the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.</li></ul><h3>Heroes</h3><ul><li>When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">No longer are YouTube Playables titles relegated to solo experiences. Google has revealed that it's testing out multiplayer functionality for the free games library, which is found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playables" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube website</a> or in the app.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&amp;msgid=312398093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> is seeing how real-time multiplayer works with two Playables titles: Ludo Club and Magic Tile 3. The former is similar to the Sorry board game and can be played with three other people from around the world. There is even simple chat functionality, such as selecting an angry emoji or saying, "Hello." This new feature works in browsers and on mobile devices, and Google teases there is more stuff on the way for Playables, too.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-is-testing-out-playable-games/1100-6517522/" data-ref-id="1100-6517522">YouTube first rolled out Playables to select users</a> in September 2023. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-introduces-new-playables-game-library/1100-6523785/" data-ref-id="1100-6523785">YouTube formally introduced the Playables games library</a> with over 75 titles for people to play. No downloading is required to check out games like Angry Birds Showdown, Cut the Rope, and Gin Rummy. YouTube will automatically save your progress, meaning you can return to a title wherever you left off.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, this isn't Google's first foray into gaming. In early 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">Google Stadia was officially shut down</a> after an ambitious initiative as a cloud-gaming service. Before that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-is-shutting-down-its-game-studios-impacting-150-people-including-jade-raymond/1100-6486978/" data-ref-id="1100-6486978">Google shut down game studios</a> that it started and acquired to support Stadia.</p>
