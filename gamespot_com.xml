                <p>It was the Pokemon World Championships over the weekend, and with that means plenty of announcements. If you're a bit of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> aficionado, then you'll probably be excited to hear that Mega Evolution will be coming to the mobile card-collecting game later this fall. The Pokemon Company shared a trailer announcing the news, where it also showed off three Mega Pokemon cards that will be available to pull whenever the set drops.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is the "ever-fluffy" Mega Altaria. This one is a psychic-type card with 190HP, and it has just one move, Mega Harmony, which does a minimum of 40 damage, and increases by 30 points for every benched Pokemon you have.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the "ghastly" Mega Gyarados, a water-type card with 210HP, and again a singular move, Mega Blaster. This move deals 140 damage, and your opponent has to discard the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, there's Mega Blaziken, a fire-type card which also has 210HP, and uses the move Mega Burning, which deals 120 damage. You can also discard one fire energy card from it to burn your opponent's active Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Mega Pokemon also comes with a Mega Evolution EX rule, which states that when your Mega Evolved Pokemon card is knocked out, your opponent gets three points.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no word on when the Mega Evolution season will kick off outside of this fall, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also announced during this year's Pokemon Worlds that next year's championships <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-will-be-the-main-vgc-game-at-the-pokemon-world-championships-in-2026/1100-6534029/">will use the upcoming Pokemon Champions instead of any of the main series games</a>. As well as that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/" data-ref-id="1100-6534031">getting a new mode that sees four players battling each other at the same time</a>.</p>

                <p>Although Pokemon battles have been traditionally fought between two Pokemon trainers, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is increasing the number with a new mode.</p><p dir="ltr">A new trailer introduces the Z-A Battle Club, a mode that pits up to four players in free-for-all battles. The trainer who defeats the most Pokemon in three minutes is crowned the winner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y30vuKRtYPw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer is set in an arena in Lumiose City at nighttime and gives an idea of the different tactics players can have and how fortunes can quickly change within the time limit. Just like the core Pokemon Legends experience, battles take place in real-time, so there are power-up items around the arena that players can run and collect, or you can choose to play it safe, or go on the offensive.</p><p dir="ltr">As the match progresses, it's also possible Pokemon to undergo a Mega Evolution and unleash more powerful attacks, which can be effective on multiple Pokemon. Trainers whose Pokemon have fainted can still make a comeback by switching out Pokemon. The video concludes with a Dragonite that Mega-Evolves in the last ten seconds of the match before unleashing a move so powerful it knocks out three opponents at once to clinch the win.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch on October 16, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 console launch bundle</a> also available to preorder for $500.</p><p dir="ltr">At a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A hands-on</a>, we said, "It seems like a solid foundation that will give players a new way to experience Pokemon battles that have become so familiar.</p>

      </div>
<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced features overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates, although no new gameplay content has been confirmed. The original release did however have three pieces of DLC, including an additional story quest.</p><p>The enhancements confirmed for the new release include:</p><ul><li>Enhanced graphics and performance: sharpter textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.</li><li>4K texture uplift including for environments and characters.</li><li>DLSS/FSR support for supported platforms to enable upscaled graphics while maintaing smooth performance.</li><li>Increased NPC density. In particular, the city village of Niaowu will feature more characters populating the streets.</li><li>The option to play with a classic camera mode, based on the system in Shenmue 1 and 2. In the original games, you moved Ryo with the d-pad, while the left stick was for moving the camera from behind him, while holding the right trigger allows you to look freely in first-person.</li><li>Gameplay tweaks, including optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers to reduce the grind for progressing the story.</li><li>Option for skipping cutscenes and dialogue, while expanding the QTE timing window.</li><li>Menus will include helpful purchases alerted while navigation is also being streamlined.</li></ul><p>While the above quality-of-life improvements address some criticisms of the game, it will also be possible to toggle these changes so that the original experience of Shenmue 3 is preserved.</p><p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced marks a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-chapter-for-shenmue-3-has-been-teased/1100-6527913/" data-ref-id="1100-6527913">"new chapter"</a> for the game teased by Inin Games and Ys Net after they announced that they received the publishing rights for Shenmue 3 from previous publisher Deep Silver last year.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shenmue-3-review-from-a-forgotten-time/1900-6417374/" data-ref-id="1900-6417374">Shenmue 3 review</a>, we said, "Shenmue 3 is certainly an interesting game thrown out of time, but that doesn't mean that it's always enjoyable to play."</p>

                <p>The Pokemon Company is making some big changes when it comes to the video game series' world championships. Over the weekend, the latest Worlds tournament took place in California, and as is usual for the event a number of announcements were made. The biggest one for the Pokemon Video Game Championships is that the upcoming pseudo-spin-off game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-champions/">Pokemon Champions</a> will be the main game at next year's Pokemon World Championships. On top of that, the game was also finally confirmed to be releasing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A trailer announcing this news also revealed that Mega Evolution will feature in the "first set of regulations for Ranked Battles in Pokemon Champions." There was also a teaser for a new in-game device called the Omni Ring, which you can check out on Pokemon Champions' <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>. This will seemingly let you rotate between Mega Evolution and other similar abilities in the series like Z-Moves and Dynamaxing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOstmYXLVs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rDOstmYXLVs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-announced-for-switch-and-mobile/1100-6529752/">back in February</a>, details on Pokemon Champions are still pretty light overall. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pokemon-champions-official-overview-trailer/2300-6466201/" data-ref-id="2300-6466201">overview trailer from last month</a> did go into a little bit of detail about the game. It showed a bit about how you can recruit Pokemon, how you can change their stats, and the kinds of battles that will be available. You'll also be able to connect the game to Pokemon Home, and there's cross-platform support between the original Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2, and mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">A release date hasn't been set in stone just yet, but it is planned for release sometime in 2026 on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 iOS, and Android. Let's just hope it lives up to its potential of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-could-unlock-the-best-part-of-pokemon-for-everyone/1100-6534027/" data-ref-id="1100-6534027">making the competitive scene accessible for everyone</a>.</p>
