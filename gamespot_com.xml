                <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct briefing</a>, Nintendo and Oink Games announced Chillin by the Fire, a new game launching today where you chill by the fire.</p><p>Anyone who has ever sat around with friends by a fire knows how peaceful and enjoyable that experience can be, and the game aims to replicate those good vibes. But you cannot just sit there, as players have to closely monitor the flow of air and moisture of firewood to ensure a smooth, consistent, and enjoyable burn. Chillin by the Fire also supports the Switch 2's GameShare feature, so players can sync up with friends and chill by the fire, with their real faces displayed on screen.</p><p>There are "Campfire Convo" prompts for multiplayer to help get people talking. One of prompts shown in the video was, "Hey, by the way, is there a place that makes a sound you love?"</p><p>Of course, no campfire session would be complete without roasting marshmallows, and Chillin by the Fire supports that as well, with players able to rotate their marshmallow to their desired level of crisp.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKrZUZCDRaA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are three modes in Chillin by the Fire, the first of which is "normal." The aim here is to simply grow your fire. Then there is "Survival," which gives players a limited supply of firewood. The third mode is "Playground," and this is a multiplayer mode where up to four people race to build the biggest fire.</p><p>The game features support for HDR to help the orange glow of the fire shine brighter and more realistically. Chillin by the Fire is out today on the Nintendo eShop for $15.</p><p>The July Nintendo Direct included other announcements, including Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection and Once Upon a Katamari, along with details about the Switch versions of Madden 26, Apex Legends, and Just Dance 2026, among others. Check out the gallery below to see all the big reveals.</p>
