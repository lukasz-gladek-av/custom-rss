                <p dir="ltr">There might be toilets in Borderlands 4, but the game's narrative director loathes the idea of this leading to skibidi jokes. This is all part of trying to cut back on the "overabundance of toilet humor" from Borderlands 3, according to Sam Winkler.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> noticed that the Borderlands 4 narrative director was discussing the tone of the upcoming game <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868768937259024578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1868768937259024578%7Ctwgr%5E77b8f2165c794d8918dcfac9811a7dbb09f4244e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fborderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>.

"I'm not gonna say there's no toilets, but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch, I'm gonna cry real tears," said Winkler.

                <p>Disney Speedstorm is finally starting to get characters from Moana, with the addition of the demigod Maui as a playable racer. The trailer shows off the Speedstorm makeover for the character with his own racing suit and themed car, along with a handful of his special moves.</p><p>As you might expect, Maui is a Trickster class. Tricksters have more Boost than other classes, and can gain nitro fuel by drifting. They also tend to get skills like Hack or Bomb. Maui's unique skill is called Hero to All. The standard version uses his magical fishhook to deliver a huge explosion, while in the charged version, he shapeshifts into a hawk to counterattack and speed past opponents.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney Speedstorm - Exclusive Maui Racer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The trailer notes that Maui is available now, and teases that Moana herself will be coming soon too. Like Maui, she appears to have gotten her own Speedstorm makeover and car, with a similar appearance to Maui's. Her skills were not detailed in this trailer.</p><p>Disney Speedstorm is a kart racer featuring characters from across a wide swath of Disney properties--the Mickey Mouse family of characters, animated films like Frozen and Toy Story, live-action movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, and even tangential properties like the Muppets. New seasons rotate in roughly every month, and the current season features five characters from The Incredibles films: Mr. Incredible, Mrs. Incredible, Violet, Dash, and Frozone.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red finally shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">a new teaser featuring Ciri</a> as a fully fledged Witcher on her own adventure. And while there wasn't much time for fun and frivolity in that preview, the developers are hinting that the card game Gwent will be featured in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Gosia Mitręga were asked about Gwent's presence in The Witcher 4 during their joint interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw&amp;t=635s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Allies</a>. While neither Kalemba nor Mitrega came right out and said Gwent is in the game, they certainly seemed to confirm it.</p><p>"We really love [Gwent], and we also really carefully, always listen to the community⁠--which we love--and it's an amazing one. But I don't think anyone will be disappointed," said Mitrega. "It's a part of the experience, absolutely," agreed Kalema. "We also love Gwent."</p><p>Gwent was featured extensively in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and its popularity among players led CD Projekt Red to release a standalone title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gwent-review-heart-of-the-cards/1900-6417024/" data-ref-id="1900-6417024">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>. Near the beginning of December, Hachette Boardgames UK and No Loading Games announced plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">release Gwent as a physical tabletop game</a> with a deck of 400 cards and a playmat. It's expected to be released in late 2025.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and CD Projekt Red only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and officially began production. Kalemba also shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a scene-by-scene breakdown of the teaser trailer</a>, which sheds more light on Ciri's actions and dropped hints about a potentially different outcome than the one fans witnessed in the preview. </p>

Ciri had a big role role the third game, and as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser for The Witcher 4</a>, she's going to be the main character in the next title. However, sharp-eared players may have already picked up on the fact that CD Projekt Red has recast Ciri for her upcoming starring role.</p><p>CD Projekt Red confirmed <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>'s report that Irish actress Ciara Berkeley voiced Ciri in the teaser trailer, and she will portray the heroine in The Witcher 4 as well. Jo Wyatt previously voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3 and its DLC. Berkeley only has a handful of credits to her name, including the TV miniseries Swing Bout, The Deceived, and Normal People. A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told The Gamer that "Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p><p>There may potentially be other parts that are recast in the game, but Doug Cockle will be back as Ciri's mentor Geralt. Earlier this summer, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">confirmed that Geralt will be a part of the next game</a>, although he later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">walked back his comments</a> shortly before the teaser reveal at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>. Geralt's voice was heard at the end of the teaser that streamed during the ceremony, but not in the standalone trailer on YouTube.</p><p>The Witcher 4 game director Sebastian Kalemba recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a breakdown of the first teaser</a>, which included details about the monster that Ciri was hunting as well as the young woman that she was trying to save. The scenes that played out in the trailer will be a part of The Witcher 4's narrative, and Kalemba hinted that players may be able to change the outcome in Ciri's favor.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't announced a release date for The Witcher 4 yet.</p>
