                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> was one of the big hits from 2025, and Embark isn't going to let that momentum wane in 2026. The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.</p><p>"There are going to be multiple maps coming this year," said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/there-are-going-to-be-multiple-maps-coming-this-year-arc-raiders-dev-teases-2026-roadmap-and-maybe-some-new-maps-even-grander-than-what-weve-got-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now."</p><p>Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that "the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there."</p><p>As for the Arc Raiders content roadmap, Watkins suggested that it will be released "sometime soon." In the meantime, he confirmed that Embark is working on new weapons, objectives, and enemies in addition to the maps.</p><p>Embark has also shared details and stats about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-threw-a-lot-of-snowballs-in-the-cold-snap-event/1100-6537434/" data-ref-id="1100-6537434">recently concluded Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders</a>. According to Embark's numbers, 91 million players were knocked out by snowballs, but just under 11,000 enemies were taken out the same way.</p><p>To date, Arc Raiders has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-get-this-free-pickaxe-as-game-passes-12-million-copies-sold/1100-6537346/" data-ref-id="1100-6537346">passed 12.4 million in sales</a>, it has earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in revenue. Earlier this week, the latest Arc Raiders update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-nerfs-weapons-and-introduces-abyss-cosmetics/1100-6537384/" data-ref-id="1100-6537384">nerfed some weapons and introduced new cosmetics</a>.</p>

                <p>There are few things more important in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">all Hytale weapons</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_armor_in_Hytale">How to craft armor in Hytale</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165" data-ratio="0.53521126760563" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165"></a><figcaption>A character donning some rare armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg"></figure><p>If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><p>Before you rush into trying to craft armor, though, you'll need the right Workbench. All armor can be crafted at an Armorer's Workbench, but some higher-tier armor requires a tier two or tier three Armorer's Workbench. You can find out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">how build the Armorer's Workbench</a> and upgrade it to higher tiers in our previous guide.</p><h2 id="All_armor_crafting_recipes_in_Hytale">All armor crafting recipes in Hytale</h2><p>You can find every single crafting recipe for all types of armor in Hytale. We've broken up the armor by its category and then listed the crafting recipe for all armor pieces in that category.</p><p><strong>Helm </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Helm</strong> - 6x Copper Ingots, 2x Plant Fibers</li><li><strong>Iron Helm</strong> - 9x Iron Ingots, 4x Light Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Helm</strong> - 11x Thorium Ingots, 4x Medium Leathers, 4x Linen Scraps, 2x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Helm</strong> - 12x Cobalt Ingots, 4x Heavy Leathers, 4x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Helm</strong> - 15x Adamantite Ingots, 5x Heavy Leathers, 4x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Helm</strong> - 12x Mithril Ingots, 4x Storm Leathers, 40x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p><strong>Gauntlets</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Gauntlets</strong><b> </b>- 5x Copper Ingots, 1x Plant Fiber</li><li><b>Iron Gauntlets </b>- 7x Iron Ingots, 3x Light Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Gauntlets</strong> - 9x Thorium Ingots, 3x Medium Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps, 1x Venom Sac</li><li><strong>Cobalt Gauntlets</strong> - 8x Cobalt Ingots, 3x Heavy Leathers, 3x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Gauntlets</strong> - 12x Adamantite Ingot, 4x Heavy Leather, 3x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Gauntlets</strong> - 24x Mithril Ingots, 2x Storm Leathers, 20x Essences of the Void</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636164" data-ratio="0.53885400313972" data-width="2548" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636164"></a><figcaption>Some of the available armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Cuirass </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Cuirass</strong> - 11x Copper Ingots, 4x Plant Fibers</li><li><strong>Iron Cuirass</strong> - 16x Iron Ingots, 7x Light Leathers, 6x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Cuirass</strong> - 11x Thorium Ingots, 4x Medium Leathers, 20x Thorium Ingots, 7x Medium Leathers, 7x Linen Scraps, 4x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Cuirass</strong> - 25x Cobalt Ingots, 7x Heavy Leathers, 7x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Cuirass</strong> - 28x Adamantite Ingots, 8x Heavy Leathers, 7x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Cuirass</strong> - 24x Mithril Ingots, 8x Storm Leathers, 80x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p><strong>Greaves</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cooper Greaves</strong> - 9x Copper Ingot, 3x Plant Fiber</li><li><strong>Iron Greaves</strong> - 13x Iron Ingots, 6x Light Leathers, 4x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Greaves</strong> - 15x Thorium Ingots, 6x Medium Leathers, 6x Linen Scraps, 3x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Greaves</strong> - 18x Cobalt Ingots, 6x Heavy Leathers, 6x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Greaves</strong> - 22x Adamantite Ingots, 7x Heavy Leathers, 6x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Greaves</strong> - 12x Mithril Ingots, 18x Mithril Ingots, 6x Storm Leathers, 60x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p>Hopefully, as time goes on, we'll see this armor system expanded in Hytale. Right now, it's essentially the same as the weapons system, as every weapon category has six options, as well. Perhaps future updates will start to include some of the ultra-rare armor and weapons that we can currently see and equip in Creative, but this is what we have available in Survival at the start of early access in Hytale.</p>
