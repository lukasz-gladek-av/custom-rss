                <p>Earlier in September, Nintendo revealed that Pokemon is getting a cozy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>. Apparently the developers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> had similar ideas, because Pocketpair has now unveiled a spin-off cozy game of its own called Palworld: Palfarm.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmurGwwjvGM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AmurGwwjvGM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Much like Pokemon Pokopia, Palfarm lets players gather pals to help them live a quiet life as a farmer while handling the harvest, the cooking, and even the business of selling the food. The chosen pals also lend their special abilities to the player to make things easier on the farm.</p><p>However, it does appear that this game has a dark side. Pocketpair has confirmed that some pals will attack the communities you create in Palfarm. The trailer also has an unnerving sequence of a gunshop owner playing with a weapon that's much darker than the Pokemon games are willing to go.</p><p>Palworld: Palfarm is available to wish list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but it hasn't been confirmed for any of the consoles yet. The game's release date is currently unannounced. </p><p>In the interim, Nintendo has stepped up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">its legal battle against Pocketpair</a> over Palworld's similarities to Pokemon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">Pocketpair has removed some of the features</a> that Nintendo objected to, but now the latter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/" data-ref-id="1100-6534611">has cited a patent</a> that “covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” in a video game.</p><p>As part of the same case, Nintendo recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">mods don't count</a> as either games or "prior art." While there's no settlement in sight between the two sides, Pocketpair is moving forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-1-0-coming-in-2026-with-a-massive-amount-of-content-as-dev-teases-new-games/1100-6534766/" data-ref-id="1100-6534766">an ambitious slate of updates</a> for Palworld that will arrive in 2026.</p>

                <p>Over six years after its initial announcement, and nearly four years since Riot Games shared a first look at gameplay, 2XKO, the League of Legends fighting game, will soon be available to all. Riot has announced that the current 2XKO closed beta will end on October 7, and early access will begin the same day.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO's early-access period will include a "Season 0," which will function as the game's first seasonal event and include special in-game events and progression rewards. Season 0 will also mark the debut of a new champion to bring the playable roster to 10--though Riot has not confirmed who that champion will be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573219"></a><figcaption>2XKO</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Riot also revealed that 2026 will include five seasons, each of which will also add events, rewards, and a playable champion. All progress made in the closed beta will carry over to the early-access period, and all progress made in early access will also carry over to subsequent seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the early-access announcement, Riot Games also unveiled the First Impact competitive program, which will feature 22 community-led tournaments around the world through the end of 2025. Each tournament will receive a pot bonus from Riot for prizes, and if a duo wins a tournament, a special Duo Bounty will be rewarded on top of the first-place prize. The program's first event is the 2 NICE KO tournament at Evo France, which runs October 10-12.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO will be available in early access for PC beginning October 7.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Google's latest update to Google Play is a big one. The tech giant is bringing its multiplatform play out of beta and expanding its availability, allowing players to access Google Play games across both mobile and PC. It is also making a big push to further personalize the Google Play experience, which includes deeper integration with its AI products.</p><p>As detailed in <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Google is focusing on efforts designed to unify gaming experiences across platforms. The update marks the full launch of Google Play Games on PC, which had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-play-games-for-pc-beta-now-available-in-the-us-and-canada/1100-6508845/" data-ref-id="1100-6508845">been in beta for almost three years</a>. This system allows people to play a subset of Google Play games across both mobile and PC, and progress and rewards are shared between platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7hm7ha6EE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eb7hm7ha6EE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside this launch, Google is also deepening integration throughout its gaming ecosystem. Google Play Points, which players can earn through gameplay and participation in events to redeem for in-game items and Google Store purchases, are now shared across mobile and PC.</p><p>The company's big emphasis throughout the announcement post, though, is on its efforts to boost personalization and AI integration. The Google Play app is receiving new features to provide users recommendations, many of which are housed in a new "You Tab," which is meant to be a curated hub for a user's activity. Additionally, Game Detail Pages are getting overhauled to better surface user reviews, developer updates, and other information about specific games. Apparently, users will soon also be able to ask questions (presumably via AI integration) about a game directly from its Detail Page.</p><p>Google is also expanding how Google Play interfaces with in-game experiences, too. Users can now access Sidekick, an overlay that includes information about achievements, rewards, and other information about a game. Over time, this will receive Gemini integration, with the company intending Sidekick to evolve into an AI-powered assistant that can guide people without needing to leave a game.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC is now available to the general public, and many of the core updates to the app are rolling out right now. Google states that the AI-powered features will come in the next few months.</p>
