                <p>Pokemon and Aardman are teaming up for... something.

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now on PC and Xbox, but could MachineGames come back for a sequel or a different Indiana Jones game in the future? It's too soon to say, but Lucasfilm Games executive Douglas Reilly <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-video-game-plot-details-1236233902/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Variety</a> the team is "always looking for great stories." He stopped short of saying if MachineGames or another studio could make a new Indiana Jones game, however.</p><p>"Right now, we're focused on getting this one to the public and getting to the DLC and making this as successful as we can," Reilly said of the game and its upcoming The Order of Giants expansion. "I think we're always looking for great stories. And the good news is, there's a lot of space in between the films where we could tell more and more Indiana Jones stories that I think would be super interesting."</p><div tabindex="0"

Crusade, in the year 1937. Players take on the iconic role of Indiana Jones as they try to stop evil forces from obtaining a power known as The Great Circle.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_video_games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lots of Indiana Jones video games over the years</a>, and The Great Circle is the first title for console since Lego Indiana Jones 2 in 2011.</p><p>Also in the interview, Reilly shared more insight on how Lucasfilm interacts with game developers working on its properties. "We don't tell the teams how to run development. We don't tell them how to run their day-to-day of the business," he said.</p><p>For The Great Circle, Lucasfilm was involved in making sure the game "looks, feels, [and] sounds like Indiana Jones," and that included approving the casting of Troy Baker as Indiana Jones himself.</p><p>"Between the work MachineGames did in representing him physically and the absolutely stunning work Troy has done voicing the character, you forget it's not Harrison when you play it. He's that good," Reilly said.</p><p>Whether or not another Indiana Jones game from MachineGames or anyone else gets made likely has to do, in part, with the commercial success of The Great Circle. Microsoft doesn't typically announce sales numbers, and the fact that The Great Circle is also on Game Pass doesn't make it easy to understand how the game is performing. On Steam, The Great Circle is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as a top-seller </a>and has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2677660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached 12,000 concurrent players there</a>. It is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/top-paid/games/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not inside the top 500 games on Xbox's top paid games list</a>, but there are plenty of reasons for why this could be.</p><p>The Great Circle began development prior to Microsoft's acquisition of MachineGames via its buyout of parent company ZeniMax. Making The Great Circle exclusive to Xbox at launch is expected to amount to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost sales</a>, Microsoft has said. The Great Circle is scheduled to come to PS5 in Spring 2025.</p>

                <p>The festive season is here, and as is tradition, people have dusted off their ugliest sweaters to help celebrate this jolly time of the year. Over at Microsoft, employees are getting into the swing of things with an ugly sweater that celebrates one of the <em>ugliest</em> moments of Xbox history: the infamous red ring of death that plagued the Xbox 360 early in its console lifecycle.</p><p>In addition to a power button that can display both the green and the crimson symbols, the sweater also has an interesting arrangement of green and yellow stripes. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318401/microsoft-has-created-an-xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-ugly-sweater" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it's only currently available to Microsoft employees through the company's store, and stock has already sold out.</p><p>Anyone who owned an Xbox 360 early on likely experienced a red ring of death hardware failure, as this was a widespread issue that turned the console into a paperweight. This was a major problem for Microsoft at the time, and in the 2021 web series Power On, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the company explained how it happened</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2d6IMBS8oY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Leo Del Castillo, a member of Xbox's hardware engineering group, the red ring of death was caused by connectors inside the console's components that broke as a result of rapid heating and cooling. This problem--combined with thermal and stress issues in the Xbox 360 related to its soldering balls--eventually resulted in bricked consoles.</p><p>Microsoft's solution at the time was to repair and return the affected Xbox 360 at no cost to the consumer--an expensive fix that became a "1.15 billion dollar problem" according to former head of Xbox Peter Moore. Future hardware revisions of the Xbox 360 mostly managed to prevent this issue from occurring, and successor consoles like the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S haven't faced any major hardware failures on this scale.</p>
