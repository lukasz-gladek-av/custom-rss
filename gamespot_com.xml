                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/" data-ref-id="1100-6533750">certain parties</a> targeting payment processors as a way to control what kinds of games are allowed to be sold, paying for games on services like Steam is a little bit weird right now. In fact, if you've tried to pay for something on Steam using PayPal recently, you might've noticed that the option isn't available. This is apparently isolated to certain countries, and now Valve has offered an explanation.</p><p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote on its <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Purchasing Issues support page</a>, as reported by RockPaper Shotgun. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD."</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," the page continues. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p><p>Valve further confirmed to RPS that this is "regarding content on Steam related to what we've previously commented on surrounding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/" data-ref-id="1100-6533641">Mastercard</a>."</p><p>"One of PayPalâ€™s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," Valve explained via a spokesperson.</p><p>In other words, unless you're paying with euros, pounds, dollars (US, Australia, Canada), or Japanese Yen, you can't make Steam purchases using PayPal for the time being.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the arrival of new endgame content in a Monster Hunter Wilds update earlier this week, a pesky <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-knows-about-that-monster-hunter-wilds-crashing-bug-is-working-on-a-fix/1100-6533906/">crashing bug also snuck into the game</a>. But Capcom has stated that the issue has now been addressed with a hotfix. <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.01.00.html" rel="nofollow ">The patch notes</a> also point to a couple of other problems getting rectified with version 1.021.01.00.</p><p dir="ltr">The crashing bug could be triggered by fainting or utilizing fast-travel to get back to camp. Capcom quickly became aware of the problem after releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">the major update for the action-RPG</a> on August 12. That patch actually saw the company move up endgame content--such as tempered versions of monsters like Rey Dau in nine-star quests--from the still-planned Title Update 3 in September.</p>

Even other Call of Duty games aren't immune, as a short vignette has begun playing on screens in Warzone matches--and it features a face that should be familiar to Black Ops fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Call of Duty social media accounts have uploaded the clip, which will randomly begin playing on video screen around the Warzone map. The short video features Raul Menendez, a recurring villain in the Call of Duty world, speaking directly to the player when he appears, and when the clip ends, a Secret Challenge called "Watch Menendez's Threats" is earned.</p><p dir="ltr">"My name is Raul Menendez. As you can see, I am still alive and well," Menendez says in the teaser. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear." 2025 is a reference to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, in which the campaign was set in the year 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 was officially revealed as the final announcement of the Xbox Showcase in June.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has said he believes Microsoft is at a "fork in the road" and is questioning whether the company will keep releasing consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-two-make-it-cheaper-and-simpler-lets-do-that-instead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, Layden said there will certainly be more console generations to come, but Microsoft may not be part of that story. "Watching what Xbox has been doing recently, I do get Dreamcast flashbacks," he said, referencing how Sega got out of the console business after the Dreamcast and became a software company.</p><p>"I think Sega realized they just were better off being a software house. I think Microsoft is in that same sort of fork in the road. And I don't think their hardware offering is persuasive enough to make up the ground they've lost," he said.</p><p>If Microsoft were to get out of the console-making business, that would indeed be big news--and it would be unexpected given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft just recently signed a multi-year deal with AMD for future hardware</a>. Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room <em>and </em>in your hands," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-now-has-another-job-at-a-different-company/1100-6533857/" data-ref-id="1100-6533857">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-hardware/1100-6522486/">Bond has said in the past</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-gen Xbox hardware</a> will focus on "delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." It remains to be seen what that means, however, as some are theorizing that a new Xbox console could be more akin to a gaming PC. Microsoft is also branching out into the handheld space with its partnership with Asus for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/" data-ref-id="1100-6532506">upcoming Xbox ROG Ally devices.</a></p><p>Layden said he hopes to see some kind of standardization for consoles in the future, and it's his belief that going this way could help the total market for console gaming grow.</p><p>"Can't we look at the game console business kind of like Blu-ray, or cassette, or compact disc, or any other medium where the industry decided we'll compete on content, but let's standardize on format?" he said. "And then let's take that format and license it out to everybody who wants to support it. That's what stops the penetration rate of console gaming, I think."</p><p>For what it's worth, Sony is said to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">new PlayStation console</a>. And while Nintendo just recently released the Switch 2, the company is not likely to give up dedicated hardware anytime soon.</p><p>For now, there is no indication that Microsoft will stop making consoles, but the company has changed its playbook somewhat in recent times. The company is now bringing many of its games to rival platforms, like PS5 and Switch, in a bid to generate more revenue. And the plan is seemingly working, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">some of the best-selling PlayStation games are made by Xbox. </a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch will also fix an issue where achievements earned by a player wouldn't unlock on that player's profile. The patch notes do clarify, however, that some achievements fixed with the patch won't unlock automatically--for example, if the Pro and Expert achievements didn't unlock despite the player after reaching Level 10 and 30 respectively, the achievements will unlock the next time that player levels up.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes post also teases that cross-play will finally be coming to the game in the next major update, Patch 3. "Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce cross-play to the game," the post says. "Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but thatâ€™s still to be confirmed."</p><p dir="ltr">Players interested in checking out the changes in Rematch Patch 2 can do so by downloading and installing the Rematch beta app, which is available to all players who purchased the game on Steam. Beta progression is separate from main account progression, however, and only a few modes will be available in the beta test, including the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3v3 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">5v5 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">Customization (only the starting/default items will be available)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rematch is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.
