                <p>Europe's law enforcement agency is taking a closer look at online multiplayer games and gaming-adjacent platforms as the fears that criminals could be grooming, manipulating, and weaponizing children to commit violent crimes rise sharply in European society.</p><p>Europol (or the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) partnered with eight countries to identify and remove thousands of incidents of hateful rhetoric shared on gaming and gaming-related platforms. Conducted on November 13 and in partnership with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Europol's <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-and-partner-countries-combat-online-radicalisation-gaming-platforms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Referral Action Day program</a> reportedly uncovered around 5,408 links to jihadist content, 1,070 links to violent right-wing extremist and terrorist content, and 105 links to racist and xenophobic content on a variety of unnamed gaming platforms.</p><p>Europol's executive director, Catherine De Bolle, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/children-groomed-for-murder-through-video-games-europol-warns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to Politico</a> on November 21 about her fears following the findings by that joint committee dubbed the European Union Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). De Bolle said that, through these gaming platforms, criminal networks are recruiting children to engage in torture and murder.</p><p>"The weaponization of children for organized crime groups is what is going on at the moment on European soil," she said. "They weaponize the children to torture or to kill. It's not about petty theft anymore. It's about big crimes. [In one] worst-case, [we've seen a young boy who was ordered] to kill his younger sister, which happened. It’s cruel; we have never seen this before."</p><p>Europol discovered that criminals start grooming children by first joining their online multiplayer chats to talk about innocuous topics like family and pets. These public chats then move to more private servers where children are convinced to share sensitive data, such as family names and home addresses. With this knowledge, criminals could bribe or blackmail children into harming their families or themselves.</p><p>The Referral Action Day program uncovered all kinds of dangerous and violent content after combing through copious gaming and streaming platforms. According to the EU IRU's findings, criminals would re-enact terrorist attacks, executions, or school shootings in a game, edit videos with chants or suggestive emojis, and then share them on many commonly used social media platforms.</p><p>Europol claimed there have been at least 105 instances, including 10 contract killings, where violent crimes were "performed as a service" by children. Sometimes, the children were offered as much as $20,000 to commit the act, though Europol said not every child received their payment. If a child, viewed as a kind of remote-operated weapon, doesn't commit the act, then the criminals will shock them with horror as a reminder of what's owed.</p><p>"We also have children who do not execute the order and then, for instance, [the criminals] kill the pet of the child, so that the child knows very well, 'We know where you live, we know who you are, you will obey, and if you don't, we will go even further to kill your mother or your father,'" De Bolle explained. "Parents blame themselves in a lot of cases. They do not understand how it is possible. The problem is you don’t have access to everything your child does and you respect also the privacy of your children. But as a parent, you need to talk about the dangers of the internet."</p><p>Whether the child is bullied at school, has psychological problems, or is healthy and happy, De Bolle said no minor is safe. Criminals even go as far as extending the nature of the crime, from domestic violence to information spying for a hybrid war by state actors.</p><p>"You also have it with hybrid threat actors that are looking for the crime as a service model--the young perpetrators to listen to the foreign state, to listen to the communication around buildings," De Bolle said.</p><p>Though not specifically cited by Europol and the EU IRU, the game creation platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> has raised alarms for parents and politicians over the years regarding children's safety concerns. The platform, which has a player base that's mostly under the age of 13, has been at the center of a handful of recent lawsuits over child exploitation and grooming. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> are suing developer Roblox Corporation for failing to protect kids. Roblox Corporation has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">announced a new face-scanning initiative</a> to verify the ages of its users and prevent minors from talking to adults, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">a California lawmaker</a> believes the developer should continue to "do more" to ensure the safety of the minors who play the game.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s new California Resistance update is out now, adding a range of new things for players to experience, including a brand-new map, Eastwood. The map is hiding a Breaking Bad Easter Egg, players have discovered, and it's one of the best-known Breaking Bad references from the show.</p><p>One of the buildings on the new Eastwood map has a pizza on the roof of its garage--this is pretty clearly a reference to the show's 2010 Season 3, Episode 2 episode, "Caballo sin Nombre." In this episode, Walter (Bryan Cranston) tosses an entire pizza onto the roof in a fit of rage. Now, you can see that pizza in Battlefield 6, or something like it.</p><p>This scene became an internet meme, and other games, like High on Life, have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/10bxubi/the_house_in_high_on_life_has_an_unsliced_pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">referenced it as well.</a></p><p>There is some fantastic lore surrounding the pizza-throwing scene in Breaking Bad. Writer Peter Gould <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4VO7HxpkaE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled</a> how difficult he imagined the scene was to film, as Cranston was asked to throw the pizza box, have the pizza separate, and then have the pizza land in the right spot for the shot.</p><p>As it turned out, Cranston nailed it on the first take, something that Gould said was extremely unlikely. Series creator Vince Gilligan commented on it as well. "It was just one of those perfect moments where it looked like it was too perfect to be real, but in fact it was," he said.</p><p>Given the popularity of the scene, and because it was filmed on location at a local Albuquerque resident's home, fans of the show flocked to the location and tried the feat out for themselves. This upset the locals, and Gilligan himself had to <a href="https://time.com/3740595/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issue a statement to fans asking them to please not do that.</a> The house went up for sale earlier this year, asking just under $4 million, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/breaking-bad-house-sale-walter-white/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a huge premium of 10X its estimated value.</a> The house has not sold yet, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3828-Piermont-Dr-NE-Albuquerque-NM-87111/6776276_zpid/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Zillow records.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg6dxhJbq78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="123">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bg6dxhJbq78?start=123" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For Gilligan's new Albuquerque-set show, Pluribus, his team <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/pluribus-vince-gilligan-rhea-seehorn-1236414569/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">built an entire cul-de-sac of houses</a> to help avoid another similar tourist attraction situation for people hoping to visit where the main character lives.</p><p>As for Battlefield 6, the new California Resistance update for Season 1 adds the Eastwood map and the Sabotage mode. There are also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-california-resistance-event-pass-all-free-and-paid-rewards-to-unlock/2900-7264/" data-ref-id="2900-7264">new rewards to unlock in the event pass, including free and paid DLC. </a></p><p>New US sales data from Circana showed that Battlefield 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game for October and for 2025 so far</a>.

"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don't over-expect or hype it," the producer said. "We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem (RE9) - Official 2nd Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Leon starred alongside Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2, which was set in Raccoon City. So he definitely fits the criteria teased by Kumazawa. On the flip side, Capcom explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/">why Leon was a "bad match" for Resident Evil Requiem</a> earlier this year. The caveat and wiggle room here for Capcom is that Leon was discussed as the protagonist in this light, meaning that he could still show up as an NPC. That said, Kumuzawa is clearly trying to temper expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Kumuzawa opened up about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-abandoned-multiplayer-vision-because-it-wasnt-scary-enough/1100-6536283/">Resident Evil Requiem originally being developed as an online open-world multiplayer game</a>. While this version "was fun to play," Kumuzawa admitted it "wasn't scary enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-may-be-the-most-extreme-in-the-series-says-director/1100-6534329/">Resident Evil will be "an incredible rollercoaster" for players</a>. The survival-horror game is set to launch February 27 on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-scares-its-way-onto-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6534701/">and Switch 2</a>.</p>
