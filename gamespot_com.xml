                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> has an official release date of February 11, 2026, executive director and game producer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has revealed. Priced at $50, it'll land early next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 port also being considered.</p><p>Suda added that the release date could be delayed by up to two weeks if the master copy of the game is rejected up to three times, which would result in Romeo Is A Dead Man launching around the same time as "that title with a big nine" on its box art. Suda is likely referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-preorder-guide-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-pc/1100-6535813/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which launches on February 27 next year. Suda said that it was looking to avoid facing off against some stiff competition.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceog9nU0ucs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ceog9nU0ucs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developer Grasshopper Manufacture will also self-publish the game, a first for the studio. As for the proposed Switch 2 port, Suda51 said this could happen after the game's launch.</p><p>"We've got to make sure it works on PC and the other platforms that have already been decided on," Suda said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "And since we're using Unreal Engine 5 for Romeo is a Dead Man, we need to make sure that we can find a way that the engine is going to play nicely with Switch 2, using stuff like Nanite and Lumen and other things--some of them are new to us, some of them them might have issues with Switch 2, with porting and stuff."</p><p>Billed as a third-person adventure, Romeo is a Dead Man puts players in the boots of FBI Space-Time special agent Romeo Stargazer as he hunts down fugitives across the multiverse and searches for his lost girlfriend, Juliet.</p><p>The game's current release date puts it in the middle of a very busy February, as it launches a day before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-kiwami-1-2-0-directors-cut-preorder-guide/1100-6534988/">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and other highlights that month include Tales of Berseria Remastered, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-fixes-the-originals-painful-slog/1100-6536315/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6534725/">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and No Sleep for Kaname Date on PS5.</p>
