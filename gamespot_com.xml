                <p>CES 2025 is officially underway, and one of the big gaming announcements so far was a partnership between Nvidia and Krafton for AI-powered teammates who can help you in battle in PUBG.</p><p>Nvidia and Krafton created what they are calling CPCs, or co-playable characters. These characters use artificial intelligence to fight alongside you. This feature is called called PUBG Ally, and the CPC is apparently smart enough to play like a human would. You can say something like, "Hey Ally, I'm looking for a level 3 vest and 5.56 ammo." The CPC will then search the map and try to find it for you. The PUBG Ally can also spot enemies and cover you, locate nearby vehicles, and speak back to you with an AI-powered voice. You can see some of the test footage in action below.</p><p>Note that what you're seeing in the video is representative of R&amp;D gameplay. The PUBG Ally feature <a href="https://x.com/PUBG/status/1876554285745606665" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hasn't actually been greenlit yet</a> and may never come to PUBG.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Transform solo gameplay into a seamless team experience with PUBG Ally. ðŸŽ®<br>KRAFTON and NVIDIA have teamed up to create the worldâ€™s first Co-Playable Character (CPC), built with NVIDIA ACE.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/jAaibitkgq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jAaibitkgq</a></p>  â€” NVIDIAGameDev (@NVIDIAGameDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Krafton's Sims-like inZOI will also make use of this new CPC feature, though no footage or any other details were revealed as of yet. Naraka: Bladepoint's mobile version will use CPCs as well.</p><p>It appears what was announced here is more of an outline for what could be possible down the road--not something that's ready right now. Krafton CEO CH Kim said this new AI technology will "revolutionize the gaming industry," while Nvidia boss Keita Iida said, "AI is transforming the way games are created and played."</p><p>Plenty of people remain skeptical about how AI could actually shake up video games, in part because AI is nothing new at all in the world of gaming. There are also concerns by many about how further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">could impact people who make games.</a> Video game actors have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">on strike since July 2024</a> due in part to concerns about AI.</p>
