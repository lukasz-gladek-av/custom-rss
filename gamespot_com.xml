                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> exploded into existence in late 2024 and hasn't relented in pace since. While codes for freebies in NetEase's hero shooter are scarce, the developer has been known to dish out rewards including free skins in the past.</p><p>We've got a full list of the current active Marvel Rivals codes, as well as any that were once active and have now expired. We'll be regularly updating this guide as soon as new Rivals codes drop, so make sure to bookmark it.</p><h2>New Marvel Rivals codes</h2><p>There are currently no active Marvel Rivals codes; check back later!</p><h3>Expired codes</h3><ul><li>nwarh4k3xqy - Iron Man Model 42 Skin</li></ul><p>To celebrate the launch of the game, NetEase released the above code for a free Iron Man Model 42 skin, which expired in early March 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461640-marvel-rivals-codes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461640-marvel-rivals-codes%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461640"></a><figcaption>Marvel Rivals code redeem page</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461640-marvel-rivals-codes%281%29.jpg"></figure><h2>How to redeem Marvel Rivals codes</h2><p><strong>Follow these instructions to redeem your Rivals codes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open the Settings menu</strong></li><li><strong>Click 'Bundle Code'</strong></li><li><strong>Copy and paste your code from the list above</strong></li><li><strong>Click 'Redeem'</strong></li><li><strong>Enjoy your rewards!</strong></li></ul><h2>Free Marvel Rivals skins</h2><p>Alongside codes, there are other ways to snag free Rivals skins. In the past, there have been giveaways, Twitch drops, and platform-exclusive freebies. During Season 0, PlayStation users could get their hands on the Peni Parker VEN#m skin, an MVP animation, spray, and nameplate in the PS-exclusive bundle with came with 300 Chrono Tokens to spend in the in-game store on items of your choice.</p><p>Marvel Rivals Twitch drops run for a limited time and reward you for simply watching your favorite creator stream the game on Twitch. Currently, the active Marvel Rivals Twitch drops are running from March 13 to April 3, and include the following rewards:</p><ul><li><strong>Adam Warlock Spray - Watch for 30 minutes</strong></li><li><strong>Adam Warlock Nameplate - Watch for one hour</strong></li><li><strong>Adam Warlock Skin - Watch for four hours</strong></li></ul><p>To claim these Twitch drops, first ensure that your Twitch account is linked to your Marvel Rivals account by visiting the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/twitchdrops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>. Then, once you've met the criteria above, login to your <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch inventory</a> and claim your freebies. The next time you log in to Marvel Rivals, your rewards will be in your inbox. Any streamer who has enabled drops playing Marvel Rivals in the correct category will count towards your progress, and you do not need to watch the same streamer for the entire duration in order to qualify for the free items. If you're unsure how long you've been watching for, you can also check your Twitch inventory for your progression percentage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461638-marvel-rivals-codes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461638" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461638-marvel-rivals-codes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461638"></a><figcaption>Peni Parker's Blue Tarantula skin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4461638-marvel-rivals-codes.jpg"></figure><p>Another way to get free skins is by just playing the game. If you've reached far enough on the free version of the battle pass you'll be collecting the in-game currency, Chrono Tokens. 400 Chrono Tokens can currently get you the Peni Parker Blue Tarantula or Scarlet Witch Emporium Matron skins from the battle pass pages, and these change each season. If you're playing the game's ranked mode, reaching gold by the end of the season will also get you the Invisible Woman Blood Shield and Human Torch Blood Blaze skins. There are more skins to be redeemed if you've purchased the Luxury Battle Pass, too.</p><p>Finally, Marvel Rivals events come and go, and sometimes these provide free skins too. The current Midnight Features event has the Groot Carved Traveler skin if you complete all of the investigations during the time the event is active. The Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, similarly, makes the Black Widow Mrs. Barnes skin available for progression.</p>
