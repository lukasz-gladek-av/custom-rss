                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed Death Stranding 2: On The Beach's title screen with a tantalizing teaser, but no one should get too attached to it just yet. Kojima clarified that the title screen is "still very much temporary."</p><p>Right now, the screen features the game's name and a background image of Norman Reedus' character, Sam Porter, and a baby. The title screen has options for "Continue," "New Game," "Load Game," "Options," and "Recap of Death Stranding." That last one might be handy for anyone who needs a refresher on the events of the 2019 game, which had a narrative full of twists, turns, and <a href="https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Conan O'Brien. </a></p><p>In another update, Kojima shared an image of his work desk featuring a very comfy-looking chair. A second image appears to show multiple Death Stranding 2 save files.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 follows Sam and his companions as they embark on "a new journey to save humanity from extinction." Players will travel through a world full of "otherworldly enemies" and obstacles, while players will also face existential questions throughout the story, according to the game's description.</p><p>As mentioned, Reedus returns in the lead role, while Lea Seydoux comes back to play Fragile. Troy Baker, meanwhile, returns as Higgs. Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna join the sequel in new roles.</p><p>As for when we might see or learn more about Death Stranding 2, that remains to be seen. Kojima revealed Death Stranding 2 at his good friend Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards in December 2022. Some are expecting more information about the sequel to come at the 2024 edition of the show this December.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is set for release on PS5 at some point in 2025. Kojima is also developing an Xbox-exclusive game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, along with an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint.</a></p>
