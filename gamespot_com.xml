                <p>This summer, two of the classic Tony Hawk skateboarding games will get a modern makeover in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-release-date-trailer-songs-game-pass/1100-6529971/" data-ref-id="1100-6529971">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. But the party is getting started a little early in Los Angeles. AEG Presents and Activision have announced that THPS Fest is coming to LA's famous El Rey Theatre on May 8. Tony Hawk himself will be on hand for the event alongside his fellow pro skaters as they reveal new details about Pro Skater 3 + 4. And fans will be able to watch it live on Twitch.</p><p>The news came with a brief announcement trailer that features the exterior of the real El Rey before transitioning to some of the levels from Pro Skater 3 + 4. Activision also noted that the El Rey theater will be "meticulously recreated" in the Los Angeles level.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiAH--83EJg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PiAH--83EJg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Activision recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-revealed-includes-mix-of-new-and-old/1100-6530119/" data-ref-id="1100-6530119">the soundtrack from the game</a>, and a handful of the artists--Danny Brown, Lupe Fiasco, Adolescents, and Urethane--will perform live during THPS Fest. Hawk recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-is-to-blame-or-credit-for-34s-controversial-soundtrack-changes/1100-6530488/" data-ref-id="1100-6530488">he personally selected the songs for the upcoming remaster</a>, and that he hopes the discovery of new songs "is half the fun" for players.</p><p>THPS Fest will begin on May 8 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET and run until 10 PM PT / 1 AM ET. However, the official release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 won't be until July 11. It's coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It has also been announced that Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be on Game Pass on day one.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed the batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers in May. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting May 6--<strong>Ark: Survival Evolved</strong>, <strong>Balatro</strong>, and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-april-2025/1100-6530328/" data-ref-id="1100-6530328">April's PlayStation Plus free games yet</a>, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p>Released last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a> was a big hit thanks to its captivating combination of poker and roguelike deckbuilding gameplay. The game is deceptively simple at first, but as you dig deeper into it, you'll find several twists and turns that require you to create various synergies and builds with the cards you have on hand. All of this adds up to an immensely satisfying experience as you run through various strategies, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/">10 best games of 2024</a>.</p><p>One of the big names in the survival genre, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ark-survival-evolved-review/1900-6416754/" data-ref-id="1900-6416754">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> gives you all the tools you need to thrive in a world of prehistoric creatures and alien mysteries. This version of the game has been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, and it features numerous quality-of-life upgrades as well. You'll also have access to all of Ark’s worlds here, and there's public online multiplayer for up to 70 players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485249"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Plus games for May 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/" data-ref-id="1900-6418066">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> is a boomer-shooter that looks like it was ripped straight from a PC running a Windows 95 operating system on it. It goes all in on its Warhammer 40K setting, offering fast-paced action and a satisfying arsenal of weapons to wield against the enemies of humanity, like Chaos Space Marines and the daemons who follow them into battle.</p><p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-are-the-games-leaving-ps-plus-premium-and-extra-in-may-2025/2900-6499/" data-ref-id="2900-6499">several games will also be leaving PS Plus Premium and Extra in May</a>, so you have a short amount of time to check out GTA V, Ghostrunner, Batman: Arkham Knight, and several other titles.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus free games for May 2025</h2><p><em>Available May 6 until June 2.</em></p><ul><li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (PS5, PS4)</li><li>Ark: Survival Evolved (PS5)</li><li>Balatro (PS5, PS4)</li></ul>

                <p>Once again, Sega has delayed the launch of the next Sonic the Hedgehog game. Sonic Rumble, a free-to-play mobile title, is no longer having its global debut on May 8. It's now delayed indefinitely.</p><p>"We know this news may be disappointing, and it wasn't a decision we made lightly. We at Sega share that disappointment, especially because we're making this call so close to the launch timing we had originally hoped for. However, we believe taking this extra time is the right choice for the future of Sonic Rumble," the publisher said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000145/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Sega also warned that while some mobile store pages might show a specific launch date for Sonic Rumble, this is only a placeholder date.</p><p>Sonic Rumble has been available for months now as part of a pre-launch testing period, and Sega said it's thankful to fans for their feedback so far.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZaVZB-QMco" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZaVZB-QMco" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Anyone currently playing Sonic Rumble in its pre-release launch can look forward to the next update, 1.2, which adds a new "Rumble Ranking" feature and the ability to group together with friends in "Crews." Finally, the 1.2 update adds unique abilities in the form of Skills.</p><p>More details about the new features in the 1.2 update will be announced in the coming days, Sega said.</p><p>"These upcoming changes will fundamentally reshape the game, and one thing has become clear: We want to create a game that evolves and stays fun for months and years to come. To build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting Sonic game our players deserve, we need more time," Sega said.</p><p>Sonic Rumble was originally set to have its global public launch in 2024, but that didn't happen, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-rumble-now-coming-spring-2025-following-delay/1100-6529724/" data-ref-id="1100-6529724">Sega delayed the game to Spring 2025.</a></p><p>Whenever it's ready, Sonic Rumble will release on iOS and Android, as well as for PC via Steam. As for the console series, the latest release was 2024's Sonic X Shadows Generations. The next big release is Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, which launches later this year for console and PC.</p><p>Outside of games, the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-gets-march-2027-release-date/1100-6528922/" data-ref-id="1100-6528922">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set for releases in theaters in March 2027</a>. The movie series has been a big hit, banking more than $1 billion across its first three entries so far.</p>
