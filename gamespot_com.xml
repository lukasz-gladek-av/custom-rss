                <p>Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1999102778430374329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent 39.10 update</a> that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death.</p><p>Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, <a href="https://x.com/Dashybear/status/1999117362537037986" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it actually appears rather little</a>. The perspective could be off, but <a href="https://x.com/NexusFNx/status/1999114419301650916" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">based on screenshots circulating on X</a>, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as "Littlefoot," then.</p><p>This isn't the first time Bigfoot made an appearance in Fortnite. The mythical creature was a purchasable outfit in 2019, but this is its first addition as a random NPC.</p><p>While Bigfoot ducks and dodges Fortnite's gunfights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian is gearing up to serve looks</a> and bullets. The social media star will join the battle royale shooter on December 13, with all the glitz and glam you'd expect.</p>

                <p>A new report detailed how much it costs for developers to have their games shown off at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reported</a> that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer.</p><p>The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources.</p><p>The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lix-averages-record-audience-of-127-7-million-viewers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million)</a>, but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43610365/some-commercials-super-bowl-lix-sold-8m-per-reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted the organizers of The Game Awards for comment on ad pricing.</p><p>People have criticized The Game Awards for appearing to be more of a marketing event for upcoming games as opposed to a celebration of developers and their achievements. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>Host and organizer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-creator-hears-your-feedback-do-we-always-get-it-right-no/1100-6536808/" data-ref-id="1100-6536808">recently responded to these concerns</a>, saying "it is a balancing act."</p><p>"There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that the promise of new and exciting game reveals helps raise the profile of The Game Awards and inspires more people to tune in. At the same time, if more people watch, The Game Awards can in theory charge more for ad placement.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Kotaku report also mentioned that The Game Awards gives developers who are nominated for awards at least two tickets to attend the ceremony. Tickets to The Game Awards are available to the general public, and Expedition 33 developer Sandfall was reported to have "bought a swath of tickets" at around $300 each to help more staffers attend the show. Expedition 33 picked up 12 total nominations, the most ever for a game, including Game of the Year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been one of 2025's breakout success stories in gaming, and it was developed on a relatively small budget, apparently.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reports</a> that the budget was "less than $10 million," crediting the information to developer Sandfall. The report added that the team "conserved resources" by purposefully avoiding an open-world setup in favor of making Expedition 33 a turn-based game.</p><p>Sandfall's Guillaume Broche said Sandfall now has the right technology to "make those games with a relatively small team," and he hopes to see more like it from other studios.</p><p>"Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early," he said.</p><p>Broche did not elaborate as to what technology specifically he was referring to as it relates to being able to embrace new systems to build games on a smaller budget. GameSpot has contacted Sandfall for further details on Expedition 33's budget.</p><p>Independent developer Billy Basso, who made Animal Well, said he hopes to see "more straightforward games" in the future. "You don't need to fill your game with hundreds of hours of checklist content," Basso said.</p><p>Expedition 33 was also notable for its relatively lower price point, as the game sells for $50 instead of the $70 or more that many other games ask. Some industry-watchers have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA games are becoming unsustainable</a> due in part to their larger budgets, and in turn, the requirement that they sell lots of copies to make their money back.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a "core team" of about 30 people, the report said, with battle animations outsourced to a studio in Korea. Sandfall also worked with other external teams on things like marketing and localization. The game's credits list <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/241065/clair-obscur-expedition-33/credits/windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of people</a> who worked on the game, and this has led some to question if the game should have received a nomination for "Best Independent Game" game at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Previous estimates</a> suggested the game's budget was as much as $25 million.</p><p>The game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">sold more than 5 million copies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-breaks-game-pass-records/1100-6536666/" data-ref-id="1100-6536666">broke Xbox Game Pass records.</a> It's nominated for 12 awards at The Game Awards, including overall Game of the Year, and that's the most nominations for any game in the show's history.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>
