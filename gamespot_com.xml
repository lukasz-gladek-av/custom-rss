                <p>Earlier this summer, Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">Hideo Kojima laughed when asked if he would play the remake</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, before flatly replying, "No, I won't."

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after spending decades as one of the top creative minds in the company. Since that time, Kojima has launched his own company and released two Death Stranding games. Okamura has openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and expressed his desire to work with him again on MGS. However, Kojima has his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">MGS-like game</a> called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, which may still be a few years away. The director recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/" data-ref-id="1100-6533807">Physint is still in a conceptual phase</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out today on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Although it won't be ready at launch, Konami is adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/" data-ref-id="1100-6532384">a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a> this fall. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-deltas-new-online-multiplayer-mode-wont-support-cross-play/1100-6533922/">it won't support cross-play</a>. The new version of the game was very positively received in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">GameSpot's review of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>

                <p>While players are still enjoying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Peak's brand-new Mesa biome</a>, the game's latest patch is here to address some technical concerns--specifically making it easier to run <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> on lower-powered computers.</p><p>The latest patch, which brings the game to version 1.27.a, introduces a new Texture Quality graphics setting. The new option, which Team Peak says has been much-requested, allows players with low VRAM to lower the texture quality, reducing the incidence of low framerates, missing graphics, and potential crashes. The developer notes that the lower texture quality "doesn’t even look much worse," so it's worth checking out for anyone who's been experiencing performance issues in Peak.</p><p>The developer has also added support for DX11 graphics API, alongside existing options DX12 and Vulkan. "It might be better, it might be worse," the patch notes warn, but suggest players who have had issues with the other options give it a try anyway. "We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!"</p><p>The performance-focused update has also made Peak's existing Render Scale options "more dramatic," meaning players who choose Medium or Low options should see a more obvious difference in performance.</p><p>In addition to these changes, Team Peak has added a new accessibility setting in the form of Photosensitive Mode, which dials down a number of visual effects that may impact people with photosensitivity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new performance options make up the bulk of this update, though a few other things have been mopped up with the small patch. In absence of a true map randomizer, the dev says Mesa and Peak will now simply alternate every other day--and because Mesa will appear less often, the secret entrance in the map will now appear 50% of the time instead of 25%.</p><p>The Peak dev has also reintroduced a known issue to the game with The Kiln's lava--the patch notes say they failed to reproduce the issue in-house, so are re-enabling the rising lava in hopes of getting more reports about the bug and when it occurs.</p><p>Check out the full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498330460301034111" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>PEAK PATCH 1.27.a:</h2><h3>OPTIONS</h3><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS SETTING: Texture Quality  <ul><li>This is actually huge. You can now lower the texture quality across the game, which is important for players with low VRAM. This can resolve issues with low framerate, missing graphics, and even crashes. Also it doesn’t even look much worse. Check it out!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS API: DX11  <ul><li>The game can now be launched in DX11 in addition to our DX12 and Vulkan options. For players who have had trouble with our previous two options, give this a try. It might be better, it might be worse. We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!</li></ul></li><li>Render Scale options are now more dramatic, you should see higher performance gains if you play on Medium or Low.</li><li>NEW ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: Photosensitive Mode.  <ul><li>This mode changes the following:  <ul><li>Dynamite, Flare, and Scout Cannon lit fuse effects are less flashy</li><li>Screenshake is lessened.</li><li>Bright lights from the dynamite explosion are disabled.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from taking various sources of damage are less intense and more gradual.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from the Energy Drink, Lollipop, and Heat Pack are less intense.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>You can now change your sash in the Passport to any you’ve unlocked via ascents!</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><ul><li>The ALPINE and the MESA will now alternate every other day.</li><li>A secret entrance in the MESA is now open 50% of the time instead of 25%. Feels fair considering the MESA itself is now open 50% of the time as well.</li><li>The Lava Rises again in THE KILN. Admittedly, we didn't fix the issue with it--but since we weren't able to reproduce the issue on our end, we figured it would be helpful to put it back up and get more reports in. If the lava becomes desynced for you, please send us a video or logs!</li></ul><h3>BALANCE</h3><ul><li>Wait time until the lava rises increased by 1 minute.</li><li>The time for the lava to reach the top once it starts is increased by 3 minutes.</li></ul><h3>MINOR FIXES</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where you could pocket unpocketable items while climbing.</li><li>Replaced bees sounds in Bug Phobia Mode.</li><li>Fog walls raised in height again because apparently you could still do Cannon exploit if you did it just right.</li></ul>

The update introduces competition in the form of Hyland Point's Benzies family, as well as a new property to purchase, a new vehicle, and more.</p><p>Viral hit Schedule 1 sees players build a drug-dealing empire from the ground up, and the new update adds some new obstacles for the player's rise to power--as well as new possibilities. The Benzies family will only be introduced once the player has unlocked a few customers in Westville, and once you're on their radar, they'll interfere with your business through ambushes, theft, robbing your dealers, and stealing your customers. You'll also be able to truce with the Benzies, unlocking new cartel-player deals.</p><p>Once you've completed the rival cartel's full storyline, you'll be able to purchase the new Hyland Manor property. The update also comes with a few new features, including a graffiti system that can be used to reduce the cartel's influence and gain XP. Cartel influence is something you'll have to be aware of as you progress through Schedule 1--different areas on the map will now be locked if cartel influence is too high, and players will have to reduce the influence in order to unlock new regions.</p><p>As well as the new property and mechanics, the update also adds a handful of new items and cosmetics, including the Hotbox vehicle, a pump shotgun, and some new hairstyles for you to customize the player character.</p><p>Despite its runaway success, Schedule 1 is the work of a single developer operating as Tyler's Video Game Studio, or TVGS. Tyler has apologized for recent updates taking longer than initially scheduled, and in the most recent Steam update said that he will no longer be specifying release dates for updates. The solo dev has also said that he hopes to get some office space and bring a couple of full-time developers on board for Schedule 1 soon.</p><p>Check out the rest of the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1's latest update</a> below:</p><h2>Schedule 1 v0.4.0</h2><h3>Additions</h3><ul><li>Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point.

                <p>Next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will introduce players to Grace Ashcroft, the newest protagonist in the franchise. In the trailers shared so far, Grace has been way over her head in danger. That's how she enters the story, but she won't remain that way forever. According to director Kōshi Nakanishi, Grace's transformation from helpless to powerful may represent the "most extreme gap" in the franchise.</p><p>"We're at the testing phase now in development as we gear up to the February release, and even as we play it internally, putting ourselves in the mindset of the players--I really feel that it's going to be an incredible rollercoaster," Nakanishi told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "They're going to feel like that curve of tension to release is going to be ... it's perhaps the most extreme gap between those two axes. The points on that curve are going to be so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil 9 Requiem - Official Gamescom Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To illustrate his point without giving away spoilers, Nakanishi referred to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">the unhinged creature that hunts Grace in the trailer</a>. It's the latest stalker character in the RE franchise, but Grace will have a way to deal with it even if she can't kill it.</p><p>"We're pretty tight-lipped on the details at this stage, but we want to give players a method to overcome the stalker enemy," noted Nakanishi. "What that entails is something that we'll be getting into down the line, but I think that you'll feel like you finally have a chance to turn the tables and deal with the stalker in a way that you haven't been able to in past titles."</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. It's part of Capcom's plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-gears-up-for-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-celebration-with-new-website/1100-6534067/" data-ref-id="1100-6534067">the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil</a>, most of which remain under wraps for now. Weapons director Zach Cregger is also helming the new Resident Evil movie, which is set to debut in theaters on September 18, 2026.</p>
