                <p>Mass Effect fans know that November 7 has been designated by BioWare as N7 Day to celebrate the franchise. And while a new Mass Effect game is still likely years away, this year's N7 Day includes some Mass Effect content that you can find in BioWare's latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p><p>There are three items that can be found, all of which reference Commander Shepard from the original Mass Effect trilogy:</p><ul><li>Command Helmet</li><li>Paragon of Leadership</li><li>Specter of Battles Past</li></ul><p>These N7 pieces are just cosmetic, so don't expect the armor to have any stats. The good news is that it's extremely easy to find this free content drop. After players finish The Singing Blade mission within the main quest, the Mass Effect armor will be waiting in a new chest located beside the Caretaker in the Lighthouse. If you've already beaten The Singing Blade and the chest isn't there, exit the game and make sure it's been updated. The chest should be there when you resume play.</p><p>Unfortunately for Dragon Age fans, BioWare recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">The Veilguard won't get any story expansion DLC</a> because the team is now focused on the next Mass Effect game. But if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-streamer-spent-almost-a-whole-day-making-sure-her-rook-was-a-smokeshow/1100-6527593/" data-ref-id="1100-6527593">the numerous create-a-character options in The Veilguard</a> are any indication, Mass Effect's next title will give players even greater control over their character's appearance than before.</p>

                <p>The centerpiece of Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 marketing campaign--Peter Stormare's The Replacer--is coming to the game as a playable character in the upcoming Season 1 update.</p><p>The Replacer tracer pack operator bundle comes with two skins for The Replacer, including a standard version and a bonus version for people who own the new Season 1 BlackCell bundle. The package also includes weapon blueprints for guns called Quick Wit and Ramifications, along with the "Aura +5000" animated calling card, the "Many Hats" animated emblem, the "Replacement Killer" finishing move, and a vehicular weapon charm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396348-screenshot2024-11-07at2.21.57pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396348" data-ratio="0.55862068965517" data-width="725" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396348-screenshot2024-11-07at2.21.57pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396348"></a><figcaption>The Replacer comes to Black Ops 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396348-screenshot2024-11-07at2.21.57pm.png"></figure><p>For the BlackCell version of The Replacer, Activision warned that players need to buy the BlackCell bundle first; the skin won't work if you buy the BlackCell bundle after buying the Replacer bundle.

                <p>8BitDo has released some great keyboards, but so far, they've all been tenkeyless (TKL) models that don't include a traditional numpad (although these are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Supports-Calculator-Bluetooth-Gaming-Console/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold separately as add-ons</a>).

With these keyboards, you're getting a 108-key layout, V2 Kailh Box white switches, dye-sub PBT keycaps, hot-swappable PCB for easy key switch replacement, and support for N-key rollover. Like other 8BitDo products, these keyboards can also be heavily customized using the company's in-house Ultimate Software program, or if you're in a hurry, fast-mapping on programmable buttons won't require booting up the 8BitDo client.</p>                      </div><p>These also support wireless connections via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth as well as wired via USB-C, and the included Super Buttons are a pair of big microswitch keys that can be customized to serve a wide selection of functions. The form factor on these keyboards are also very ergonomic, as the contoured design makes them feel great to work on. If they're anything like the smaller models, these will work great on not only Windows and Android devices, but also wirelessly on iOS, Mac, and Steam Deck.</p><hr><h2>More 8BitDo Keyboard Deals</h2><p>Alternatively, you can grab the current TKL models as well, as these are available in a wider selection of retro-inspired designs.

You can also pick up the 8BitDo N30 wireless mouse at a discounted price, as this is on sale for $19.80 (normally $30). While it has a barebones design, it includes a customizable D-Pad on the side--something you won't find on other wireless mice.

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced what's next for Grand Theft Auto Online, and November's updates to the multiplayer game is all about what some believe be the game's best and most exciting feature: <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Heists_in_GTA_Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heists</a>.</p><p>Every week in November will focus on a different GTA Online Heist. This kicks off this week with the Cayo Perico Heist, with more to come throughout the month.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, GTA Online's heists call on players to take part in multi-mission campaigns with the aim of committing a high-profile crime with a lucrative payout.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_The_Cayo_Perico_Heist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cayo Perico heist</a>, which was first released in 2020, has players trekking to the private island of Cayo Perico, fighting against armed guards, and getting away with all the money you can find. Players can take on heists solo or with friends, and coordinating with teammates makes it pretty thrilling.</p><p>November also brings a new Community Challenge, and this one is all about heists, naturally. Rockstar is calling on players to collectively steal $20 trillion worth of in-game cash between now and December 4, and if successful, Rockstar will give out "a vault full of rewards" to players.</p><p>Players who successfully complete the Cayo Perico heist between now and November 13 will earn the Panther Statue, with other rewards to be revealed later for completing more heists in November.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180" data-ratio="0.561850802644" data-width="1059" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180"></a><figcaption>The Panther Statue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png"></figure><p>For more, be sure to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kk3243ka35572/break-into-the-heist-challenge-all-month-long" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Rockstar's full blog post</a> to get up to speed on everything new in GTA Online this week and beyond.

The game has been steadily supported over the years and has a passionate fanbase. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-s-online-mode-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-take-two-says-about-its-monetary-opportunity/1100-6418882/" data-ref-id="1100-6418882">"the gift that keeps on giving"</a> for Take-Two, because it brings in so much money.</p><p>Many are wondering what's going to happen to GTA Online when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">GTA 6 launches in 2025</a>, and that remains to be seen.</p>
