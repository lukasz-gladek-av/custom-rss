                <p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact," said Roh via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be "inevitable."</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><p>The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.</p><p>A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-reportedly-combatting-gpu-shortages-by-bringing-back-discontinued-graphics-card/1100-6537185/" data-ref-id="1100-6537185">by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs</a>. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.</p><p>As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/" data-ref-id="1100-6537146">it happened again</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-has-only-gone-and-done-it-again-smashing-another-world-record/1100-6537158/" data-ref-id="1100-6537158">And again</a>. This time around, her "sister" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator<a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vedal987</a> become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time.</p><p>After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to "Give it a rest." He added, "In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay." Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, "No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/jasontheween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasontheween</a> and fellow VTuber<a href="http://twitch.tv/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ironmouse</a>'s positions as the third and fourth <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-subscribed channels on Twitch</a>. The only two channels that have ever beaten that achievement are<a href="http://twitch.tv/evelone2004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Evelone2004</a>, with 459,924 subscribers, and<a href="http://twitch.tv/kaicenat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> KaiCenat</a> with 1,112,947 subscribers.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Neuro-sama and Evil, they are twin VTubers that utilize a large language model to communicate with their creator Vedal987's Twitch chat and play games. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU, but evolved quickly to become a series of AI systems that work in tandem thanks to the knowledge of programmer Vedal. By taking an input from Twitch and from voice, giving that input to the LLM, and converting it via a text-to-speech system, the twins can interact with their viewers. If you're interested in learning more, I'd really recommend the explainer video by <a href="https://youtu.be/wZ0osmPlSaY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Creative Every Day</a> on YouTube.</p><p>With under one full day remaining of the subathon, it seems there are not many more Twitch records for the trio to achieve. But with a community as dedicated as theirs, who knows what comes next?</p>
