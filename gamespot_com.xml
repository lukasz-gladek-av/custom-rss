                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser may have included an advanced AI as a plot in his new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise: Volume One - An Aftermath</a>, but he's not as impressed with the current state of the technology. During a recent appearance, Houser didn't completely downplay AI, but he noted that the technology isn't everything some of its proponents have made it out to be.</p><p>While making a guest appearance on Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>, Houser acknowledged that his upcoming video game based on A Better Paradise may have some AI. But he also warned that the technology behind AI can't live up to its biggest promises yet.</p><p>"We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is a lot of it's not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet," said Houser. "It's not going to solve all of the problems, you know. We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI is great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet."</p><p>Houser was subsequently asked about the future of gaming now that AI technology is part of it, and he suggested it will land somewhere between art and commerce. </p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," said Houser. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>When asked if he thought the pursuit of money or creativity would win in the end, Houser clarified that both will win.</p><p>"I think there will be two parts," said Houser. "I've already seen that in spaces in the games industry where they both kind of win."</p><p>Earlier this month, Ubisoft was called out for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI-created art</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana/" data-ref-id="5000-632093">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. Activision was less contrite when taken to task for the apparently AI-created "Ghibli-style" Calling Cards seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The company subsequently acknowledged that some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7</a> Meanwhile, Arc Raiders has come under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI voiceover readings</a>. Congressman Ro Khanna subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">called for regulation</a> over the use of AI.</p>

The BlackCell DLC bundles are some of the more expensive Call of Duty offerings, coming in at around $30. They have proven to be very popular with fans, so it's no surprise to see the BlackCell bundles continue with Black Ops 7.</p>
