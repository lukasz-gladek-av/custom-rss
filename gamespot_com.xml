                <p>Making predictions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is a bit tricky considering that the game is still at least 10 months away. It's not a question about whether GTA 6 will be a hit, hit, but how big and how far the impact will be felt. Video game venture capitalist firm Konvoy recently released its projections for GTA 6, and it's predicting that Rockstar Games' latest title will reach $7.6 billion in revenue just 60 days after launch.</p><p>Josh Chapman--a managing partner of Konvoy--shared the company's GTA 6 forecast on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a> earlier this week. Konvoy's analysis makes certain assumptions that have yet to be confirmed by Rockstar, including an $80 base price and a $2 billion budget for the game itself. Those numbers are still conjecture, and the CEO of Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">Strauss Zelnick, recently said</a> that there is "way more value to a consumer than whatever that consumer pays," as opposed to "what the top-line price is."</p><p>Regardless, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will recoup its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and go on to become the biggest gaming launch of all time while shattering records for copies sold and revenue generated. By the end of the second month, Konvoy predicts that the game's total revenue will be $7.6 billion.</p><p>Intriguingly, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will introduce a new UGC platform that allows mod creators to build their own areas of the game which will allow them to potentially be paid for their efforts through a creator economy that mimics UEFN and Roblox.</p><p>One of the last predictions is that GTA 6 will feature 200-person lobbies and a system that allows other players to steal weapons and items from each other.</p><p>Rockstar has been very secretive about GTA 6's details, but at least one leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">Drake will have his own radio station</a> in the game. It's also estimated that the decision to push the game out of 2025 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">will cost the industry $2.7 billion in revenue</a>.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

                <p>CD Projekt Red has lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-cyberpunk-2077-updates-were-thought-to-be-done-but-2-3-patch-launches-soon/1100-6532138/" data-ref-id="1100-6532138">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3</a>, revealing several of the big features coming to its open-world game. In a livestream featuring Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and several other members of the team, the studio showed off how the new update is primarily aimed at making Night City feel even more immersive by adding new vehicles, an AutoDrive feature, and even more features for the game's photo mode. The update will launch on July 17 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/" data-ref-id="1100-6532688">and it'll land on Switch 2 at a later date</a>.</p><p>Here's a quick breakdown of everything revealed during the stream.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</a></li><li><a href="#AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</a></li><li><a href="#Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</a></li><li><a href="#Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</a></li><li><a href="#More_cars_can_use_CrystalCoat">More cars can use CrystalCoat</a></li><li><a href="#Everything_else">Everything else</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</h2><p>Gearheads can add three new cars and another motorcycle to V's garage once they complete several quests. Sasko added that these quests won't count towards earning a 100% completion rate in the game, and activating them will be easy to do. Here's the full list of new vehicles to collect via new side-jobs:</p><p><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Hunt and The Beast In Me. An additional side-job unlocks the CrystalCoat feature for it.</p><p><strong>Rayfield Caliburn Mordred</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search &amp; Destroy.</p><p><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></p><p>Unlocked after purchasing one Yaiba vehicle, purchasing three vehicles through Autofixer, and completing the side-job Reported Crime: You Play with Fire.</p><p><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></p><p>Available for purchase through Autofixer.</p><h2 id="AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</h2><p>Feel like admiring the sights and sounds of Night City from inside one of your favorite cars? You'll be able to do just that with the AutoDrive feature, allowing you to go hands-free as you cruise around. This new mode--added to your rides as part of an in-universe software update--will turn your car into a self-driving vehicle and it follows the rules of the road when active. You'll need to be on a road to make use of it, but it looks like a nice option for getting around the city.</p><p>This function also has a "wandering" mode for going nowhere slowly, and it works with motorcycles. If you're attacked, it automatically deactivates. There's also a new "Cinematic Camera" that you can activate so that you can view your driving session from unusual angles.</p><h2 id="Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</h2><p>For backseat tourism, you can now call Cyberpunk 2077's favorite AI program, Delamain, to dispatch one of its taxis to you, for a small fee. This feature unlocks after completing the job Don't Lose Your Mind.</p><h2 id="One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2077's already expansive photo mode is being further improved with new options. You can choose from 27 new NPCs, set the time of day, and adjust the weather to help you nail that perfect snapshot. New stickers and frames are also being added, the depth-of-field option has been improved, and a new Color Balance tab will let you to create your own custom filters.</p><h2 id="Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</h2><p>For those of you looking to get the most graphical bang for your buck, Cyberpunk 2077 will support AMD FSR 3.1 once the update has been installed, and FSR 4 support is coming at a later date. On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, VRR support will be added.</p><h2 id="More_cars_can_use_CrystalCoat">More cars can use CrystalCoat</h2><p>Like what you see on the road? The CrystalCoat cosmetic option is rolling out to more vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles, and this will allow you to update your ride with more custom colors. Several lower-end vehicles can also make use of this cosmetic feature.</p><h2 id="Everything_else">Everything else</h2><p>Rounding out the update is a long list of tweaks and quality-of-life changes to Cyberpunk 2077. These include addressing several issues from side-jobs, improving the HDR setting screen, and fixing several visual issues in the game.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life &amp; Accessibility</strong></p><ul><li>The game will now detect if the player is using inverted mouse button settings and automatically adjusts in-game button prompts accordingly.</li><li>Added an option to toggle aiming down sights in Settings--Controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Jobs &amp; Open World</strong></p><ul><li>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Bloody Ritual - the "Crack the ritualist's shard" objective now properly disappears from the Journal after completing the objective.</li><li>Sex on Wheels - now properly appears in the Journal after receiving the message from Jake Estevez.</li><li>Shot by Both Sides - fixed an issue where selecting a specific dialogue option in the conversation with Bree created a nameless, iconless item in the player's Inventory.</li><li>Shot by Both Sides--fixed an issue where the button to go to the lower level didn't appear on the elevator panel.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when using a controller in Trauma Drama, the controllable character would default to shooting upwards instead of forward.</li><li>Players can now drop more Cyberware Capacity Shards if some within the intended drop limit were previously missed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing automatic weapons to fire slower than intended.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Official BARGHEST Tac Vest didn't drop from the scripted Airdrop as intended.</li><li>The level 60 Engineer perk no longer activates the EMP blast outside of combat or after entering a vehicle.</li><li>Added an option to replay the gameplay tutorial at any time via Settings--Controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><ul><li>Added an option to tell Johnny to go away after you look at him for a short while when he appears in the passenger seat. He takes the hint and disappears as a passenger for a couple days.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the sound of V's Radioport could be randomly interrupted by the Radioports of nearby NPCs.</li><li>Fixed an issue where History by Gazelle Twin and Trash Generation played too loudly compared to other songs on the radio.</li><li>Improved the HDR Setting screen: fixed the HDR calibration preview so it correctly reflects the chosen settings, and clarified the description of the "Tone-Mapping Midpoint" setting.</li><li>Updated the End User Licence Agreement. You will be asked to accept it again when you load the game after updating.</li><li>Fixed several visual issues with missing, clipping, or floating textures.</li><li>Fixed several localization issues in various languages.</li></ul>

                <p>A new music video from Jackboys &amp; Travis Scott seemingly contains a reference to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, prompting fans to theorize that the "Sicko Mode" singer may have some involvement in the Rockstar game.</p><p>At the end of the video for "2000 Excursion," a car with the license plate "GTA VI6" can be seen prominently. Not only that, but it appears to be a Florida license plate, which is notable because GTA 6 takes place in Vice City, a stand-in for Miami, Florida. Have a look for yourself:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwuYa2DcC-o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dwuYa2DcC-o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The GTA 6 reference doesn't necessarily mean anything, but Scott does have a history of partnering with video game companies. In 2020, Scott teamed up with Epic Games for an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/travis-scott-played-a-fortnite-concert-heres-how-i/1100-6476459/" data-ref-id="1100-6476459">epic Fortnite concert</a>, scoring himself a reported <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/11/30/how-hip-hop-superstar-travis-scott-has-become-corporate-americas-brand-whisperer/?sh=5e94aa0674e7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 million.</a></p><p>It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">DJ Khaled and Drake might feature in GTA 6 with their own in-game radio stations</a>. Nothing is confirmed, yet, but Rockstar does have a history of working with real musicians for their own radio stations, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">Roy Ayers in GTA 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean in GTA 5.</a></p><p>GTA 6 was previously slated to release this year before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed it to May 26, 2026.</a></p><p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game," Rockstar said.</p><p>It was reported that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fall 2025 was not a "real window" for the game</a>, and that a slip to 2026 was inevitable. Rockstar management is reportedly keen to avoid a "brutal crunch" for GTA 6.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be a blockbuster success, with one company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million in sales in the first year alone.</a> The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corsair-ceo-believes-grand-theft-auto-6-will-hit-pc-in-early-2026/1100-6529520/" data-ref-id="1100-6529520">expected to come to PC at a later date</a>, creating a second selling cycle for the open-world game.</p><p>GTA 6 being delayed into 2026 is tough news for the overall gaming market, too, as one research firm predicted that the video game industry was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">relying on GTA 6 in 2025 to help turn things around.</a></p>

The trailer also reveals the rest of the cast, including BAFTA winner Jane Perry (Returnal, Hitman) and Alannah Pearce (Cyberpunk 2077, V/H/S/Beyond).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXhJB9ICvfc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aXhJB9ICvfc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Also making cameo appearances in the game are BAFTA winner Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role), Travis Willingham (Marvel Rivals), and CDawgVA (Honkai: Star Rail), as well as game developer Sam Lake, also famously the face of the original Max Payne.</span></p><p>Players take the role of Chase Lowry (Newbon), as he explores a secluded Hollywood mansion to uncover what happened to his close friend Vinny Monroe (Starr). As you explore the mansion, you will also uncover audition tapes, presented as live-action footage, so you can expect actors to be giving screen performances too.</p><p dir="ltr">"Dead Take is about actors,” said creative director Abubakar Salim in a press release. “So we needed actors who’ve lived it. It’s a game about the high of ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out.”</p>
