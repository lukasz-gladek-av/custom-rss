                <p>Konami appears to be a little undecided on what to make next now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> is out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Another remake isn't totally out of the realm of possibility, and neither is something wholly brand new, but series producer Noriaki Okamura said that if Konami were to do another remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/" data-ref-id="5000-23469">Metal Gear Solid 4</a> would be a "pretty hard" one to do.</p><p>Speaking to the Japanese website <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Real Sound</a> (and machine translated by both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-series-producer-remakes-metal-gear-solid-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gears-producer-says-hes-undecided-on-future-remakes-mgs4-would-be-real-challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Okamura said that, while he'd love to build on the momentum that the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake gave him and Konami, the team is still at the decision-making stage about what comes next.</p><p>He expressed that another remake is possible, but so too is something entirely new. After all, with Metal Gear Solid alone, Konami has a rich history to pull from.</p><p>Okamura continued, saying that because much of the original Metal Gear Solid staff no longer works at Konami, the team isn't going to just apply the same coat of paint MGSD got to every remake it develops in the possible future. He was then asked about that future and if a Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots remake was something the team would consider pursuing. It's not a no, but Okamura said it wouldn't be an easy task, particularly because of the unusual designs required to get the 3D performance at the time. Modernizing those assets would be difficult, he concluded.</p><p>Snake Eater and Guns of the Patriots were released just four years apart, but they're actually 50 years from each other in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-games-in-order" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise's official chronological order</a>. If Konami were to consider remaking the series in the order its story goes, then the next game would be 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops/" data-ref-id="5000-26743">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a> for the PSP. (Though I'd personally love to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/" data-ref-id="5000-43546">Revengeance</a> remake/remaster.)</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta is out now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. We awarded it 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>, saying it "successfully modernizes visuals, tweaks game design, and updates controls so that the game sits comfortably alongside its action game contemporaries."</p><p>.</p>

A large voting jury made up of game critics and media decides 90% of the results. The remaining 10% comes from fan votes, so while that doesn't decide everything, your votes can still make a difference when the results are announced live on December 11. What's more, the first round of Players' Voice nominees have been revealed. These are picked exclusively by the general public.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, and fans in China can vote on Bilibili. Voting stays open until December 10, at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET. Anyone <a href="https://thegameawards.com/nominees/game-of-the-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who signs up</a> can vote in all 29 award categories, including Game of the Year.</p><p>On the official The Game Awards website, the organization outlines why the primary award categories are not 100% chosen by the general public.</p><p>"Creating a 100% fan vote presents several challenges. First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles," the organization says <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its website</a>. "In addition, it is important that winners cannot be 'socially engineered' in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners."</p><p>This year's event will celebrate many major games. The Game of the Year nominees are Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades II, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Expedition 33 leads with 12 nominations--the most in The Game Awards history--followed by Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei with seven each. Hades II earned six nominations, Hollow Knight has five, and Split Fiction has four.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The tutorial will show players around the neighborhood, the basics of decorating, and answer some common housing-related questions players may have. As noted in the video, housing is available almost immediately, even for entirely new players. After doing the first few quests in the tutorial zone Exile's Reach, new players will be given the option of continuing with the game's introductory zone or jumping straight into the housing tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to easily see which houses are available for purchase in any given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">neighborhood</a>. There's plenty of housing plot options for all kinds of players, with a variety of different biomes to choose from. Those who want to be more secluded can buy a home farther away from the center of town, while others may want to be closer to the action and have neighbors directly next door.</p><p dir="ltr">If a specific plot is taken, players can simply travel to a different neighborhood until they find one where it's available. A house typically costs 1,000 gold but that already-small fee is waived for brand-new players. Players aren't locked into a specific neighborhood or plot, and can pick up their house (as well as all of its interior and exterior decorations) and move to a new plot or neighborhood at any time for a fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorating, Blizzard is giving players plenty of options</a>. All players will receive a housing starter pack of decor items to get going. Both the inside of a home and the outside plot can be customized with decor items gained from quests, raids, professions, vendors, and more. There are both simple and advanced tools for placing and customizing decor items for those who want to get lost in the details. As players increase their housing level over time, they'll be able to add more rooms to their home and place even more decor.</p><p dir="ltr">For those worried about what happens to their home if they take a break from WoW and let their subscription lapse, the home is never lost. It will be saved as it last was with all of its decorations and customizations and put into storage after a certain amount of time, freeing up whatever neighborhood plot it occupied. Once that player resubscribes to WoW, the home can then be placed back down in a new plot or neighborhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out Blizzard's Housing 101 video above for a more in-depth look, but housing in WoW looks to be remakarbely straightforward compared to how it can be in some other MMOs, where players need to enter a house lottery or pay taxes on their virtual real estate. Housing will be available early for those who preorder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight, with the expansion proper coming on March 2, 2026</a>.
