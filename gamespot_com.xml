                <p dir="ltr">The next game in The Sims franchise--codenamed Project Rene--has turned into a mobile-first experience that's all about social multiplayer. It is not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6510166/">The Sims 5</a>, and developer Maxis states this title can live in harmony with The Sims 4 and any future single-player installments in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis discussed the future of The Sims in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" rel="nofollow ">a blog post</a> celebrating the new year. Within this article, the companies noted that "Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together." In addition, the "mobile-first life-sim game" is about collaboration.</p><p dir="ltr">However, The Sims franchise won't forget about its roots. The blog post states: "At its core, The Sims was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn't going anywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">Originally announced in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-is-now-in-development-heres-a-first-look-at-its-build-mode/1100-6508378/">Project Rene was presumed to be The Sims 5</a>. But that changed in recent years, as EA and Maxis pointed out the in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wont-drop-sims-4-support-when-project-rene-comes-out/1100-6526534/">would complement The Sims 4</a> instead of replacing it. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">The Sims team declared their values wouldn't change</a>, in wake of fan concerns regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA's $55 billion deal</a> with the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund affecting the life-sim series.</p><p>Talk of Project Rene exploring multiplayer concepts emerged in 2023, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-multiplayer-could-be-inspired-by-animal-crossing-or-among-us/1100-6519254/">Animal Crossing and Among Us name-checked as possible inspirations</a>. Now, it's clear, Project Rene is going all in on social multiplayer. Outside of gaming, there is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-movie-from-margot-robbies-production-company-confirmed-will-include-freezer-bunnies/1100-6526524/">a Sims movie in the works</a>.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's The Division is getting a definitive edition, it appears. This would be in addition to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-survivors-announced-ubisoft-says-its-your-baby/1100-6534215/" data-ref-id="1100-6534215"> ongoing updates to The Division 2</a> and a brand-new game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">The Division 3</a>, along with a mobile title called The Division Resurgence.</p><p>Advertising for an unannounced The Division Definitive Edition recently appeared in Japan, though there is no telling if the images are authentic or not. Images also surfaced of new The Division merchandise, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-the-division-definitive-edition-is-on-the-way-10-years-after-its-initial-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> theorized they could be prizes for an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming The Division esports event.</a></p><p>The Division was originally released in 2016, meaning 2026 will mark the game's 10th anniversary. It is one of many anniversaries on tap for 2026, including Donkey Kong (45th anniversary), The Legend of Zelda (40th anniversary), Sonic (35th anniversary), Pokemon (30th anniversary), Resident Evil (30th anniversary), Halo (25th anniversary), and The United States of America (250th anniversary).</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Ubisoft for comment on the supposed The Division Definitive Edition.</p><p>If such a game is real, it could follow the path of other definitive editions and receive visual and performance upgrades, along with the bundling of previously released DLC, among other things. The game was originally released on console for PS4 and Xbox One, so a possible definitive edition could come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. These are just guesses, however. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>As for The Division 3, director Julian Gerighty recently gave an update on the project, saying it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-gearing-up-to-be-a-monster-says-series-executive-producer/1100-6537293/" data-ref-id="1100-6537293">going to be a "monster."</a> The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/" data-ref-id="1100-6517899">announced back in 2023</a> but we still haven't learned much about it, though.</p>
