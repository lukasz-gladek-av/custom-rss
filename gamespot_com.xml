                <p>The isometric gameplay of Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream may not be the adventure game style that you're used to. But this gorgeous title was created by a handful of Mirror's Edge and Battlefield devs who teamed up to bring Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to life. The game is set for a release next month, but you can play it right now with the newly-released demo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQHUcrJLys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Swedish studio River End Games has shared the demo for Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>. The game is set in the early 1900s in a world that's not entirely like our own. The city of Eriksholm has been stricken by an illness called Heartpox, and a young boy named Herman has disappeared under murky circumstances.</p><p>Herman's brother, Hanna, is the lead character in the game, but she'll be joined by two additional characters, Alva and Sebastian, as the story progresses. Each of the three main children have different abilities that can get them past obstacles or out of trouble. But the stakes of their quest are even higher than they realize, and the secrets they uncover may ignite "a chain of catastrophic events that will forever change their lives and the fate of the entire city."</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-developers-on-making-a-game-with-16-people-we-do-these-things-not-because-theyre-easy-but-because-we-thought-theyd-be-easy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the development team behind Eriksholm consisted of only 16 people. Creative Director Anders Hejdenberg acknowledged the inherent difficulty of putting out a fully-fleshed out game with so few people before adding "we do these things not because they're easy, but because we thought they'd be easy."</p><p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on July 15.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, developer Twisted Pixel unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Deadpool VR</a>, the first solo Deadpool video game since 2013. However, Ryan Reynolds will not be reprising his title role from the three previous live-action Deadpool movies. Instead, How I Met Your Mother's Neil Patrick Harris is stepping in to voice Marvel's Merc with a Mouth. Now, Reynolds has shared his response to the news. And if Harris can take one of his roles, then Reynolds will just have to steal one of Harris' iconic characters.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WIhc9hjlTQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2WIhc9hjlTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harris' first breakout role came in the 1989 comedy series, Doogie Howser, M.D., which cast him as a 14-year-old medical prodigy. That's the role that Reynolds spoofs in this video, complete with Doogie's lab coat, glasses, and antiquated computer. The video also features a cameo from Doogie Howser, M.D. co-star, Robyn Lively, who portrayed Michele Farber on the show. Lively is Reynolds' sister-in-law, so presumably it wasn't too hard to get her for this.</p><p>Twisted Pixel has shared a handful of details about Deadpool VR, which will be an original story that sends Deadpool into the Mojoverse, where he'll go up against Mojo himself and Lady Deathstrike. Players will assume control of Deadpool as he uses his particular skills to shoot, stab, and parkour his way out of trouble. But when all else fails, Deadpool does have a healing factor that rivals Wolverine's ability to regenerate from almost any injury. Even getting beheaded hasn't been enough to kill Deadpool in the comics. </p><p>Deadpool VR will be released exclusively on Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR, but the game doesn't currently have a release date yet.</p>

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">declared a video game voice actors strike</a> against the industry's major publishers over several issues, including AI protections for performers. The strike has lingered almost a year, but the end may be in sight. SAG-AFTRA has announced that the actors union has reached a tentative agreement with the video game companies. </p><p>According to SAG-AFTRA's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the strike won't be over until the union members have a chance to go over the deal and vote for its ratification. Specific details about the potential contract or any gains for the actors weren't disclosed in the initial announcement. </p><p>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," said SAG-AFTRA's Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains. Thank you, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Chair Sarah Elmaleh and Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez for your hard work and advocacy in pursuit of this contract."</p><p>Last month, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-voice-of-master-chief-asks-halo-fans-to-stand-up-for-voice-actors-on-strike/1100-6531524/" data-ref-id="1100-6531524">the importance of getting a deal</a> that offers performers assurances that their voices can't be used by AI duplicates without their permission. </p><p>In early May, the video game publishers put forth what they contended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-and-publishers-clash-over-best-and-last-offer-to-end-the-strike/1100-6531336/" data-ref-id="1100-6531336">was "the last, best and final offer" to end the strike</a>. Subsequently, the publishers made what was characterized as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a key concession</a>" on AI, which may have helped wind down the strike after 11 months. The fate of the deal will lie in the hands of the actors once the voting period begins. </p>

                <p>Apple has announced a new dedicated gaming app, Apple Games, which will launch this fall for iPhone, iPad, and Macs. The new app combines the existing Game Center app with the gaming section of the regular App Store, and even has a tab for Apple Arcade.</p><p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games-app/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new app</a> is designed to be an all-in-one destination for gaming on Apple devices--combining easy access to the games store, your purchased gaming library, Apple Arcade, your friends list, and other community features. All games that are available on the App Store will automatically be included in the Apple Games app. Apple Games will replace the Game Center app when it launches this fall, absorbing the social gaming app's features including friends lists, achievement tracking, leaderboards, and more.</p><p>It had been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-planning-to-release-gaming-app-near-nintendo-switch-2s-launch-report/1100-6531858/" data-ref-id="1100-6531858">Apple was working on a gaming app</a> with a release date around the launch of the Switch 2, which was June 5. For now, the app is in beta, and will be launched in full later this year as a default app in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and MacOS 26--Apple's latest operating system updates that were <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previewed</a> this week at WWDC 2025.</p><p>Macs and iPads are also getting further gaming capabilities with Game Overlay. Exactly as it sounds, the new feature introduces an overlay gamers can use to access friend lists, social features, and system settings without having to leave their game.</p><p>The new features are part of a larger gaming push by Apple, which also includes an expanded library of AAA games being released for Mac. Apple has just announced that open-world adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-desert/" data-ref-id="5000-504442">Crimson Desert</a> and Sims-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZOI</a> will be coming to the Mac, alongside other titles including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/" data-ref-id="5000-531947">Lies of P: Overture</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/" data-ref-id="5000-600315">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and more.</p>
