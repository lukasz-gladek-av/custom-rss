                <p>Two prominent video game industry veterans have voiced their opinions on AI, with both people--Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield--declaring that AI should not be feared but embraced.</p><p>Kojima, for his part, said AI is already used in a lot of creative work to "come up with ideas." But Kojima himself sees AI "as more of a friend." Kojima said he would use AI to "boost efficiency" but that he himself would continue to "lead the creative part" of game development.</p><p>"I'd like AI to handle the tedious tasks that would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it," he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=MWp2Y25jcHV1djZvMA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired.</a> "I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI."</p><p>Another game developer who talked about AI recently was Schofield, the Dead Space co-creator and Call of Duty veteran. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he's been tinkering around with generative AI for two years and maintains that it can help "fix" the games industry's issues.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us: It's here to make us better, faster, and more efficient," he said, as reported by <a href="https://x.com/andy_vgc/status/1978676771496063399?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "It's a tool."</p><p>Before this, Schofield talked about how "everybody's spouting out about AI" but he's actually doing work with it. "We're always trying to make it cheaper, more efficient, faster, and better," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-and-dead-space-creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>Regarding fears of job losses, Schofield said he's old enough to remember when people thought the emergence of Photoshop and motion-capture technologies would "take jobs away." However, what Schofield said he's observed over the years is that new technologies create more jobs overall.</p><p>Schofield also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">holds the belief</a> that the massive investments into AI companies and technologies could lead to a bubble, and when it bursts, "a lot of smaller AI companies will disappear," but the "strongest systems will remain." This is not unlike the dot-com bubble, when many internet companies scaled back or went out of business, but those left standing thrived and helped shape the internet of today.</p><p>"I don't buy into the idea that AI will permanently take jobs away. Disruption in the short term? Yes. It hurts. But history shows us that every major technological leap creates whole new industries, opportunities, and specialists," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said in a LinkedIn post</a>. "When cell phones appeared, people worried about operators and pay phones. Instead, we ended up with billions of devices, new apps, streaming, and millions of jobs that didn't exist before. The internet, the PC, even the automobile all followed the same pattern."</p><p>The video game industry has undergone mass layoffs recently, with numerous companies slashing jobs.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>
