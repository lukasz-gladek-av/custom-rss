                <p dir="ltr">Mario Party is a game lots of players love, but often not without reservations. The big knock against the series has long been its late-game antics, which can render strategy meaningless by creating huge swings that can suddenly shuffle the standings, regardless of how well or poorly you've been playing all along. Handing out bonus stars like Oprah gifting her audience with cars just doesn't make for a good virtual board game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also not so predictable which of the many categories of minigames will be involved in any Mario Party endgame moment, and as a result, not always so much fun to play, even while the rest of a session might be enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-party/" data-ref-id="5000-681517">Lego Party</a>, a similar minigame-laden multiplayer party game, is intended to be similar to Mario Party but without that annoyance for players, allowing them to strategize more reliably.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind Lego Party removed the concept of bonus stars (gold bricks in this case) from their take on the party minigame genre, because the team understood that having late-game bonuses that can invalidate playing well in the early game is not an enjoyable mechanic. "I just don't like them," SMG Studio project director Mark Fennell told me bluntly. It feels like randomness added where it doesn't belong. And I can say its absence was appreciated in my Lego Party demo at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2PgTclraWk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A2PgTclraWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only pain point Lego Party seeks to address as a party "board" game. Like in Mario Party, you can steal items, including highly valuable gold bricks, from other players, if the right conditions are met. In Mario Party, you can decline to buy a star when offered, but you can't decline to steal from another player (either a star or coins) if you land on the board game space that says you have to do so. In Lego Party, that's not the case. Since the Lego Party team expects the game to have an audience of players with mixed experience levels, or parents playing with their kids, the change leaves room for the game's older or more mature players to show mercy to younger ones.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did over 100 playtests, and we had some tears," a developer told me, speaking to the times when kids would cry because they'd suffered a loss in the game. Lego Party was re-tuned with this feedback in mind. The option to steal gold bricks can now be declined by the pilfering player. If you're a parent trying to go easy on your kid, you'll have the opportunity <em>not</em> to go through with the action that's going to upset them. It's a nice touch that makes the game kid-friendlier. And of course, if you <em>don't</em> want to go easy on another player, you can just choose not to.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet another small tweak to the rules results in big changes to how games unfold. The player turn order isn't static, like it is in Mario Party, where it's chosen at the beginning of the game. Instead, each turn is given a new order based on the most recent minigame results. If you were just a space away from scoring a star in Mario Party and you're first in the turn order, you can rest assured you'll get it after the next minigame, no matter what happens. In Lego Party, however, you're gonna need to lock in, because the winner of the minigame gains turn priority. That means they could beat you to the gold brick when your group returns to moving around the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party will launch with four boards and over 60 minigames, and those I saw were a fun mix of play styles and objectives. My favorite was one in which players would need to grapple up to a moving platform--a small dancefloor, really--and amass points for staying on it and grooving away. I also saw games like a rally race, a memory test, and a familiar one where players compete for painted space on the ground, constantly painting over each other's brushstrokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party benefits from being recognizable; it's "Mario Party but Lego," for the most part, and though that's a fun proposition, its merits may come down more to how it differs, and in particular, how it improves on Nintendo's long-standing party game.</p>

                <p>Developer Raccoon Logic worked with Microsoft to bring Revenge of the Savage Planet to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one launch title, but studio head Alex Hutchinson said new games launching into Game Pass can "devalue" them and hurt the industry overall.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://gamersocialclub.ca/2025/06/09/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-talks-success-game-pass-the-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamer Social Club</a>, Hutchinson said "most of the traffic" so far for Revenge of the Savage Planet has been from Game Pass, while full-game sales "have been good."

<p>As for bringing the game to Game Pass at launch, Hutchinson said working with Microsoft--and presumably taking payment from the company--was part of Raccoon Logic's balancing effort of trying to reach as many people as possible and making money. The financial terms of Game Pass deals are not made public, but it's understood that Microsoft pays developers to bring their games to Game Pass at launch as part of the Xbox company's ambition to scale the service and attract new users.</p><p>Hutchinson said the "whole industry should agree to only allow games on subscription services a year after release." He said the video game industry should embrace the traditional movie model where a film debuts in theaters exclusively and then comes to DVD, TV, or a streaming service.</p><p>"The current structure will prove very damaging to anyone who is not owned by a publisher soon if it continues," Hutchinson said. <a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1932143109493674096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Hutchinson said Nintendo stands alone with respect to retaining the value of games. "Everyone except Nintendo is also in a race to value content at zero which will end in tears," he said.</p><p>Hutchinson is saying this as a person who took a deal from Microsoft to launch Revenge of the Savage Planet into Game Pass on day one, so what gives? He said the studio's hope with making a deal with Microsoft was to help Revenge of the Savage Planet get exposure that would in turn encourage people to buy a DLC pack or encourage a friend to buy the game. That's not what's happened, though.</p><p>"We haven't seen that, or at least not yet. What we've seen is that content has been devalued and that people are less willing to pay for things, which in the long run will likely mean less games being made and a lot more studios going under," he said.</p><p>As for the Game Pass payments from Microsoft, Hutchinson said it was true that the checks were "big enough to make a difference," but that was "years ago."</p><p>"These days unless your game is tiny, or you're a rare enormous brand, it isn't much. But Microsoft have been amazing partners and we're so glad to be working with them," he said.</p><p>Game Pass is a paradigm shift for gaming, and it's a model that no other major competitor has embraced. For its part, Sony has said it will not launch its new games into PlayStation Plus on day one because of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">how it can erode and negatively impact its overall value chain and ecosystem.</a> Nintendo doesn't have a similar program, either, and is historically known for holding prices, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">in the case of Mario Kart World, increasing prices.</a></p><p>Hutchinson directed Assassin's Creed III and Far Cry 4 while at Ubisoft before leaving to start Typhoon Studios, which released Journey to the Savage Planet in 2020. Google acquired Typhoon for its failed Stadia gaming ambitions, before closing the studio and scuttling Stadia. Hutchinson then founded Raccoon Logic in 2021, releasing Revenge of the Savage Planet in May 2025.</p>

                <p>The isometric gameplay of Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream may not be the adventure game style that you're used to. But this gorgeous title was created by a handful of Mirror's Edge and Battlefield devs who teamed up to bring Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to life. The game is set for a release next month, but you can play it right now with the newly-released demo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQHUcrJLys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Swedish studio River End Games has shared the demo for Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>. The game is set in the early 1900s in a world that's not entirely like our own. The city of Eriksholm has been stricken by an illness called Heartpox, and a young boy named Herman has disappeared under murky circumstances.</p><p>Herman's brother, Hanna, is the lead character in the game, but she'll be joined by two additional characters, Alva and Sebastian, as the story progresses. Each of the three main children have different abilities that can get them past obstacles or out of trouble. But the stakes of their quest are even higher than they realize, and the secrets they uncover may ignite "a chain of catastrophic events that will forever change their lives and the fate of the entire city."</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-developers-on-making-a-game-with-16-people-we-do-these-things-not-because-theyre-easy-but-because-we-thought-theyd-be-easy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the development team behind Eriksholm consisted of only 16 people. Creative Director Anders Hejdenberg acknowledged the inherent difficulty of putting out a fully-fleshed out game with so few people before adding "we do these things not because they're easy, but because we thought they'd be easy."</p><p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on July 15.</p>
