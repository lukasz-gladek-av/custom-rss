                <p>At GDC 2025, I watched a walkthrough of one of the early levels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>, the next game from Heart Machine. The studio typically goes for action games but mixes in a little bit of something else--2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a> had RPG elements, 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a> was an adventure-platformer, and 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a cooperative roguelike. Possessor(s) is a metroidvania or, as Heart Machine prefers to call it, a search-action game (which, honestly, is such a better term for the genre).</p><p dir="ltr">A sidescroller, Possessor(s) sees you play as two characters: Luca, a teenage girl, and Rehm, the demon possessing her. I didn't get to see the events that led to their partnership, but the Heart Machine team explained that the start of Possessor(s) sees Luca caught up in an interdimensional catastrophe that rips a hole in the sky and kills everyone she loves--it's only because of the intervention of the strange horned man now within her that she survives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289"></a><figcaption>During Luca and Rehm's journey, they'll encounter objects possessed by feral demons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rehm also gives Luca artificial legs (I don't know what happened to her original legs, but I assume the full game will clue us in), so that she can jump higher and survive falls from any height, and Luca uses these new prosthetics to navigate the now-quarantined city in hopes of escaping it and learning more about how the catastrophe happened. The duo regularly converse about their substantially different views of demons and the corporation responsible for most everything in the city, alleviating much of the sense of loneliness that I've come to expect in other search-action games.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Rehm, Luca is able to hold her own in a world that wants to kill her. Combat is against the possessed objects and people of the city--demons far more feral than Rehm have corrupted all manner of things in the metropolis. I was surprised when a potted plant that had been pretending to be totally inanimate and harmless sprung to life right as Luca walked past it, and the devs said that plenty of demons will adopt that strategy of hiding in plain sight by pretending to be seemingly normal parts of the world. When a fight does break out, mechanically, it looks a whole lot like playing Super Smash Bros., with an emphasis on combos and air juggles. It looks more engaging than Hyper Light Breaker, but I didn't get hands-on time with Possessor(s) so I can't say one way or the other for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290"></a><figcaption>As Luca unlocks new traversal abilities, she and Rehm will be able to reach more areas of the map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its genre contemporaries, Luca unlocks additional abilities over time, which open up new options in combat and open up new areas of the map. I didn't get a chance to see this in action, but it sounds like it works just like how upgrades are handled in the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nine-sols/" data-ref-id="5000-548741">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a>, and other similar games, with an open-ended, interconnected world that allows players to explore in whichever direction they have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Stylistically, Possessor(s) is the biggest departure from Hyper Light Drifter's visuals--not bad by any means, but surprising all the same since every subsequent game from the studio has followed that art direction pretty closely. The colors are certainly similar, but Possessor(s)'s characters look hand-drawn, and bolder lines and flashier colors for the animations make attacks and movements appear like something from a comic book or manga. It's very cool, and at least in terms of art direction, Possessor(s) is my favorite of Heart Machine's games. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the game intrigues me all the same, and I can't wait to jump into it myself later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) is set to launch for PS5 and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

Those who earn the most points after the challenge concludes will be rewarded with prizes.</p><p>Sony San Diego has collaborated with the American sports and comedy group Dude Perfect for this week's Impossible Fastball Challenge of the Week. It'll run from April 4 at 12 PM PT / 3PM ET to April 11 at 11:59 AM PT / 2:59 AM ET. Players will need an internet connection and must be at least 18 years old to win the prizes:</p><ul><li>1st place: Paul Skenes autographed The Show ball</li><li>2nd place: Elly De La Cruz autographed The Show ball</li><li>3rd place: Gunner Henderson autographed The Show ball</li><li>4th – 10th place: 50,000 Stubs</li><li>11th – 20th place: 40,000 Stubs</li><li>21st – 40th place: 30,000 Stubs</li><li>41st – 100th place: 10 Challenge of the Week Exclusive Packs</li></ul><p>Players will play as Elly De La Cruz against a CPU-controlled Paul Skenes who throws a 200MPH fastball and rack up as many points as possible within three outs. GameSpot has attempted this challenge and it seems like players will literally need to swing the instant the pitch leaves Paul Skenes' hand in order to make contact with the ball.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 is now available on PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>TikTok's fate in the US will not be decided just yet. US President Donald Trump said today that he will sign an executive order that will keep the social media site running in the US for another 75 days. This is coming about amid reports of Amazon and Walmart reportedly gearing up to make bids to buy the company.</p><p>In January 2025, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-states-supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban/1100-6528877/" data-ref-id="1100-6528877">US Supreme Court upheld TikTok's ban</a>, and the platform briefly went dark. At the time, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find a US buyer until April 4, and now he's extended this again for another 75 days, ending June 18.</p><p>Today, Trump said he wants to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-china-bytedance-social-media-tariffs-665e46fd5bb555e97c4d7301e07230df?taid=67f01fc15dd9020001502013&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"save TikTok"</a> and that there has been "tremendous progress" thus far in the process of trying to find a buyer. However, he said a deal needs more time to come together, so he's signing a new executive order that will keep TikTok online in the US for at least another 75 days.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about national security over TikTok based on the company's ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. How a potential sale of TikTok might come together remains a mystery, whether it comes as a sale of TikTok's US operations, the platform entirely, or some other kind of deal beyond a total divestiture by ByteDance.</p><p>ByteDance is holding steady and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban-if-not-sold-by-chinese-trump-has-promised-a-solution" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying over and over that it will not sell.</a></p><h2><strong>Who Could Buy TikTok?</strong></h2><p>If TikTok were to be sold, who might buy the company? It was previously reported that Activision founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980?AID=11557093&amp;PID=5835937&amp;SID=01HW8CZB4VGN2YZN49J1WFXY5Q&amp;subid=digidip&amp;cjevent=c4115b2d025211ef810600720a82b824&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=digidip&amp;tier_4=3743973&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fwhy-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bobby Kotick was assembling an investment group to buy TikTok</a>. The AI company Perplexity has also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discussed a potential deal</a> that would give the US government a 50% ownership stake in TikTok. Microsoft, meanwhile, is apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trump-says-microsoft-is-one-of-multiple-companies-eyeing-tiktok-purchase/1100-6529061/" data-ref-id="1100-6529061">interested in trying--again--to buy TikTok.</a></p><p>More recently, it emerged that Amazon and Walmart were entertaining making bids, or joining coalitions of companies in making bids, to buy TikTok. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/walmart-buying-tiktok-sources/story?id=120494441" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News reported</a> that Walmart was motivated to jump into the mix after Amazon, in part to obtain access to TikTok's massive userbase that Walmart could, in theory, sell products to.</p><p>Trump's messaging around TikTok is just the latest big story about how his policies are impacting entertainment products and services. His newly announced tariffs, for example, have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">led Nintendo to delay Switch 2 preorders</a>, sparking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">fears that the Switch 2 could end up being more expensive than anticipated.</a></p><p>For more, check out the story below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">Will Tariffs Increase Switch 2's Price?

                <p>A Minecraft Movie is now available in theaters, and while it's pulling in mixed reviews from critics, it seems to be a hit with both fans and younger viewers alike.
