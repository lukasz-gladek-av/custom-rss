                <p dir="ltr">A Fall Guys player has officially claimed the Guinness World Record for the most overall wins in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, marking the end of a years-long obsession that saw him pour thousands of hours into the game show battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">According to<a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/727399-most-overall-wins-in-fall-guys-ultimate-knockout" rel="nofollow "> Guinness World Records</a>, the player, who goes by the name Magic_Bigos, achieved an unprecedented 150,000 crowns after nearly five years of dedication.</p><p dir="ltr">"I started playing in 2020 casually," they told GameSpot via message. "Then in late December 2021, when I had like 550 crowns, I started grinding a show called Finals Marathon [...] I was playing every single minute of my free time, refusing to play other games even if a friend wanted to."</p><p dir="ltr">By April 2022, he had achieved the game’s Golden Knight costume, a symbol of prestige among fans. He quit the game several times throughout his journey, only to come back to the grind.</p><p dir="ltr">"I wanted to reach top 1 Europe or top 10 world," they wrote. "But deep down I was really dreaming of claiming the top-1 spot."</p><p dir="ltr">That dream turned into a grueling marathon of near-constant play. During one stretch in 2023, he played Fall Guys for 15 hours a day across the entire summer. His parents even grounded him after he went without sleep for two school nights. He came back to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">After submitting screenshots, videos, and leaderboard evidence, his Guinness record was confirmed on September 10, 2025. Yet when he shared the achievement on the Fall Guys subreddit, the reaction wasn’t all celebratory--many accused him of using in-game glitches. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/1nlzyzj/finally_got_my_guinness_world_record_after_9000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> includes a picture of his certificate and a number of comments that accused him of cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">"I used glitches," they wrote. "My main opponent who was #1 at the time used them too, so I had no other choice if I wanted to surpass him."</p><p dir="ltr">Though he says he’s since quit the game, he calls the journey "a phenomenon," adding that he's never been motivated like this before.</p>

<p>"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen," he said. "It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."</p><p>Marathon had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-update-allows-players-to-talk-about-the-game/1100-6530975/" data-ref-id="1100-6530975">an initial closed alpha test</a> in late April that resulted in a smattering of issues, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">an alleged toxic work culture at Bungie</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">stolen-art allegations</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">an indefinite delay out</a> of its September 23 release date. Meanwhile, Arc Raiders had a successful playtest, raking in 189,668 concurrent players and dominating Steam's top 10 most-played games during that "server slam" weekend.</p><p>For Watkins, the disparity between Arc Raiders and Marathon provided Embark Studios the chance to learn about the genre, player expectations, and the game the team is building. Of course, Watkins isn't dragging Marathon despite it not receiving a warm welcome from Bungie and extraction shooter fans. Instead, he's rooting for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> makers, saying Marathon's art style is "evocative" and that he wants to see more from Bungie.</p><p>"[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he said. "[...] I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."</p>

                <p>Escape from Duckov, a new PvE top-down shooter that is something of a parody of Escape from Tarkov, is doing quite well on Steam. The duck-themed game launched on October 16 and quickly shot up the Steam charts, going on to sell more than 500,000 copies.</p><p>It is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 4 best-selling game right now globally on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 6 overall for peak concurrent players</a> today, October 20. It has reached more than 180,000 concurrent players.</p><p>Developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Team%20Soda&amp;snr=1_5_9__2000" rel="nofollow ">Team Soda</a> said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020/view/617681009992795859?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> that it was an "exciting weekend for all ducks," adding that the entire studio is "quacking with joy and flapping our wings in excitement."</p><p>"We'll keep working hard to make sure every update lives up to your expectations!" the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewmV79zP5XQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ewmV79zP5XQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1979966966447177783" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analyst Daniel Ahmad reminded people</a> that Duckov was made by a team of five people, which makes the game's success even more impressive. The game is published by bilibili, a Chinese giant also behind titles like Magicraft, Core Keeper, and Warm Snow.</p><p>Duckov's release wasn't entirely smooth, though, as Team Soda acknowledged an issue with the Mac version of the game that leads to cloud saves getting lost. The developer said it was due to an "operational error on our end," and the team apologized and announced how to address this, or seek a refund.</p><h3>For Mac players who have not yet experienced save loss:</h3><ul><li>Open your ​​local save file folder: ~/Library/Application Support/TeamSoda/Duckov/</li><li>Copy save files​​ and ​​back them up​​ to a safe location (e.g., Desktop or Cloud).</li><li>Start the game on Steam​​ and ​​wait for cloud sync to complete​​.</li><li>After sync is finished, ​​return your backed-up save files​​ to the original folder</li></ul><h3>For Mac players who have already lost save data:</h3><p>"We're truly sorry for the frustration this has caused, and we want to help however we can. You can request a ​​refund directly through the Steam platform​​. When submitting your request, please include the following note: 'Save file loss due to cloud save issue' and screenshot of the announcement.</p><p>Steam may deny refunds in some cases, and if that happens, Team Soda said affected players can email the developer a screenshot of their SteamID and playtime on a Mac device, along with a proof of purchase for the game. More details are available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the game's Steam page.</a></p><p>Duckov is available now for $15.83 USD, but the price will go up 12% to $18 USD on October 30.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 co-director Naoki Hamaguchi has responded to criticism about the pacing of the first two games in the trilogy. Addressing fan complaints of certain sections in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth being too long, Hamaguchi said that the development team was "striking a balance" with regard to the overall pacing of the upcoming threequel.</p><p>While Hamaguchi felt these segments were as long as they needed to be for the game, he did acknowledge that modern-day Final Fantasy fans are currently spoiled for choice when it comes to video games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Biggest Changes In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p>
      </div>
<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," Hamaguchi said to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play--so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly. As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Development on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</a> kicked off at full speed following the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in 2024. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Square Enix is aiming to deliver a "high-quality" finale</a>, and the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">expected to launch for multiple platforms</a>. Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">will be launching for Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> early next year, with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving at a later date that has not yet been revealed.</p><p>Meanwhile, PS5 owners who haven't checked the games out yet can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-REBIRTH-Physical/dp/B0FVGHMMMQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</a> ahead of its release on December 4.</p>
