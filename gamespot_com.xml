The former Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios president recently opened up about plans for Soul Sacrifice 2 and Freedom Wars 2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-claims-2-fan-favourite-ps-vita-games-were-getting-sequels-before-the-transition-to-ps4/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> reports that Yoshida appeared on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-128985225?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> and discussed how sequels were in the works for both Vita exclusives at one point. "We were actually working on Soul Sacrifice 2 and Freedom Wars 2, but because of budget limitation we had to stop and move on to PS4," Yoshida said on the podcast.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED — Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soul-sacrifice-review/1900-6407884/">Soul Sacrifice</a> launched in 2013 for PS Vita and came from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keiji-inafunes-soul-sacrifice-headed-to-us/1100-6379783/">a concept created by former Mega Man designer Keiji Inafune</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-wars-review/1900-6415969/">Freedom Wars</a> arrived the following year in 2014 for the handheld. Both Vita exclusives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-sacrifice-monster-hunter-in-different-clothing/1100-6396876/">featured Monster Hunter-like similarities</a>, which is notable because Capcom's popular franchise skipped the Sony handheld after being a juggernaut on PlayStation Portable. Nintendo was able to secure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-headed-to-3ds-in-early-2015/1100-6417343/">Monster Hunter 4 as an exclusive for 3DS</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The online <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vita-exclusives-freedom-wars-soul-sacrifices-servers-shut-down-next-month/1100-6498377/">servers for Soul Sacrifice and Freedom Wars were shut down</a> in 2021. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-vita-exclusives-is-getting-remastered/1100-6526546/">Freedom Wars Remastered launched</a> earlier this year, providing a new way to play the game on PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>As for Yoshida, he's been showing up on other podcasts recently, too. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/">Yoshida stated that certain $80 games could be a steal</a> because of the hours of entertainment they provide.</p>

Ubisoft is increasing the minimum, high, and ultra PC- spec requirements alongside the launch of Siege X, which it detailed in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497260" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497260"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg"></figure><h2>Rainbow Six Siege X PC Specs</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen3 3100, Intel i3 8100</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB, AMD RX 5500XT 4GB, INTEL ARC A380 6GB</li><li>Ram: 8GB</li><li>OS: Windows 10/11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 65 GB SSD</li></ul><h3>High</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen5 3600, Intel i5 10400, AMD Ryzen7 3700X, Intel i5 11600K</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 6GB, NVIDIA RTX 3070 8GB, NVIDIA RTX 3080 10 GB, AMD RX 6600 8GB, AMD RX 6700 XT 8GB, AMD RX 6800 XT 16 GB</li><li>Ram: 16 GB</li><li>OS: Windows 11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 65 GB SSD</li></ul><h3>Ultra</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen5 5600X, Intel i5-11600K</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB, AMD RTX 7900 XT 20GB</li><li>Ram: 16 GB</li><li>OS: Windows 11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 110 GB SS</li></ul><p>Additionally, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/t63XgnGFUidxcAZQiPqoe/rainbow-six-siege-x-and-operation-daybreak-year-10-roadmap-reveal-details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft teased</a> what's to come throughout the rest of Year 10. Siege X launches alongside a new season called Operation Daybreak. It redesigns the Defender Operator named Clash, who can now deploy her shield and activate its taser remotely. Operation Daybreak also brings other balancing updates to the game, such as electricity slowing Operators rather than damaging them now, reducing limb damage, and adjusting the abilities of Blackbeard, Jackal, Jäger, Thunderbird, and Sledge. The developers also plan to be more efficient in making anti-cheat updates throughout the season.</p><p>When Season 3 arrives several months from now, it will introduce a new Operator to the game, who is from Switzerland and wields a new weapon. It will also remaster the Nighthaven, Lair, and Consulate maps, feature the return of a Halloween event, and bring some changes to Dual Front to set up the new Operator. Then, Rainbow Six Siege will celebrate its 10th anniversary during Season 4, so Ubisoft will have a special in-game event for it. More Operator and map remasters, updates to training mode, and a new playlist called Testing Grounds will also arrive in Season 4.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X and Operation Daybreak will launch on June 10 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A test server for Siege X will run between May 20 and June 9.</p>

According to one prominent dataminer from the MultiVersus community, however, they may not have to look far--Injustice 3 may be on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">MultiverSusie, a well-known dataminer and leaker in the MultiVersus community recently posted a cryptic message to social media platform X that specifically uses the word "injustice" three times. She followed that post up with another that simply wrote the number "3" and nothing else.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice<br>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</p>  — MultiverSusie (@multiversusie) <a href="https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"[M]ultiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice," MultiverSusie's post wrote.

The Definitive Edition bundle has led many in the Mortal Kombat community to assume that development of Mortal Kombat 1, which was rumored to have been halted by WB earlier this year, has indeed ended.</p><p dir="ltr">The Injustice 3 rumors come months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">Warner Bros. shuttered three game studios</a>, including Middle-earth: Shadow of War developer Monolith Productions and MultiVersus developer Player First Games.

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, confirming the push was less than six months, while he stressed that another delay is unlikely.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBlLUo11qWg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said GTA 6's delay was "pretty short," amounting to "less than six months."</p><p>GTA 6's new release date is May 26, 2026. Six months prior to that is November 26, 2025. Rockstar never confirmed a specific GTA 6 release date, only stating that it would come out in Fall 2025. If the delay was less than six months, as Zelnick said, this suggests the company was originally eyeing a late-November or December release date for GTA 6. But of course, nothing is absolutely confirmed on that front.</p><p>Now that GTA 6 has a specific release date, Zelnick said it's unlikely that the game will be delayed again. "Generally, when we announce a date, we're able to hit that date," he said.</p><p>A delay for GTA 6 was always likely, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past 10+ years has been delayed.</a> It is indeed true that when Take-Two announces a specific date--not a vague release window--that the company sticks to its plans. That's not <em>always </em>true, though. GTA V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S edition, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-delayed-to-march-2022-new-trailer-shown-at-playstation-showcase/1100-6496035/#:~:text=GTA%205%20On%20PS5%20And,Shown%20At%20PlayStation%20Showcase%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6496035">given a November 11, 2021 release date before shifting to March 2022.</a></p><p>For GTA 6, Zelnick said Rockstar's ambition to create something truly special is an effort that takes time.</p><p>"Rockstar is trying to create the best thing anyone has ever seen in entertainment. Not just interactive entertainment. That's a tall order," he added.</p><h2>"I don't play video games"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick was asked if he's played GTA 6. He apparently has not, as the executive replied, "I'm not a gamer. I don't play video games."</p><p>Zelnick said he does share his opinions "pretty openly" about what he sees with regards to game designs and concepts. However, he said his job as Take-Two's CEO is to attract, motivate, and retain the video game industry's best talent, and then to "get out of their way."</p><p>In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that the studio may be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2.</a></p>

Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future. As an example, 2K is charging $50 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach the widest possible audience</a>. Yoshida said every game has a "different value [that] it provides," so a game company will decide how to price their product based on the "value that they believe they are bringing in."</p><p>He went on to say that a "really great" game that's priced at $70 or $80 would be a "steal in terms of the amount of entertainment" provided, and the quality of the experience compared to other forms of entertainment.</p><p>"As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining," he said.</p><p>Nintendo defended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price point by stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">the game is simply worth that much given what it offers</a>. MK World is the only confirmed $80 game so far, from Nintendo or anyone else, but Microsoft has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will charge $80 for some Xbox games later this year. </a> Electronic Arts, for its part, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">will not charge $80 for new games</a>, at least not yet.</p><p>Data shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to spend $80 or more on new games.</a></p>
