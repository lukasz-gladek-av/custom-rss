                <p>In classic Call of Duty fashion, the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> is getting a Monster Energy Drink promotional campaign. While the game is still a few months off, special Black Ops 7-themed cans are now appearing in stores.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1949559165476896948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, Black Ops 7 cans are already available for purchase in convenience stores across the United States. In addition to Call of Duty colors and aesthetics, the cans also boast QR codes that will likely take purchasers to a website to input a special code hidden on the can.</p><p>Right now, the QR code simply takes you to the landing page for the old promo for Black Ops 6, suggesting that these cans are getting out into the wild a bit earlier than anticipated. Chances are good that you'll be able to snag some Double XP for the new game if you get your hands on one of these.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year, and it will mark the first-ever back-to-back releases for a Call of Duty sub-series. It's in co-development at Treyarch and Raven Software, and it'll star Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason, Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) as Mike Harper.</p><p>Besides these details and a short teaser trailer that Microsoft showed off at Summer Game Fest, we don't know much about the game--but that'll change soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">Black Ops 7 will have a full reveal at Gamescom</a> in mid-August. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-continues-franchises-obsession-with-weed/1100-6533294/" data-ref-id="1100-6533294">There may also be a big Call of Duty event in September</a>, although Microsoft has yet to confirm this.</p>

                <p>Due to pressure from payment processors and right-wing advocacy groups, the marketplaces Itch.io and Steam recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">they would be delisting or de-indexing games that were perceived as "Not Safe For Work."</a> While apparently intended to disrupt the production and marketing of adult-content games, this move has already had a much broader impact: The critically acclaimed horror game Mouthwashing has been de-indexed from Itch.io as part of this sweep. </p><p>Martin Halldin, who works on audio and music for Mouthwashing developer Wrong Organ, posted on Bluesky that the title had been de-indexed from Itch.io. Halldin wrote that the game is currently still accessible if you have the link--it hasn't been fully removed yet--but not showing up in search results can still have a devastating impact on indie titles.  </p><p>After its launch in 2024, Mouthwashing racked up extensive acclaim and a number of end-of-year accolades. Its Steam reviews are sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive with over 28,000 user reviews submitted--a remarkable total for a game created by a small and previously unknown team. It is a psychological horror game, and the developer itself even warns on the product page that Mouthwashing contains "extreme violence, gore, mutilation and worse on PSX-style characters." </p><p>Despite its obviously mature content and themes, Mouthwashing does not contain pornography and is not sexually explicit--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">which was ostensibly the main target of the campaign organized by advocacy group Collective Shout.</a> Despite the group's declared focus on preventing the depiction of "sexual abuse" in games, the campaign's impact has been to seemingly induce a much broader push to "de-risk" from <em>all </em>adult content, no matter its subject. As a result, horror games and other titles depicting subjects far afield from anything sexual have also been affected. <span><br></span></p><p>Developers and fans of affected games have been attempting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to organize counter-pressure</a> to encourage payment processors to reverse their stance. Civil liberties NGOs like the ACLU have already joined the fight, too; the ACLU, for instance, <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently soliciting signatures for a petition against Mastercard</a>.</p>

Shadow of the Erdtree added multiple massive new open world locations, dungeons, and dozens of bosses to the already enormous action RPG--enough content that it could have easily been its own standalone game--so it's no surprise that the expansion is getting its own dedicated art book.</p><p>If you're looking to add it to your collection, you can preorder <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/177294405X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring: Official Art Book Volume III</a> at Amazon now.

These cards activate new powers in Diablo Immortal's Enchanted Planes and Trial of the Hearth game modes. There is also a new Legendary gem, the Manaflux gem, that is inspired by Hearthstone's mana mechanic. It builds mana stacks over time, after which using a skill will play a Hearthstone card like Ragnaros or Acidic Swamp Ooze to decimate enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">While players who want to collect all the cards will need to purchase card packs, Blizzard is giving away some freebies in the form of a promo code (CARDCOLLECT) that can be used to acquire a random card and various other items like gems and crests. Players who login to Diablo Immortal with a character level 10 or higher during the event will also unlock an exclusive Hearthstone card back.</p><p dir="ltr">The event will additionally add new Warcraft-inspired pets like the Core Rager and Lil' Ragnaros, as well as character skins based on Azeroth's most famous power couple, Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind. It's not the first time Diablo Immortal has crossed over with the Warcraft universe, with a previous crossover event adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-getting-a-lich-king-boss-battle-for-wows-20th-anniversary/1100-6527585/" data-ref-id="1100-6527585">Lich King as a boss battle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the leadup to the event's launch, fans over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>) noticed the piece of artwork teasing the Diablo Immortal and Hearthstone crossover looked off. That quickly led to accusations that Blizzard, or perhaps Diablo Immortal's co-developer NetEase, had used generative AI to create the artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">The artwork features a Night Elf (presumably Tyrande) sitting across a tavern table and playing cards, and there are some noticeable oddities. Tyrande's necklace appears to be somewhat melted, the Hearthstone cards look wrong, pieces of toast are just sitting on a table in an odd manner, and the human card player's ear is malformed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not addressed the situation, but it's not the first time it's been accused of using AI art in Hearthstone. Last year the studio <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/blizzard-is-investigating-claims-that-upcoming-hearthstone-hero-skins-are-ai-generated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investigated</a> claims that a batch of upcoming Hearthstone-hero skins were made using AI, and while Blizzard didn't confirm that they were, it did end up removing the skins in question.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal recently added new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-putting-a-new-spin-on-a-classic-diablo-class/1100-6532742/" data-ref-id="1100-6532742">spin on a classic Diablo class</a>, the Druid.

Speaking to Zalkar Saliev on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHXIW37NBM&amp;ab_channel=ZalkarSaliev">YouTube</a> (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/valve-boss-gabe-newell-made-a-usd9-5-billion-net-worth-off-everything-from-steam-to-half-life-and-portal-but-he-says-his-success-all-comes-down-to-luck-and-great-people/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>), Newell said it comes down to "luck" and "being surrounded by really great people."</p><p>Newell is <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported to own a fleet of yachts</a>, and he is known to work from one of his ships,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/" data-ref-id="1100-6533251"> taking breaks from time to time to go scuba diving.</a> While Newell may be a billionaire, he said he is not one to "study the subject of billionaires and so on."</p><p>As for specific people that Newell credits with helping him along the way, he called out Neil Konzen, Doug Klunder, and Jeff Harbers, all of whom he worked with in the early days of Microsoft. Newell and Konzen worked on early versions of Microsoft Windows, while Klunder created Microsoft Excel. Harbers, meanwhile, developed early versions of Microsoft Office--he <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jul-01-me-passings1.2.2-story.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">died in a plane crash in 2006.</a></p><p>Newell said he was "lucky enough to be around people like them" at Microsoft. He added that his luck continued when he left Microsoft to start Valve in 1996. Of course, Valve would go on to become a gigantic success with games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Left 4 Dead, and the massively popular platform Steam. Through it all, Valve has remained privately owned, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sought-to-buy-valve-for-1-billion-report/1100-6394880/" data-ref-id="1100-6394880">despite companies trying to buy it.</a></p><p>"I think that's how I've ended up where I am. I mean, it'd be great to say I'm just this absolutely f**king wonderful person and I earned all of this and this expresses my awesomeness, but there was an awful lot of luck that went into it," he said.</p><p>One of Valve's next upcoming games is Deadlock, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/">multiplayer game that's early in development</a>.</p>
