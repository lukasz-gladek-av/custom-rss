                <p>Polish developer CD Projekt Red has numerous projects in development currently, and one of them is an entirely new IP. The game is in development under the codename Project Hadar. While it's still early days for this game, and not much is known, there are some key details that have been revealed so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Project_Hadar_be_released_">When will Project Hadar be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Project_Hadar">Preorder Project Hadar</a></li><li><a href="#Project_Hadar_new_IP_trailer_information">Project Hadar new IP trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Project_Hadar_new_IP_platforms">Project Hadar new IP platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Project_Hadar_new_IP_story__setting__and_characters">Project Hadar new IP story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Project_Hadar_game_engine">Project Hadar game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Project_Hadar_">Who's developing Project Hadar?</a></li><li><a href="#Project_Hadar_development_news">Project Hadar development news</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433508-screenshot2025-01-24at2.04.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433508" data-ratio="0.56129807692308" data-width="832" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433508-screenshot2025-01-24at2.04.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433508"></a><figcaption>Hadar is a new IP from CD Projekt.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433508-screenshot2025-01-24at2.04.34pm.png"></figure><h2 id="When_will_Project_Hadar_be_released_">When will Project Hadar be released?</h2><p>CD Projekt Red has only confirmed the existence of a new IP and has not shared when it could be released, or even a projection of when the studio wants to launch the game.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Project_Hadar">Preorder Project Hadar</h2><p>Preorders for CD Projekt Red's new IP are not available yet, which makes sense given the game hasn't even been announced or assigned a release date.</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_new_IP_trailer_information">Project Hadar new IP trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, CD Projekt has not released any official trailers for its new IP.</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_new_IP_platforms">Project Hadar new IP platforms</h2><p>CD Projekt has not announced any platforms for its new IP, but given the developer's history, it can be safely assumed the game will come to PC and console.</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_new_IP_story__setting__and_characters">Project Hadar new IP story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Since Project Hadar has not been announced officially, there isn't much to go on at this stage. However, the developers have confirmed what the game is not, and that is a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan." Executive Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said previously on social media</a>, "It's definitely NOT a cosmic horror in feudal Japan."</p><p>Given that Project Hadar is a new IP, it stands to reason it will take place in a new, original universe featuring brand-new characters. The word "Hadar" has <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hadar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many definitions</a>, including a fossil site in Ethiopia and a star in the Centaurus constellation, but there is no telling if however the word may be defined is in any way associated with what the product might be when it's done.</p><p>CD Projekt developer Maria Mazu told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that they were "so happy" to learn they would get to make a new IP. "I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said. "It feels like a waste not to invest all that into something new or something that comes straight from us. I am very excited about Hadar."</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_game_engine">Project Hadar game engine</h2><p>Project Hadar is likely to be developed with Epic's Unreal Engine, though this is not confirmed. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4</a>, and it would make sense for the deal to cover CD Projekt's other games. But again, this is not confirmed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Project_Hadar_">Who's developing Project Hadar?</h2><p>CD Projekt is developing Project Hadar. As of October 31, 2024--which is when the latest data was published--CD Projekt said it had 18 people working on Project Hadar. This was actually down from 20 people at the end of July 2024. As you can see in the chart below, the overwhelming majority of CD Projekt's developers are working on Polaris, which is the codename for The Witcher 4.</p><p>CD Projekt has evolved in recent years to become a bigger studio that is making multiple games simultaneously. In addition to Hadar and The Witcher 4, CD Projekt's teams are working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-witcher-game-project-sirius-is-undergoing-some-changes/1100-6512512/" data-ref-id="1100-6512512">Witcher spin-off called Sirius. </a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498" data-ratio="0.56085918854415" data-width="838" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498"></a><figcaption>Only a small number of CD Projekt developers are working on Hadar right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Project_Hadar_development_news">Project Hadar development news</h2><p>CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1577317922460024834" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced Project Hadar in October 2022.</a> At the time, the studio said the game was "created from scratch" and was, at the time, in the "earliest stages of the creative process." At the time, the studio made it clear that it was not developing an actual game yet, but instead putting together the "foundation" for a game.</p><p>No one should expect Project Hadar to be released anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is the studio's current main focus, and it just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">entered full production at the end of 2024.</a></p><p>CD Projekt making a new IP is a major development for the studio, as the company is best known for its adaptations of other creator's works. The Witcher is based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, while Cyberpunk 2077 is based on Mike Pondsmith's role-playing game.</p>

The Tomb features a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon, which deals elemental damage and provides an additional way to heal downed teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the Citadelle des Morts final cutscene, Gabriel Krafft tells the crew to take the amulet they've acquired to an excavation site in France. As seen in the trailer below, the crew finds itself at the dig site, which features underground tombs and a subterranean temple.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvFuhlYRMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlvFuhlYRMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay for The Tomb shows off all these various layers of the map, and it gives us an even better look at the map's Wonder Weapon in action. The Tomb features the Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon, which is familiar to those who played the popular Origins map from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Staff of Ice is capable of firing icy blasts at enemies, slowing or freezing them in place, as well as dealing a more devastating area-of-effect attack. It also has the ability to heal, and the trailer shows a crew member using the Wonder Weapon to fire a restorative blast to revive a downed teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Origins is one of the most beloved Zombies maps of all time, and while this is only one of the four elemental staffs featured in the original Black Ops 2 map, it's really nice to see the staff return after all these years. Plus, having another way to heal teammates is always a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also adds the Death Perception perk from Black Ops 4, and augments will be available to unlock to upgrade the perk. Three more Gobblegums are introduced, including one Whimsical Gobblegum that dresses all the zombies with rubber ducky flotation devices.</p><p dir="ltr">All the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-roadmap-details-terminator-event-new-mp-maps-and-warzone-improvements/2900-6155/#1">highlights of Season 2's content can be found here</a>, which includes brand-new multiplayer maps, a Terminator crossover event, and ninja-themed operators.</p>
