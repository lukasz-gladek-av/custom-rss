                <p>Grammy-winning artist Sabrina Carpenter is on her way to Fortnite with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">skins, music packs, and more</a>. Officially announced in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Fortnite website, the artist will headline Fortnite Festival Season 8 as this season's Icon, beginning on April 8.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Festival is sort of like a Rock Band-like game mode that lives within Fortnite and lets up to four players perform together online. Carpenter is the latest of Festival Icons joining Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Metallica</a>.</p><p>"I've always found it exciting for fans to be able to interact and engage with music through different art forms and to interact in a way that’s genuinely fun," Carpenter told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/sabrina-carpenter-fortnite-headliner-1235311131/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> in a statement. "So, for the fans that haven't been able to come to the tour, or to any new fans, this is such a special way to still be a part of Short n' Sweet world."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959"></a><figcaption>Give your game a shot of Espresso with these looks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>By unlocking the Season Eight Music Pass, players can access a ton of new Carpenter-inspired content, including new Jam Tracks "Juno" and "Nonsense," which are fully playable as performances with others in Festival. Of course, the biggest selling point is the ability to play as Sabrina herself, who comes with two skins (each with two color variations) based on outfits from her recent Short n’ Sweet tour.</p><p>To purchase the music pass, Fortnite players need 1,400 V-Bucks (roughly $13). After that, players will immediately unlock the yellow babydoll Sabrina Carpenter Outfit--with an included Lego Style. The outfit resembles the one she wore on her most recent tour. At the end of the pass, players will receive a similar bodysuit, another look from her tour.</p><p>One of the bigger changes coming this season will be the renaming of Fortnite emotes; all of those that include dancing will now be aptly called dance emotes in the Locker. While using a dance emote, any player can do the same dance with you--even if they don't own the emote. There will be two Sabrina-inspired dance emotes this season: the Taste Emote and the Please Please Please Emote, which are each choreographed to the song they're tied to.</p><p>As the season progresses, players can unlock more Sabrina goodies like a skirt and boots inspired by another tour look. This has a pink default Style, a Baby Blue alt Style, and another Lego version. There will also be a matching lipstick-stained purse with both pink and blue stylings. Lastly, customizations like her own Battle Bus contrail and microphone.</p><p>Since launching in late 2023, Fortnite Festival has been bringing in a new headlining artist every three months or so. The current season is headlined by virtual pop star <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku</a>. </p>

                <p>Nintendo confirmed to GameSpot that it is actively in discussion with developers whose Nintendo Switch games have compatibility issues on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Shortly after last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, a webpage emerged outlining all of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOoo_ZVigsmweA5nha09wz_OJkAt0gSkOMUUwBmKy0Fj0iOyST8W0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch games with compatibility issues</a> on the Switch 2. Although the majority of the original Switch's library is compatible with the new piece of Nintendo hardware, some titles have in-game compatibility issues while others have problems just starting up in the first place. These problems aren't just popping up for obscure indies either.</p><p>Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/another-crabs-treasure/" data-ref-id="5000-564470">Another Crab's Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> are having problems with start-up, while titles such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harvestella/" data-ref-id="5000-566601">Harvestella</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overcooked-all-you-can-eat/" data-ref-id="5000-516001">Overcooked: All You Can Eat</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stumble-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-535994">Stumble Guys</a> have in-game compatibility issues. In an interview with Nintendo's Technology Development Division General Manager Tetsuya Sasaki, GameSpot asked if Nintendo was in discussions with and offering insights to the developers behind these Switch games with Switch 2 compatibility issues.</p><p>"Yes, Nintendo has worked very hard at figuring out how to make a wide variety of games compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2," Sasaki explained. "And as the Nintendo Switch 2 became more and more complete and entered its final form, we really realized how important it is for us to work very closely together with our third-party partners. And that is how this list came about."</p><p>While some third-party developers are disappointed that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/" data-ref-id="1100-6530621">haven't received development kits</a> for Switch 2 yet, Sasaki's comments show that Nintendo wants to work closely with its third-party partners to ensure games run well on its latest hardware.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5.

                <p>Nintendo's full unveiling of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> finally answered the mystery of what the new C button was for: a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">new GameChat function</a>, which will let you easily talk with friends, share your screen in group sessions, or even show your face if you purchase a camera peripheral. But the GameChat shown during the debut stream was less than stellar, with a noticeably choppy framerate. Nintendo told GameSpot in an interview that it intentionally made GameChat the smallest footprint possible, to save system resources for the games themselves.</p><p>"In order to explain this well, I think it might first help to explain about the resources the system has," Switch 2 hardware director Takuhiro Dohta said, via a translator. "So obviously, chat is meant to run and work simultaneously and coincide with the game you're playing. But we also think it's critical that it doesn't get in the way of the game that's running right now. And so we wanted to definitely make sure we do was to make sure that running game chat alongside the game doesn't result in the game experience or quality being reduced at all in any way.</p><p>"So from a system resource perspective, obviously even the Nintendo Switch had a set of system resources that it needed to tap into to run the system. And now that we have Nintendo Switch 2, there is bigger, more, basically resource budget to use. However, even with that enhanced and larger budget, we try to use as little of that as possible. And they made it happen somehow. And within that small slice of the resource budget, there's other things to take into consideration, like network systems, all that kind of stuff, and all of that taking into account is where we landed in terms of quality of the video that you saw in the footage."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Technical director Tetsuya Sasaki added that Nintendo puts a priority on making sure experiences are kept consistent between players, which led to the decision to keep the GameChat footprint small.</p><p>"As Nintendo, one thing we really put emphasis on is making sure that everyone experiences a very even experience when it comes to the quality of service that they're experiencing," Sasaki said. "And based on this emphasis that we prioritize--obviously if somebody is in a better environment, they're going to get better results in terms of their experience--but we really wanted to make sure that more than anything people had an equal or even playing field, or even experience, rather. And I think that was our priority as an entertainment company.</p><p>"And the other aspect of this is that we want to make sure that there is enough power reserved for the games themselves. And so we have a smaller area to play around in within to make sure that all these varying aspects to fit into, things like network environment connectivity. And so we landed on within this margin that we have to work within, this is a good even experience that we can provide."</p><p>Sasaki said that this consideration was especially important going forward, as games will continue to get increasingly complex and system intensive on Switch 2.</p><p>"Another important thing is that with the Nintendo Switch 2 we're going to see more and more titles come out," he said. "And again, we really want to make sure that reservation of space is going to them. And so that's another factor here for us."</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming on June 5. Preorders had been expected to begin this week, with the system priced at $450 for the base model and $500 for a bundle that includes a digital copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>. However, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed the preorder date</a> in light of tariffs from President Trump, saying it needs to take time to evaluate the "potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." That suggests the price may be under review, and we could see it increase.</p><p>We're also getting more details from Nintendo developers due to interviews conducted at the reveal event. Among other things we've learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-games-could-get-performance-boost-without-paid-switch-2-upgrades/1100-6530656/" data-ref-id="1100-6530656">Switch 1 games could get a boost on Switch 2</a> even without paid upgrades, that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">game key-carts won't be tied</a> to your Switch Online account, and in case you were curious, yes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649">Switch 2 carts still taste terrible</a>.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">hands-on with the Switch 2</a> and found it doesn't pack many surprises, but it does feel like a worthwhile upgrade to the original Switch. The debut event also had several upcoming games to try out, including the aforementioned Mario Kart World and the wildly destructive Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On: Facing 18 Years Of Expectations</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li></ul>

                <p>The long-rumored remake of Bethesda's popular 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion continues to come into focus. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb offered an update on the project today during GameBreaking News, saying he expects the game to release soon.</p><p>In fact, Grubb said he expects Bethesda to shadowdrop the game "at any moment this month." That means Bethesda would announce and release the game at or around the same time, it appears.</p><p>This tracks with previous rumors and reports that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rumored-oblivion-remake-could-launch-sooner-than-expected/1100-6530081/" data-ref-id="1100-6530081">Bethesda might announce and release the game close together</a>, at some point in April.

Now through April 22, ESO players can earn a variety of rewards and buffs as part of the celebration.</p><p>It's been reported that Virtuous developed the apparent Oblivion remake, and that it was "fully remade" with Unreal Engine 5 and featuring a variety of re-worked gameplay systems. Some thought Microsoft and Bethesda would reveal an Oblivion remake during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct in January, but that did not happen.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411" data-ratio="0.60619872379216" data-width="1097" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411"></a><figcaption>Is an Oblivion remake/remaster in the works?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg"></figure><p>The rumor dates back to documents from the Microsoft vs. FTC case in 2023 concerning the Xbox company's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. "Oblivion Remaster" was listed as an upcoming unannounced Bethesda game for release in financial year 2022. Obviously, that did not happen.</p><p>There is no word on potential platforms for the rumored Oblivion remake. While Bethesda is releasing some of its games on rival platforms, like this May's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, Bethesda's biggest game in recent times, Starfield, is still exclusive to Xbox and PC.</p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>While an official remake of Oblivion has yet to be announced,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672"> there is a fan-made Oblivion remake, Skyblivion, coming in 2025.</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

Since the card will act as an authentication device, that has left potential Switch 2 buyers concerned about the resale value of their game. Fortunately, it looks like Game-Key cards won't be tied to your Nintendo account, as it has been revealed that regardless of the Switch 2 unit that they're inserted into, the user will be able to play the game tied to them.</p><p>"So key cards will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it's not tied to an account or anything," Nintendo's Tetsuya Sasaki explained to GameSpot.</p><p>It's not clear yet why certain games will use the Game-Key format, but the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo customer support page</a> did confirm that a Game-Key Card is required to remain inserted in the Switch 2 after that game has been downloaded and installed. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2. Game-Key cards will also be marked by a white banner at the bottom of Switch 2 game cases, to differentiate them from Switch 2 cards that contain the full game on them.</p><div tabindex="0"
