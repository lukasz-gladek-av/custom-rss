                <p>As part of Apple's big September event today, the company did what it usually does in September: announced a new iPhone. In fact, Apple unveiled four new iPhone models, including the "impossibly thin" iPhone Air and the more powerful iPhone 17 Pro. The others include the iPhone 17 Pro Max and a new base-model iPhone 17. All of them are launching later this month.</p><h2>iPhone Air</h2><p>At 5.6mm, it's the thinnest iPhone that Apple has ever made. It features a 6.5" screen and is said to be durable thanks in part to being made with titanium (80% of which comes from recycled sources).</p><p>The iPhone Air comes in black, white, gold, and blue. It runs on the A19 Pro processor, which sets new stands for mobile phones, Apple said. The GPU, meanwhile, gets improved with a 5-core setup and baked-in AI acceleration features. Users can expect "Macbook Pro levels of compute," Apple said.</p><p>The camera takes 48 megapixel photos with one lens and an 18mp front-facing camera that includes a "center stage" feature that uses AI to find the best angles. A new feature, dual capture video, allows you to record yourself with the front-facing camera while recording with the back camera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580" data-ratio="0.56631171345595" data-width="2066" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580"></a><figcaption>The iPhone Air.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Apple said the internal design has been "completely redesigned" to maximum space for the battery itself. Apple promises "all-day battery life" for the iPhone Air. There is also a MagSafe battery accessory that people can buy to extend battery life.</p><h2>iPhone 17 Pro</h2><p>The iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery in any iPhone, a new camera system with "breathtaking range and resolution," and the most powerful chip Apple has ever made for an iPhone. It's designed to be extremely durable, Apple said, with new protections for the front and the back. It also has a better battery that can support up to 39 hours of video playback on a single charge. Take a look for yourself:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586"></a><figcaption>The iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of the new cameras, they include the "best camera system we've ever made," Apple said, and they include the 18mp "center stage" camera on the front and three rear cameras--all are 48 megapixels. The "extended plateau" for the camera allows for the longest optical zoom Apple has ever made.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 17 base model</strong></h2><p>The new line of iPhone 17 base-model phones will run on a new processor called A19, which is "faster and more efficient," Apple said. The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3" display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming. NetEase's Destiny: Rising will be among the games to support the 120Hz feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576" data-ratio="0.58842443729904" data-width="1866" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576"></a><figcaption>The four new iPhones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png"></figure><p>A big part of having a phone is taking photos of your dog with it, and the new iPhone 17 will feature a better camera that should take more impressive photos than before, Apple said. There is a new "center stage" camera, too, to help people take better selfies, videos, and more. You also no longer need to rotate your phone to take a selfie, and the camera uses AI to automatically select the best angles.</p><p>Below you can see a rundown of the iPhone 17 base model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578" data-ratio="0.58230256898192" data-width="2102" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578"></a><figcaption>A quick look at the special features of the iPhone 17.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png"></figure>

                <p>The ambitious mod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">Skyblivion is still aiming to release in 2025</a>, according to the mod's developers, even as one former developer on the project called it quits after nine years, claiming it's "less of a passion project and more of a crunch project."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, which has been in development for 13 years, looks to recreate Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion in the more modern engine of its sequel, Skyrim. However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p>

                <p>Pablo Sanchez fans, rejoice. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">reviving the Backyard Sports name</a> and releasing three games in the quirky and cartoony series, publisher Playground Productions has launched Backyard Football '99 on Steam and mobile platforms. As with the original release, the football game stars a colorful cast of child athletes, along with younger versions of actual NFL legends.</p><p>Real-life players Barry Sanders, Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe, Jerry Rice, John Elway, Randall Cunningham, and Steve Young are once again in the Backyard Football roster, though this modern remaster notably lacks Brett Favre. Developer Mega Cat Studios ended up replacing Favre with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2J9qBR1erE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original character Chase Downfield</a>, which marks the first time these remasters have introduced a new kid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWQf22CCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVqWQf22CCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While most of the kiddified professional football players are back, the game lacks any imagery or references to the NFL. The original 1999 release of Backyard Football let players use actual NFL team names, logos, and colors. Instead, players can form teams like the Labrador Receivers, the Dirty Socks, or the Ticklish Tornados. Interestingly, Backyard Baseball '01, which was released on Steam in July, includes MLB teams and references.</p><p>But despite being bereft of Brett Favre and any NFL iconography, Backyard Football '99 should still prove to be a familiar and nostalgic romp for those who played the original game on CD-ROM thanks to its faithful visuals and audio.</p><p>"Backyard Football ‘99 made me a football fan for life. From learning plays to managing teams, this game made football accessible, fun, and exciting for all ages," said CEO of Playground Productions Lindsay Barnett in a press release marking the remaster's release. "I am so proud to bring it back in time for football season."</p><p>Next up for Playground Productions and Backyard Sports are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">re-releases of Backyard Basketball '01</a> and Backyard Hockey '02, though there are no announced release dates for either title yet.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
