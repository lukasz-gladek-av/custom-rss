                <p>Smite 2 Developer Hi-Rez has apparently laid off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eazBFw1skA4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-60 employees</a> and stopped development on three games: Rogue Company, Paladins, and Smite 1.</p><p>Several now-former employees of Hi-Rez took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media saying that they had been laid off</a>, and the layoffs look like they impact a variety of departments from designers, QA, marketing, and social media.</p><p>A Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Hocky2001/status/1887567843576660451" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> presumably from Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam that stated that the reduction impacted the Rally Here, Evil Mojo, and Titan Forge Games divisions. Additionally, Rogue Company, Paladins, and Smite 1 will no longer receive major updates, but the servers will remain up for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Smite 2 is currently in early access, and looks to be Hi-Rez's sole focus going forward. The aforementioned message also stated that the reductions are meant to enable a steady flow of new content for Smite 2.</p><p>Hi-Rez already went through a round of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brutal-game-layoffs-continue-with-smite-developer-hi-rez/1100-6526876/" data-ref-id="1100-6526876">layoffs back in October</a>. However, it's not the first developer to conduct layoffs this week. Others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumbleverse-developer-iron-galaxy-lays-off-more-than-60-people-trying-to-avoid-shutdown/1100-6529272/" data-ref-id="1100-6529272">Iron Galaxy</a> and 31st Union, and the latter's parent company 2K reportedly fired its studio head <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">due to the lackluster response around Project Ethos</a>.</p>
