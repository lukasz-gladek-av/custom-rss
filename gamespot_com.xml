                <p>If you want to hook up with your friends in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/">Roblox</a>, you no longer need to use third-party software such as Discord. This is because the Roblox Corporation released a dedicated Party feature that allows you and your friends to join the same experience, even if you play on different devices.</p><p>Hosting a Roblox Party is relatively straightforward, and joining one is even simpler. Right now, there are a few restrictions on who can use the feature in an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/" data-ref-id="1100-6533600">keep Roblox safe</a> for all players. There are also benefits to joining a Party within some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">best Roblox games</a> too, so below we’ll go over everything you need to know to keep the fun entertaining, while also keeping you safe.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_start_or_join_a_Roblox_Party">How to start or join a Roblox Party</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_keep_your_Roblox_Party_safe_">How to keep your Roblox Party safe </a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_disable_Party_Chat">How to disable Party Chat</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Roblox_games_to_play_with_friends_">Best Roblox games to play with friends </a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560082-roblox-party-features-chat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560082" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560082-roblox-party-features-chat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560082"></a><figcaption>Eventually, you'll be able to chat with your voice along with your close friends. For now, it's just text chat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560082-roblox-party-features-chat.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_start_or_join_a_Roblox_Party">How to start or join a Roblox Party</h2><p>To start a party, open Roblox on either the PC or mobile app, and go to the Party tab. From there, you can click the plus sign to add users in your friends list to your group. Once you’ve finalized adding the people you want to invite, click or tap the Join button to send the invitation. After everyone arrives, you have the option to pick an experience for you all to play and send invites for them within the Party screen to join your game. Even when you’re offline, the party will still be available for the next time you play.</p><p>If you want to add a user to a party you’ve already created, go to the group you wish to edit and click the three dots on the top right of your screen. You can then select “Add Connections” and search for the player’s username, finally clicking “Add” to include them in the group.</p><p>Those who are waiting to join a party should first ensure that they’re on the host’s friends list. If so, you’ll receive a notification either through the app or via mobile push notifications. You can also open the Party tab to see any active parties. Tap on the host’s party or notification and click “Join” to get into the group.</p><p>There are a few limitations for you to keep in mind. The first is that only players over the age of 13, or a parent or caregiver, can create a party. Those using parental controls can restrict party access entirely or limit it to one-on-one access only, such as you playing a game with your child or having one friend join them at a time. If you are over 13, you can also only chat via text, but voice chat is coming soon. Finally, the maximum party size is six players, including the host.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083"></a><figcaption>As the host, you'll have control over the games you play with your friends, as well as the ability to moderate the party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_keep_your_Roblox_Party_safe_"><span>How to keep your Roblox Party safe</span></h2><p>As the host of the party, you should absolutely be able to trust the players you game with. Should anyone need a time out, you can navigate to the group they are in, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, then the three dots next to the user in question. You can then “Report” or “Remove from group,” depending on how serious it is. Remember that if the user breached the Roblox Community Standards and Terms of Use, you can report the user first, then remove them to ensure that Roblox moderators are aware of the infractions.</p><p>If anyone breaches that trust, either by scamming your friends or other questionable behavior, then it may be time to cut ties with them. Unfriending someone isn’t a nice thing to have to do, but it’s at least a simple process if you need to do it. If they’re an active user, go to the player’s profile on the Roblox website or app, then click the “Remove Connection” button. If you are following that player, you can also click the three-dot menu on the user’s page and select “Unfollow”.</p><p>Suppose the user is banned, temporarily or permanently? In that case, you can find their profile by navigating to the Following or Followers tab on your <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/following" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Connections page</a>, which we’ve provided a link to here for your convenience. From here, you can find the user whose profile box will be deactivated if banned. You can then click the three dots and then “Unfollow” as before.</p><p>If all of the members of the Party someone else created are making you feel uncomfortable, you can leave the group. Use the Party tab on the PC app, find the group you want to leave, then click the three dots on the top right, and select “Leave Group”. This is under the Connections tab on mobile devices.</p><h3 id="How_to_disable_Party_Chat">How to disable Party Chat</h3><p>Users aged 13 and over can disable Party Chat by checking the Connections page and changing the settings from the default settings to “No one”. You can also limit the number of Connections to a one-on-one party if you so wish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560086"></a><figcaption>One of the many experiences you can play with friends is Tower of Hell, as you can see who can get up the course the highest as quickly as possible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560086-roblox-party-features-games.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Best_Roblox_games_to_play_with_friends_"><span>Best Roblox games to play with friends</span></h2><p>While many of the experiences could work with friends, some are designed with multiplayer as the main focus. Some of the best ones include party games such as Natural Disaster Survival and Epic Minigames, which do their best to invoke the chaotic fun of minigame-focused retail games, like the Mario Party series.</p><p>Other popular games with multiplayer modes include Theme Park Tycoon 2, in which you and your friends can help each other build the best rides and rollercoasters, as well as competitive PVP games like Blox Fruits. Finally, if you’re a little older, Doors is a particularly decent match for friendship groups. As you traipse through the hallways with your buddies watching your back, monsters will spring out of nowhere to scare you and everyone nearby senseless.</p>

                <p>It's a big week for gaming with events like the Tokyo Game Show, but right now, it's time for Sony to show what it has been cooking up with a new State of Play broadcast today, September 24. We've rounded up all the details for the livestream, popped in a few links for where to watch, when it starts, and what you can expect from it. On September 25, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-announced-for-september-25/1100-6534572/" data-ref-id="1100-6534572">you can also tune in for an Xbox livestream</a>, which will be held at a <em>very </em>early time.</p><h2>How to watch the State of Play</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enWyMpM0k4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>State of Play will be streamed live on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> channels and will be broadcast in English.</p><h2>State of Play start time</h2><p>The State of Play broadcast begins today, September 24, at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET and will run for approximately 35 minutes.</p><ul><li>2 PM PT</li><li>5 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CEST</li><li>6 AM JST (September 25)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Sony says that the event will feature reveals and news from developers around the world on third-party games and indie titles. On the first-party side, Sony has confirmed that there'll be an extended look at Housemarque's next game, Saros, with five minutes of PS5-captured gameplay. You can also look forward to updates from some of the teams at PlayStation Studios, but beyond that, Sony is keeping quiet on the specific details here.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2, so we're expecting to see a quick trailer for the game, and this would be a great time to reveal a few new characters for the upcoming superhero brawler from Arc System Works, Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Fans are also eager to see a fresh look at Insomniac's Wolverine game, which was first announced way back in 2021. It has also been a year since Uncharted developer Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, so an update on that game wouldn't be unwelcome.</p><p>If we're digging into rumored reveals, then there might be some pleasant surprises today. Speculation about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">new God of War game</a> that will be smaller in scope and will see players return to ancient Greece has been doing the rounds for a while now, and everything from a Metal Gear Solid 4 port to a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> have also been heavily rumored for a while now. The only way to find out will be to tune in today to see what the future of PlayStation looks like.</p>

                <p>On the RGG Summit livestream tonight, Sega announced , a ground-up remake of 2009's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-3/" data-ref-id="5000-37569">Yakuza 3</a>. As with the previous "Kiwami" remakes, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2, Kiwami 3 gives the game's visuals a massive upgrade, fleshes out story details with new cutscenes and action sequences, and also is set to offer a wealth of new side content.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA5Lec9jYuQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GA5Lec9jYuQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5_-kp17jCw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RGG Direct</a>, game director Ryosuke Horii elaborated on some of the game's additions. Besides additional story scenes, several of the cutscenes and voicelines from Yakuza 3 have been completely redone for Kiwami 3. The environments of Okinawa--a distinct feature of Yakuza 3--have also been completely remade. Combat sees similar revamps, with Kiryu being able to switch between his classic "Dragon of Dojima Kiwami" fighting skills and the all-new, Okinawan-martial-arts-inspired, weapon-heavy "Ryukyu Style." And to top it all off, the "Dragon Boost" powered-up mode gives Kiryu's hard-hitting, face-smashing, ruffian-hurling techniques even more of a ferocious edge.</p><p>All-new minigames were also showcased. A new game mode called "Life at Morning Glory" shows the softer side of Kiryu as he manages the Morning Glory orphanage and interacts with the children under his care. Another new mini-game, "Legendary Baddie: Bad Boy Dragon," sees Kiryu teaming up with a posse of female Okinawan biker gang members and helping them in their turf wars against rival groups.</p><p>Additionally, the game will feature a brand-new "Gaiden" story taking place just before the in-game events of Kiwami 3. This story, called Dark Ties, will focus on Yoshitaka Mine, Yakuza 3's primary antagonist. Mine will be a fully playable character in this story, allowing players to get a deeper look into the life and motivation of one of Yakuza 3's most endearing characters. This story will be part of the core Kiwami 3 package, and you will be able to choose whether to play the main story of Dark Ties upon starting the game.</p><p>Gameplay in Dark Ties is similar to that of Yakuza 3, and it focuses primarily on the familiar ground of Kamurocho. He fights with a mix of boxing-style techniques and acrobatic aerial strikes, and also has a powered-up "Dark Awakening" state he can enter into for increased brutality. The Dark Ties campaign features numerous mini-games and sub-stories, including "Kanda Damage Control"--where you attempt to launder the reputation of the notoriously noxious gangster Tsuyoshi Kanda, and the "Hell's Arena" underground coliseum.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvAQW8ObqM4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvAQW8ObqM4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Digital edition pre-orders <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have gone live on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/JP0177-PPSA30223_00-MAINGAME00000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Network</a>, where the game is listed as having a February 11, 2026 release date and a $59.99 price tag for the standard edition.
