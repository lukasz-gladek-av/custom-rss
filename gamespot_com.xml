                <p>The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.</p><p>According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.</p><p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said</a> some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.</p><p>The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. </p><p>"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back," center Tyler Linderbaum said. "We have 11 games left to try to run the table."</p><p>The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. </p>
