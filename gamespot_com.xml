                <p dir="ltr">Nightdive Studios has announced that the System Shock remake will launch December 18 on Switch and Switch 2. The developer revealed that a critical decision regarding Unreal Engine made the ports possible, especially with the original Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">In a dev diary video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwdpC__mTw">on YouTube</a> (seen below), Nightdive explains that the team first planned on utilizing Unreal Engine 5 for the remake of System Shock on Switch 2. But then Nightdive wondered about bringing the classic immersive to both Nintendo hybrid consoles and found out Unreal Engine 4 was a possibility. "Once we made that discovery, we did that big pivot for a few reasons--the biggest was stability," said developer Thomas Curnow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwdpC__mTw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKwdpC__mTw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Within 48 hours, Nightdive felt vindicated by the choice with Unreal Engine 4, according to the video. That's because successful builds of the remake were created for Switch and Switch 2 in that timeframe. "I want the game to be just as we remember it," said producer Justin Khan.</p><p dir="ltr">The System Shock remake first launched on PC in 2023 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-remake-is-out-in-may-for-consoles/1100-6521791/">arriving on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> in May 2024. The efforts from Nightdive to resurrect the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-system-shock-2023/1100-6514652/">were generally well received</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-remaster-is-finally-out-on-consoles-next-week/1100-6532869/">Nightdive released a remaster of System Shock 2</a> on PC and consoles, including Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-has-entered-an-agreement-to-acquire-nightdive-studios/1100-6512622/">Nightdive is a part of Atari</a>, after being acquired in 2023.</p>
