                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is celebrating its 25th anniversary next month, but EA kicked off the festivities early via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">new episode of Behind The Sims</a>, giving players a peek at what the future holds for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>, including base game updates, free in-game content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-three-new-sims-4-content-kits-including-one-made-with-lilsimsies-help/1100-6528807/">a trio of new Kits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest episode, which aired live on The Sims' YouTube channel, provided a look at the game's upcoming content roadmap and hinted at some other surprises, including a 25-hour livestream that will feature a "special guest [who players] might know."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Per EA, The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration schedule is as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 14:</strong> The Sims 4 main menu UI overhaul</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 16:</strong> Three new Kits launch, including the Secret Sanctuary Kit, the Casanova Cave Kit, and the Comfy Gamer Kit, the latter of which was created in collaboration with popular Sims 4 YouTuber LilSimsie.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 27 - 31:</strong> Nostalgia Now Event (No details have been shared regarding this event, though it could be a login event that rewards players with exclusive in-game items.)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 4:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">A 25-hour livestream featuring the aforementioned mysterious special guest will take place.</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 Blast From The Past Event begins, featuring free rewards "inspired by iconic items from the 2000s, like a milk carton, telephone, alarm clock, triple-tiered birthday cake, and inflatable chair and loveseat."</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 will receive new (free) base game content featuring over 70 new in-game items including hairstyle, basic clothing, new swatches, and more.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 6:</strong> Motherload Season begins. EA hasn't yet shared details regarding what exactly this event will consist of, but given the fact that it's named after the in-game cheat used to fill a Sim's bank account with cash, it's probably safe to say this season will be all about those sweet, sweet Simoleons.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 25:</strong> ???</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397"></a><figcaption>The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration is packed to the brim with content celebrating the series' history--and its future.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg"></figure><p>Whatever EA has planned for February 25, The Sims 4 devs are keeping their lips zipped for now, with an emoji of two large eyeballs in place of the event's description. But it's possible that February 25 will see the announcement of the game's next expansion packs, as EA has historically used large Sims-based events to promote upcoming DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">The livestream also revealed that The Sims 25th Anniversary event will include a free update that gives the game's generally underwhelming townie homes a much-needed makeover, with pools and other features that weren't available when those houses were first created. It's unclear if the digital dollhouse redecoration will take place as part of the free update on February 4, or if it will launch later in the month.</p><p>For more information on all the new content coming to The Sims 4, The Sims FreePlay, and MySims: Cozy Bundle--plus details on The Sims 25th Anniversary merch--check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" rel="nofollow ">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>

having attacks automatically hit. According to a datamine by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-datamined-plunderstorm-abilities-349674" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, it seems there will be some new abilities for players to experiment with this time around, with two new offensive and utility abilities. On the offensive side, there is Aura of Zealotry, which looks to mimic the iconic Paladin ability Consecration, while another, Celestial Barrage, calls down beams of moonlight to damage and reveal enemies. The new utility spells include Call Galefeather, which pushes enemies back, and the G.R.A.V. Glove: a spell that allows players to place a mark and then instantly teleport back to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, winning and completing matches saw players progress through a Plunderstorm Renown reward track (similar to a battle pass). The end result was one where players felt compelled to grind all the way to the end to earn the more lucrative cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">This time around, the experience should be less aggravating. Instead of progressing a battle-pass-like system, players simply earn Plunder that can be spent at new reward vendors. This lets players pick and choose which rewards they want to go after rather than having to grind through rewards they might not be interested in.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of rewards, there's a number of new items available for players who maxed out the Renown track the first time the event was playable. Those who fell off the grind the first time the event was live will find that many of the mode's old rewards have returned. There are two new pets, mounts, and titles to claim, as well a number of new weapon and armor cosmetics. There are also new achievements, all of which reward a number of pirate-themed titles like Swabbie, Swashbuckler, and Buccaneer based on how much Plunder players earn over the course of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW will see two major content updates this year according to the game's 2025 content roadmap, as well as a full reveal of the game's next expansion, Midnight. Blizzard already revealed that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">long-requested feature, player housing, will be part of Midnight</a>, but has not released additional details.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is reportedly set to announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on January 16, and Walmart Canada--known for upsetting video game developers by leaking announcements early--has chimed in with a meme of its own.</p><p>Today, January 14, the Walmart Canada Gaming account posted the popular image of Mario peeking from behind a curtain. "Hey, Mario," the post said, with the waving-hand emoji. Walmart Canada is no doubt referencing the rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">forthcoming Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p>What's noteworthy here is that Walmart Canada has a semi-lengthy history of spoiling major announcements by posting product pages ahead of official announcements. As of yet, however, Walmart Canada hasn't spoiled anything about the Switch 2.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/788900063833493504" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Mario curtain image dates back to 2016</a>, when Nintendo of America used it to promote the announcement of the Switch, which was then known as "NX." It was meant to suggest that Nintendo would soon pull back the curtain on the device. It quickly became a meme, and some thought it was kind of creepy. Former Nintendo staffers later discussed how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-former-staff-say-infamously-weird-mario-curtain-photo-wont-happen-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo was aware of the reaction</a> and would never do something like that again.</p><p>Walmart Canada's leaks have included the first reveal of Rage 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-vp-pete-hines-drags-walmart-canad/1100-6459642/" data-ref-id="1100-6459642">prompting Bethesda to drag the retailer in comments during E3 2018.</a> Also in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-reacts-to-rage-2-possibly-being-leaked-be/1100-6458836/" data-ref-id="1100-6458836">Walmart Canada leaked Borderlands 3, Gears 5, Just Cause 4, and other titles</a>.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming account is run by Riley Little. He <a href="https://www.walmartcanada.ca/news/2022/11/16/gamers-united-the-success-story-of-walmart-canada-gamings-twitter-account#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20Walmart%20was%20a%20person,more%20than%20three%20years%20ago." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a blog post in 2022</a> that it came down from above that Walmart Canada could do a better job communicating to gamers, and it was his idea to make the account "more approachable and more interesting." To achieve this, Little started posting all kinds of memes, as well as straight news and product announcements to drive people to shop at Walmart.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming leaks, though, have slowed down significantly in recent years. After all, video game developers and publishers generally do not enjoy having their unannounced information emerge early. As such, it would be shocking to see Walmart Canada actually reveal anything legitimate about the Switch 2, though you never know. Outside of Walmart Canada, the internet has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">full of Switch leaks</a>. </p><p>If the rumors prove to be accurate, Nintendo could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">announce the Switch 2 on Thursday, January 16</a>, with the console then going on sale in May or June.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is turning 25 this year, and EA has announced that a trio of new Kits are scheduled to hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> later this week to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The news was announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">a livestreamed</a> episode of Behind The Sims, which was posted to the official Sims YouTube channel. The stream featured a number of well-known "Simmers": players who stream their Sims 4 gameplay on Twitch or YouTube. In fact, one of the upcoming Kits was created in collaboration with LilSimsie, a popular Sims 4 content creator known for her elaborate house builds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the new Kits, all three of will be available for purchase on January 16, and although their price has yet to be confirmed, Sims 4 Kits normally cost $5 USD, so it's likely that players will be able to get their hands on all three of the new Kits for a total of $15. The Kits launching on January 16 are the Casanova Cave Kit, the Secret Sanctuary Kit, and the Cozy Gamer Kit. The Cozy Gamer Kit was created in collaboration with LilSimsie.</p><p dir="ltr">"Two of the Kits are a mixture of Build/Buy [Mode items] and Create-A-Sim items inspired by Sims icons," LilSimsie shared during the livestream. "And the last one? Well, that one was made in collaboration with me!"</p><p dir="ltr">Given LilSimsie's well-known love for creating extravagant lots in Build Mode, it's likely that the Kit she collaborated on will include a good number of new items for players to build and decorate in-game homes with.</p><p dir="ltr">But these mysterious new Kits aren't the only thing players have to look forward to: According to the schedule shared in the livestream, the game's main menu is getting a total UI revamp, which has already gone live. Additionally, EA has announced that the MySims: Cozy Bundle will come to PC on March 18 (currently, it's only available to play on Nintendo Switch). Lastly, The Sims FreePlay will get a new update on February 4 that pays homage to the era in which the game first launched back in 2000.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sims FreePlay has an exciting update planned!" EA shared. "Starting February 4, we're taking you back to the 2000s, where The Sims all began. Participate in special events, unlock velour tracksuits, and enjoy 25 days of in-game gifts featuring some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history!"</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on the new Sims 4 Kits, the MySims: Cozy Bundle, and The Sims FreePlay update, check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>
