                <p>It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">first device running an Arm chip</a>. But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary.</p><p>Valve's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">Steam Frame</a> headset is the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-steam-frame-will-support-android-games/1100-6536169/" data-ref-id="1100-6536169">first Arm-based device</a>, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared.

<p>"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts," Griffais explained. "We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since."</p><p>This is backed up by FEX's Ryan Houdek, who thanked Valve in a recent <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">anniversary post</a> for "being here from the start" on the seven-year project. "They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases."</p><p>While Valve has only just revealed its first Arm-based device, the company started thinking about developing for Arm as early as 2016. "We knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries," Griffais said.</p><p>As an open-source tool, FEX is already being used alongside other Valve-supported tech like Proton to power some of the leading PC emulators for Arm-based mobile devices--meaning Valve is quietly leading the push to bring Windows games to your phone without the need for a port. Whether the company has its own ambitions in the mobile space is yet to be seen, with Griffais saying Valve's current focus remains on "living room, handheld, and desktop."</p><p>Valve's support of emulation comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/" data-ref-id="1100-6536209">hard lessons learned</a> when its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine </a>flopped, partially due to its limited library. By investing in technology like Proton and FEX, Valve aims to save developers from having to put in time and resources on ports. "We would way rather have those game developers invest their time and energy into making their games better, or working on their next game," Griffais says. "We think that porting work is essentially wasted work when it comes to the value of the library."</p>

                <p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that the former alleges is a "slavish clone" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been "engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute." Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension.</p><p>The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.</p><p>At the heart of Sony's case is an accusation that Tencent intentionally tried to confuse players by passing Light of Motiram off as a Horizon-related game. Prior to the legal fireworks, Tencent apparently pitched Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">a Horizon game that was set in Asia</a>, which was ultimately turned down. Once the lawsuit was filed, Tencent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">pulled the Horizon-like imagery</a> from the game's Steam page. In court, Tencent claimed that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">get a monopoly on games similar to Horizon</a>.</p><p>Tencent also argued that it wasn't liable for any damages because any previous discussions about a Horizon game or even the development of Light of Motiram were done by subsidies owned or partially owned by Tencent. In response, Sony accused Tencent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accuses-tencent-of-playing-a-shell-game-to-avoid-liability-in-horizon-lawsuit/1100-6535487/" data-ref-id="1100-6535487">playing a legal shell game</a> to avoid the repercussions of infringing on its intellectual property.</p><p>As these legal maneuvers played out, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-steel-frontiers/" data-ref-id="5000-702414">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, which will be coming to mobile platforms and PC. However, it's rumored that Sony is planning its own Horizon MMORPG for PS5.</p>

                <p>Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December. Usually, the show is pretty sharp about not making major mistakes in the time period or anachronisms that shouldn't be there.

That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.</p><p>To demonstrate, this is what the NES port looks like:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P7CdqiHHPpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Nintendo was a good home console for its era, but it couldn't make the game look as good as it did in the arcade. This version also had better music and sound effects.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqMlLueMpew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dqMlLueMpew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to goofs, this isn't quite on the same level as <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-thrones-viewers-spot-starbucks-cup-episode-1207606/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the coffee cup that was left on set in Game of Thrones Season 8</a> or HBO Max's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/mad-men-hbo-max-4k-stream-roger-sterling-barf-tube-errors-1236439517/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent mix-up with Mad Men</a> which featured shots that included crew members who were supposed to be hidden. Netflix may not even bother to acknowledge or fix the Ghosts 'n Ghouls mix-up.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-and-dragons-stranger-things-welcome-to-the-hellfire-club/1100-6533505/" data-ref-id="1100-6533505">a Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Stranger Things TTRPG</a>.

As the name of the deal implies, this one is stacked with PC games that are perfect for playing on Steam Deck (though they'll also run great on desktops and laptops, of course). There are 23 games on offer, ranging from the Dark Souls-inspired roguelike Tyrant's Realm to AAA shooters like Wolfenstein: The New Order and its sequel, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Fans of lo-fi indie horror games will also want to check out Faith, whil anyone who misses bygone gaming eras will want to check out the retro-inspired RPG 8-Bit Adventures 2--which evokes console-style RPGs of the NES, SNES, and PS1--and the adventure-platformer Lunark, which takes inspiration from classics like Out of this World and Flashback. Check out the full list of options below.</p><p>Like other Build-you-own bundle deal at Fanatical, this deal offers a sliding payscale, with the price per game dropping as you add more to your cart. The deal starts at three games for $9 ($3 per game). At five or more games, you'll pay just $2.80 for each game, and at seven or more, it's just $2.60 per key. You can add all 23 games to your bundle if you like, which will cost $59.80 (a $399.67 value).</p><ul><li>100% Orange Juice - Game of the Year Every Year Edition</li><li>8-Bit Adventures 2</li><li>Aura of Worlds</li><li>Beyond Galaxyland</li><li>Bore Blasters</li><li>Discopup</li><li>Faith</li><li>Heavy Rain &amp; Beyond: 2 Souls Collection</li><li>Kamikaze Lassplanes</li><li>Lunark</li><li>Maze Mice</li><li>Mr. Sun's Hatbox</li><li>Pinball Spire</li><li>Snowman Storm</li><li>Soda Crisis</li><li>South of the Circle</li><li>Sunrise's Order</li><li>Takara Cards</li><li>Tiny Life</li><li>Trackline Express</li><li>Tyrant's Realm</li><li>Wolfenstein: The New Order</li><li>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</li></ul><hr><h2>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502"></a><figcaption>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025 Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg"></figure><p>This new <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+23+Steam+Deck-Ready+PC+Games+With+This+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-02+16%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-02+17%3A12%3A56&amp;fnarticle_id=6536656&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-killer-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-bundlefest-dec-2025%2F1100-6536656%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killer Bundle Winter 2025 edition</a> marks Fanatical's 1,500th PC game bundle deal, so appropriately enough, it has a long list of game from a variety of genres to choose from. There are shooters like Doom 64, Chernoblite - Premium Edition, and Sniper Elite V2: Remastered, action RPGs and roguelikes such as Reignbreaker, atmospheric adventure games like Bramble: the Mountain King and Deliver Us The Mon, and more. You can even pick up one of the great dungeon crawling RPGs--and the first game from acclaimed dev team Arkane Studios--Arx Fatalis. Pricing for this bundle starts at five games for $5.75 ($1.15 per game), and the price per key drops as you add more games. Pick 10 or more games and you pay just $1 per key, and at 20 or more games you'll pay just $0.95 for each. There's no limit to how many games you can pick, and if you add all 28 possible titles to your bundle, you'll pay just $26.59--that's a huge markdown from the bundle's full $682.79 value.

The patch notes for Burning Springs also highlight new Bounty features, more wildlife, and the introduction of The Ghoul character from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bGPRrcnJ5Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Although Fallout 76's main setting is the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Appalachia, players can now explore a brand-new bordering area with a setting in rural Ohio. Burning Springs is described as a region of southeastern Ohio affected by nuclear destruction and environmental poisoning from a chemical plant. This map expansion offers players a new questline that features a Super Mutant known as the Rust King.</p><p dir="ltr">Highway Town is a main point-of-interest for the new region, and it serves as a social hub for some of the game's new characters. A notable location to visit is the town's Last Resort saloon, which is where players can meet Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, from the TV series.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features for the Burning Springs update is Bounty Hunting events. Players can collect "Grunt Hunt" bounties while in town, and these mark mutated targets to take down. There are also more challenging "Head Hunt" bounties, and these contracts offer unique rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Burning Springs adds new wildlife to the game. Players can add a new creature, the Radhog, as a Camp pet. The water sources in the region introduce new fish types to fish out and collect as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there are new Legendary mods, more public events, new items to craft, and other content available with the Burning Springs update.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the December 2 Burning Springs update can be found below, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2tpInvSHR0w7C8GXqEEbrz/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Bethesda Studios</a>.</p><h2>Fallout 76: Burning Springs Release Notes</h2><h3>Update Highlights</h3><ul><li>Bounty Hunting – Grab your duster, cowboy hat, and your favorite weapon because it’s time for some Bounty Hunting!</li><li>Explore Burning Springs – Cross Point Pleasant Bridge to enter a new land of rust and blood.

It’s time for you to travel westward towards Burning Springs. Taking place in rural Ohio, this is our largest map expansion to Fallout 76 yet!</p><p>Become one of the meanest Bounty Hunters around, as the Burning Springs update introduces Bounty Hunting to your Fallout 76 experience. A major new piece of content here to give you the opportunity to find and eliminate some of the area’s largest threats.</p><p>We’re extremely excited to share that The Ghoul from the Fallout TV Show on Amazon Prime will be joining us in Burning Springs! Voiced by Walton Goggins himself, The Ghoul will be your guide in all things Bounty Hunting.</p><p>The main questline for Burning Springs is just the start of your story in this new region. Planned as the beginning chapter for a story that spans multiple updates, this quest works as an introduction to characters that you’ll end up spending more time with down the line.</p><p>With a new questline for you to complete, two new public events, the introduction of Bounty Hunting, plus a load of additional content (including new fish and a local legend to catch), Burning Springs is our largest update since Wastelanders back in 2020.</p><h3>Welcome to Ohio</h3><p>Burning Springs, a region of southeastern Ohio rocked not only by the nuclear destruction of the bombs dropping, but also the environmental poisoning from the local Abraxodyne Chemical plant. The area is now a desolate and barren wasteland with poisonous water, and a dust storm coating everything in a toxin known as Rust.</p><p>Who would ever want to call this land home? The Rust King is who would.</p><p>A Super Mutant with just as much brains as brawn, The Rust king is the unrelenting and unforgiving ruler of Burning Springs. He has twisted the land into his cruel kingdom, where the only rule is "might makes right."</p><p>Players will cross paths with this monstrous monarch during the new questline. He will task the player with proving their worth and braving the wilds of his wasteland.</p><p>While barren, Burning Springs still holds pockets of life. Highway Town serves as a pit stop for the last of humanity. Built on a section of elevated highway, players will be able to rest and resupply here.</p><p>Highway Town serves as the region's new social hub and a last resort for survivors-- speaking of which, The Last Resort saloon at the end of town also serves up Bounty Hunt contracts.</p><p>Once you unlock the location, you'll be able to fast travel directly to the saloon for maximum Bounty Hunt efficiency!</p><p>You can wander into Burning Springs by crossing the bridge in Point Pleasant. The questline can be started by tuning into the Ohio Distress Signal once they've reached level 30."</p><h3>Bounty Hunting</h3><p>Mosey down to the Last Resort saloon in Highway Town if you're looking to put your gun to work. The Ghoul has set up shop there, providing piles of bounties to plunder.</p><p>To start a Grunt Hunt, just pick up one of the posters off the table. There's plenty to go around, so you can repeat this activity to your heart's content.</p><p>Each time you start a Grunt Hunt, a random location in Burning Springs will be chosen, and a mutation will be applied to your target. Watch out, though, because these mutations are contagious: enemies near your target will also benefit from the effects of the mutation!</p><p>Plan accordingly to take out your target without getting overwhelmed. Adjust your build to counteract their mutation or just go for the classic stealth approach.</p><p>If you're lucky, a Grunt Hunt target might drop a premium Bounty Poster. These will allow you to start a Head Hunt-- an extra challenging bounty hunt in the form of a public event! (Note: these are granted through the Quest Rewards and not found on the body itself.)</p><p>Just place your poster on the bounty board outside of the saloon to send the word wide. All players on the server will be alerted to show up to your aid when you do. Only one Head Hunt can be active at a time, though, so be sure to join in any actives ones before trying to start your own.</p><p>There's dozens of unique Head Hunt targets across a handful of locations. Each has a unique loadout and posse protecting them-- some with pretty wild and weird skills, too!</p><p>If you've got an itchy trigger finger, and caps to spare, The Ghoul would be more than happy to part with a premium poster… for the right price.</p><p>Players will be able to track which Head Hunts they've completed from their Challenges and earn a variety of unique rewards for doing so.</p><p>Speaking of loot, Bounty Hunting is primed to be the premiere path for Legendary Item hunters. Grunt Hunt targets will initially appear as 1-star Legendary enemies. As you complete more, they will eventually make their way toward 2 and 3-star!</p><p>Head Hunt targets will always appear as 3-star legendaries and are flanked by a pair of 2-star posse members.</p><p>But, most importantly, Head Hunts have a chance to drop items with NEW 1-, 2-, and 3-star Legendary effects. Some of these will offer special bonuses for Ghoul or human players…</p><h4>New Legendary Mods</h4><p>As mentioned above, you’ll be able to earn items containing new and exclusive-to-Bounty-Hunting Legendary Mods.</p><ul><li>New 1-Star * Mods</li><li>Feral (Melee Weapon) - Kills make you more feral.</li><li>Sniper's (Ranged Weapon) – Gain 120% bonus damage to weak-points while aiming down sights.</li><li>Adrenal (Weapon) - +10% Damage per kill while on a kill streak.</li><li>Adrenal (Armor) - +10% Damage resistance while on a kill streak.</li><li>Lucid (Weapon) - Increase damage up to 40% based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>Lucid (Armor ) - Increase damage up to 6% resistance based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>New 2-Star** Mods</li><li>Pick Pocketer's (Melee Weapon) - Kills have a 50% chance to award a small amount of caps.</li><li>Pain Killer (Armor) - Gain HP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 HP per second)</li><li>Rushing (Armor) - Gain AP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 AP per second)</li><li>Elementalist's (Armor) - +5 All Resistances (up to +25)</li><li>Fierce (Armor only, not Power Armor) - Fortify limb resistance while on a skill streak (up to 10%, max 50%)</li><li>New 3-Star*** Mods</li><li>Glowing (Weapon) - Kills grant a small amount of Rads.</li><li>Healthy (Armor) - Max HP increased by 20 (up to 100)</li><li>Reflex (Armor) - 2% Evade (up to 10)</li><li>Active (Armor) - Max AP is increased by +20 (up to 100)</li><li>Barbarian (Melee) - +1 STR per kill while on a kill streak.</li></ul><h3>New Public Events</h3><p>Gearin’ Up</p><p>Have you ever wanted to help a Deathclaw prepare for its debut in an Arena deathmatch? Now’s your chance!</p><p>The Rust King requires a new combatant. Your job is to head over to the Junkyard and help The Beastmaster gather the scrap metal needed to armor up her latest tamed Deathclaw.</p><p>During this public event, you'll fight alongside your Deathclaw-in-training against the wastelands wildest foes. Just be sure to keep the beast alive! It can't die a glorious death in the arena if doesn't survive the junkyard first…</p><p>Remember: you can heal friendly NPCs using the Medic's Legendary Mod. Don't have one? Well luckily a new unique named weapon, the Stimpike, comes with this pre-installed! You'll have a chance to earn it-- alongside many other rewards-- by completing this event.</p><p>Sinkhole Solutions</p><p>Fires rage beneath the surface of Burning Springs and natural gas deposits occasionally breach the surface near places where the ground has broken.</p><p>Willow, a resident of Highway Town, needs your help culling Radscorpions and Stingwings that have gathered around a highly volatile sinkhole. These creatures are causing issues for the residents of Highway Town so you’ll need to head over to the aptly named Scorpion Lake to activate a “stomper” device to draw them out of their dens.</p><p>Your objective will be to destroy their dens, all while dodging pillars of fire and navigating a blinding sandstorm.</p><p>Also, stick around to the end to learn why Radscorpions aren't an apex predator…</p><h3>Additional Content</h3><p>More Fish</p><p>Assuming you can even find them, the watering holes around Burning Springs are poisonous and irradiated, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t new fish to catch. Explore this new zone and find new fish (including a Local Legend) to add to your collections.</p><p>Side Quest: Dirty Laundry</p><p>Keep a sharp eye out for mysterious Abraxodyne intel briefcases hidden all over Burning Springs. Return them to Bodhi in the city of Athens to take part in the Dirty Laundry side quest.</p><p>Unlike other collectibles, these brief cases appear in specific locations, once per player. You'll have to search every nook and cranny to find all 150.</p><p>(Schoolyard rumors say there's a 151st one hidden under a red truck, but we're pretty sure that's made-up.)</p><p>As you turn these cases in, you'll help Bodhi unravel the mystery of his missing daughter-- and earn unique Abraxodyne-themed rewards along the way.</p><p>You'll earn a unique Legendary weapon for completing the quest-- which only requires finding about half of the total cases-- but you'll get an even more powered-up version if you find every last one.</p><h3>Season 23: Blood X Rust</h3><p>Season 23: Blood X Rust is here to inspire you to unleash your inner raider spirit.</p><h3>Closing Milepost Zero</h3><p>The bandits roaming Skyline Valley looking for caravans to rob have proved themselves to be dastardly threats to the Blue Ridge Caravan Company. Scaring poor brahmin into going off track, leaving deliveries incomplete.</p><p>For now, Milepost Zero will be closing shop and moving their wares to other vendors across Highway Town. Awaiting a time in the future when things might be a bit safer for their operations.</p><p>The rewards from Milepost Zero are now spread across the Wasteland:</p><ul><li>Plans for the V63 Laser Carbin and mods have been moved to the Weapon Vendor Splint in Highway Town.</li><li>Mac in Highway Town will sell the following items:</li><li>Rolled Persian Rug</li><li>Persian Wall Rug</li><li>Makeshift Wine Rack</li><li>Noren Curtains</li><li>Park Ranger Supply Box</li><li>Persian Rug</li><li>Stargazer’s Telescope</li><li>Lightning Battery Lamp</li><li>Noren Awing</li><li>Snow Globes from the Milepost Zero vendors will now be sold by Windy in Highway Town (she is a Gold Bullion vendor).</li><li>Spooky Scorched will reward the Lederhosen Outfit &amp; Hat, Redcoat Outfit *Hat, and the Vault Girl/Vault Boy backpacks.</li><li>Holiday Scorched will reward all the Skyline Valley specific Snow Globes.</li></ul><p>All characters who completed the “A Bump In the Road” Caravan intro quest will receive the title “Caravan Investor” (immediately upon logging in).</p><p>We will also be granting a pennant that can be used account wide (any character on the account will have access to this pennant) and characters that have completed the quest will also receive 2K Gold Bullion. The Pennant will be granted during the first week of Burning Spring’s release while players should expect to see the 2K Gold Bullion upon logging into characters who have completed then quest.</p><p>We believe that Bounty Hunting delivers on the same promise of on-demand content, with Legendary enemies, and great rewards in a more succinct and satisfying way. We love the Skyline Valley region and have some fun things planned.</p><h3>New C.A.M.P. Pet - Radhog</h3><p>One of the new creatures you’ll find in Burning Springs is the Radhog. They’re tough and fiercely protective of their young, so if you get too close expect to be attacked.</p><p>What would happen if you brought one to your C.A.M.P.? You would probably have the most adorably disgusting pet this side of the Ohio River!</p><p>After purchasing the Radhog C.A.M.P. Pet from the Atomic Shop, the radhog bed item can be found in the “Dwellers” section of the Workshop menu and its Nose Ring is in the “Pet Clothing” section of the Armor Workbench.</p><h3>New Seasonal Weapon – Dom Pedro</h3><p>A new weapon is entering the fray.</p><p>The Dom Pedro is a Hand Cannon that can fire .50 rounds or be swapped to .308. It has an explosive effect and can pierce enemies too. Really sending a message to anyone foolish enough to stand in your way.</p><h3>Emote Wheel</h3><p>Whether you’re hitting your favorite emote at the wandering traveler passing by in the hulking Power Armor skin or trying to convince a level 30 Vault Dweller to pick up the loot you just dropped for them, emoting is core to the Appalachian way of living.</p><p>In the Burning Springs update we’re reorganizing emotes so that more emotes can be equipped at once.</p><p>We’re doing this by:</p><ul><li>introducing 2 new categories, “Social” and “Performance”</li><li>removing the “Follow Me” and “Team Up” categories and placing most of their emotes into “Help” and “Social”</li><li>reorganizing the emotes in the “Misc” so that more of them live in more appropriate categories like “Performance” and “Taunt”.</li></ul><p>With the work done here, you can now equip all your favorite emotes at once with little to no need to go into the Atomic Shop to swap them in and out.</p><h3>Gleaming Depths</h3><p>Almost a year after its introduction, Gleaming Depths has proved to be an excellent place for players looking for an endgame challenge to push themselves and their builds to the limit.</p><p>We’re introducing a new weekly challenge for Gleaming Depths that can be completed by working through all stages of the raid. Your reward for doing so will be a 4-Star Legendary cache that contains a 4-Star Armor, Power Armor, Melee Weapon, and a Ranged Weapon.</p><p>To go along with this new weekly challenge, we’re also redistributing the raid rewards so that the farther you progress in Gleaming Depths the more enticing the rewards will be. We know this may cause some disruption to your local EN06 farming group (and you can still farm him for XP), but it was never our intention to have one phase of the raiding experience be the source of some of the most coveted rewards in the game.</p><p>In this update we’re also fixing numerous bugs and introducing quality-of-life improvements to make the raiding experience smoother for everyone.</p><hr><h3>Combat</h3><p>Combat in Appalachia has experienced a lot of changes since the Skyline Valley update was released last year. For Burning Springs we’re slowing things down to see how it all settles.</p><p>We are making a few more adjustments to V.A.T.S. to address the feedback we’ve received after the Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp update. All in all, you should experience far less instance of V.A.T.S. chance to hit fluctuations and targeting issues.</p><ul><li>Fixed cryo slow being applied to players who aren't in PvP.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Hack and Slash could damage players outside of PvP.</li></ul><h3>C.A.M.P.</h3><ul><li>All items from the Mischief Night rewards now appear in the Build menu.</li><li>Build budgets of various items have been adjusted.</li><li>Fixed an issue which could cause the Store/Scrap button to not work when pressed by the player.</li><li>Straw Goat decoration plans are now known by default for all players.</li><li>Fixed issue where C.A.M.P.
