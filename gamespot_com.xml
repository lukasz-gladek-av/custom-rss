                <p>The success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game.</p><p>"It's more pressure," Larian founder Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/swen-vincke-says-theres-definitely-more-pressure-to-nail-divinity-after-the-smash-success-of-baldurs-gate-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.</p><p>"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'" added Vincke. "By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn."</p><p>Vincke recently came under fire for saying that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">Larian uses some generative AI</a> in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to "explore things" and that it allows artists to "experiment" and "make their lives easier." He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.</p><p>According to Vincke, Divinity will probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/" data-ref-id="1100-6537011">get an early-access release</a> like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.</p><h2>How to complete A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step to completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders is to head back to the drain where you previously found the barrel for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-source-of-the-contamination-quest-guide/1100-6535935/" data-ref-id="1100-6535935">Source of the Contamination</a> quest. This barrel can be found outside the Water Treatment Center on the Dam Battlegrounds map by approaching from the north via the swamp. Check the map below for the exact spot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157"></a><figcaption>Water Treatment Control drain location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg"></figure><p>This time, you won't need to interact with the barrel. Instead, simply walk around in this nasty water for a moment to trigger the next step of the quest, which asks you to find traces of the barrel's origin. Luckily, you won't need to travel far at all to round up where the barrel came from.</p><p>Walk to the west just a bit to find a truck in the swamp water. It's hard to miss since it's sitting out in the open, but we've marked the location on the map for you below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158"></a><figcaption>Find a truck submerged in the water here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Approach the truck and interact with the prompt that shows up to take a photo of it. Afterward, you'll receive a final task to search the trucks for clues about who sabotaged the water supply. Just interact with the door of the truck to find a Spaceport Warehouse Key. Pick it up and place it in your safe pocket, as it can come in handy for finding good loot next time you're in Spaceport.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156"></a><figcaption>This truck is the source of the contamination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that you're finished with the quest, you can extract at the nearby Central Swamp Lift. Just be mindful that this area can be easily camped by other raiders, so keep your wits about you. When you return to Speranza and turn this quest in, you'll receive a follow-up quest called The Stench of Corruption, which you'll need to complete if you want to earn the Warden outfit.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

                <p>Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p>For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><p>If you're playing on Xbox or PC, you can access Black Ops 7 with Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass.

This could help explain why Activision is offering a discount on the game about a month after launch, though there could be other reasons as well.</p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's initial sales may have been lower, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game in the US so far.</a> On December 17, we will find out from Circana how Black Ops 7 sold in the US, though the game's availability on Game Pass will put an asterisk on its sales performance.</p>

                <p>In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>"It's progressing really well," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>. "The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right."</p><p>Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-a-skyrim-trailer-might-secretly-reveal-elder-scrolls-6s-release-year/1100-6536892/" data-ref-id="1100-6536892">reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer</a> as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">recently as last month</a>, Howard said that The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off" and he expressed regret for announcing the sequel when he did. Earlier this year, Bethesda teamed up with Make-A-Wish for a charity auction to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-donate-to-make-a-wish-for-a-chance-to-design-an-elder-scrolls-6-character/1100-6529534/" data-ref-id="1100-6529534">design a creature in Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p>Howard also held open the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/" data-ref-id="1100-6536747">an Elder Scrolls TV series</a>, much like the hit Fallout show on Prime Video. However, Howard indicated that he's "willing to say 'no' for a decade" rather than rush into that.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

                <p>There are a lot of quests to complete in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, but only a few send you beneath Spaceport's Launch Tower to navigate its dark and dreary tunnels. One of these quests, The Clean Dream, asks you to begin by searching containers and monitoring a filtration system before sending you off to a whole new map. If you're looking to tackle this quest, we've got everything you need to know below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Search_4_containers_in_the_underground_tunnels">Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels</a></li><li><a href="#Find_and_monitor_any_filtration_system_in_the_tunnels">Find and monitor any filtration system in the tunnels</a></li><li><a href="#Visit_the_Maintenance_Bunker">Visit the Maintenance Bunker</a></li><li><a href="#Monitor_the_purification_system_in_the_bunker">Monitor the purification system in the bunker</a></li><li><a href="#Find_and_photograph_the_blueprints_in_the_bunker">Find and photograph the blueprints in the bunker</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Search_4_containers_in_the_underground_tunnels">Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels</h2><p>First, you're headed to Spaceport to search four containers in the underground tunnels. These tunnels run all along the center of the map, and there are a variety of ways to get down there and navigate them. However, the most common and easily-accessible entrance will be the same spot you visited during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-switching-the-supply-quest-guide/1100-6535934/" data-ref-id="1100-6535934">Switching the Supply</a> quest, which is a collapsed section a bit southwest of the Launch Tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624037-share_20251216_0529480.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624037" data-ratio="0.55746140651801" data-width="2915" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624037-share_20251216_0529480.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624037"></a><figcaption>This is the best entrance to the tunnels for most players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624037-share_20251216_0529480.jpeg"></figure><p>While you're down here, you can search any lootable container--including "breach &amp; search" boxes--to complete this part of the quest. Even if something has been opened and searched by another raider, you'll get credit for searching it yourself.</p><h2 id="Find_and_monitor_any_filtration_system_in_the_tunnels">Find and monitor any filtration system in the tunnels</h2><p>After you've searched the four containers in the tunnels, you'll be tasked with finding and monitoring any filtration system. There are plenty of these throughout the tunnels, but the most accessible is likely the one right where you came into the tunnels at the collapsed entrance. It's actually directly beside the valve you turn during the aforementioned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-switching-the-supply-quest-guide/1100-6535934/" data-ref-id="1100-6535934">Switching the Supply</a> quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624036-19b282f685166-screenshoturl-copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624036-19b282f685166-screenshoturl-copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624036"></a><figcaption>This is what a Filtration System looks like in the tunnels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624036-19b282f685166-screenshoturl-copy.jpg"></figure><p>Regardless of which filtration system you find and monitor, though, your next step will be to extract and head back to Speranza. Then, you'll want to set off to Blue Gate.</p><h2 id="Visit_the_Maintenance_Bunker">Visit the Maintenance Bunker</h2><p>On Blue Gate, you'll need to head to the Maintenance Bunker, which is located southeast of the Checkpoint POI.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624041-share_20251216_0547160.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624041" data-ratio="0.56471095772217" data-width="2318" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624041-share_20251216_0547160.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624041"></a><figcaption>Maintenance Bunker location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624041-share_20251216_0547160.jpeg"></figure><p>The entrance to this underground area can be located around the "N" in the word "Maintenance" on your map.</p><h2 id="Monitor_the_purification_system_in_the_bunker">Monitor the purification system in the bunker</h2><p>When you head inside the Maintenance Bunker, you'll be asked to monitor the purification system. Luckily, you won't need to go far, as this can be found in the main room here. Just interact with the large cylinders here to wrap up this part of the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624074-share_20251216_0603171.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624074-share_20251216_0603171.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624074"></a><figcaption>Interact with the purification system down here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624074-share_20251216_0603171.jpeg"></figure><p>However, you'll still have one last task to complete while you're down in the bunker.</p><h2 id="Find_and_photograph_the_blueprints_in_the_bunker">Find and photograph the blueprints in the bunker</h2><p>After you check the cylinders (purification system), head back up the stairs to the walkway. Head into the little side room on the right here, which contains lockers and a Security Breach, and check the stack of blueprints on the desk for your photo opportunity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624075-share_20251216_0603160.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624075" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624075-share_20251216_0603160.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624075"></a><figcaption>Take a photograph of the blueprints to complete the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624075-share_20251216_0603160.jpeg"></figure><p>When you interact with the blueprints to take a photo, you'll complete the quest. This means you're now free to extract (or die trying). Thankfully, you'll find that there's an extraction point just outside the Maintenance Bunker, so head there if it isn't already closed. Once you're back in Speranza, chat with Apollo to turn the quest in.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>
