                <p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, Celeste has requested that you find two of her journals she left topside, and it's going to take a bit of effort to round them up. In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest. This can be tough to pull off due to the long trek you'll need to make through potentially dangerous areas to gather both of them, so also be sure to bring a decent gun and enough ammo to keep you feeling safe.</p><p>When you're ready to set off and finish this challenging quest, follow the steps below. Just remember that it's probably best that you loot the outpost closest to your spawn point first, then head off toward the other.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Celeste___s_journal_at_the_South_Swamp_Outpost">Where to find Celeste’s journal at the South Swamp Outpost</h2><p>One of Celeste's journals can be located within the South Swamp Outpost.

                <p>As part of Take-Two's earnings report today, the company confirmed that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed and is now coming November 19, 2026. That is a delay of 5 months and 24 days from its previously scheduled May 26, 2026 release date.</p><p>"We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar said.</p><p>Take-Two's stock price took a beating after the news was announced, falling by nearly $30 per share in after-hours trading. "Rockstar Games will now release Grand Theft Auto VI on November 19, 2026, and we remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," Take-Two said.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> of the delay, "We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Zelnick said, "When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened."</p><p>He added: "We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>  — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>On Take-Two's quarterly earnings call, Zelnick suggested that pushing Rockstar to hit GTA 6's previously-announced release date could be bad for the game, and therefore, bad for the company.</p><p>"It's always painful when we move a date," he said. "We have done so occasionally in the past, and we've never regretted it in retrospect. I would like to point out that we've had some competitors, in the event where more polish was required and it required slipping a date, they chose not to slip the date, and they did so at their peril."</p><p>GTA 6 has already been delayed publicly once, as the game was originally expected to launch right around now in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed it to May 2026. At the time, Rockstar said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">needed more time to make a game that exceeded fan expectations.</a> In fact, the game's second trailer was released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">exactly six months ago today on May 6, 2025.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5, and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

Now, one player has taken his love for the game to the next level by breaking a new world record for the longest video game marathon. It only took 144 hours over the course of six days, and years of training before making the attempt.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hEKmxYvdZw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5hEKmxYvdZw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As documented on the official site for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/11/gamer-breaks-iconic-videogame-record-by-playing-dance-dance-revolution-for-six-days" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records</a>, Hungarian gamer Szabolcs Csépe--who also goes by GrassHopper--pulled off his feat between October 23-29, 2024. It's estimated that he danced to over 3,000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in that span. The previous record was set in 2015 by American gamer Carrie Swidecki, who set her mark at 138 hours 34 seconds on Just Dance.</p><p>Csépe told the site that his attempt "was the most physically demanding experience" in part because he spent hours moving without stretching. He also noted that he needed the help of a small staff of people to keep him him fed and drinking enough water to see the attempt through to the end. </p><p>"What also added to the challenge was managing and documenting all witness activities and their time allocation by myself; essentially before, during and after the record attempt," said Csépe. "Motivation is always a given with rhythm and music games! Those who love this genre can always tell that there is nothing more encouraging than dancing or doing body workout while listening to your favorite tunes."</p><p>Csépe already secured a handful of world records before this attempt, including the longest video game marathon playing a puzzle game while playing Tetris Effect for 32 hours 32 minutes 32 seconds; and the longest video game marathon playing a racing game for a 90-hour session on Gran Turismo 7. For now, Csépe hasn't decided which record to chase next.</p>
