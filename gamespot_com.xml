                <p dir="ltr">We're living in a golden age of new Dragon Ball games, and if you're looking to score a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> discount on a recent release, you're in luck, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is just $50</a> currently. Normally priced at $70, Sparking Zero is the newest chapter in the venerable Tenkaichi Budokai series, a line of Dragon Ball games that has been dormant for quite a few years.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero (PS5)</a> -- $50 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBQGRQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero (Xbox Series X)</a> -- $50 ($<del>70</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The long wait between releases has paid off, as Sparking Zero is a fast and furious brawler that looks amazing in action. For Dragon Ball fans, it's a game with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-every-confirmed-character/2900-5470/" data-ref-id="2900-5470">absurdly massive roster</a> that allows for dream fights to unfold between iconic characters like Goku and Vegeta, new faces like Jiren, and even obscure fighters who've only been seen in a handful of episodes. If you can overlook the repetitive side of the combat and you're looking for a fighting game that has deep gameplay mechanics to master, there's a lot to appreciate here.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the most part, the Tenkaichi approach still works thanks to its fast and energized battle system; however, repetitive gameplay and limited mode options leave us wanting more from this battle," Jason Fanelli wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review/1900-6418295/" data-ref-id="1900-6418295">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero review</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can also check out Tekken 8 for another solid fighting game option.

Like previous Tekken games, it's a hard-hitting affair featuring a stacked cast of characters, each one wielding a unique martial arts style that you can master in 3D arenas. If you'd like to stick to Dragon Ball specifically, the last couple of games released all offer neat experiences.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BANDAI-NAMCO-Entertainment-1209334-Dragon/dp/B0BHT4JJ1N?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> has a deeper RPG gameplay design that covers Goku's journey through the Dragon Ball Z storylines, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BQ4QG4QY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> is a superb 2.5D fighting game by Guilty Gear studio Arc System Works, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DRAGON-BALL-XENOVERSE-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0CWVR3QM9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball XenoVerse 2</a> allows you to create your own legendary fighter who'll help protect timelines from shenanigans.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo continues to mine(cart) developer Rare's back catalog for Switch Online, as Donkey Kong Land is the latest addition to the subscription service. The Game Boy game--which originally launched in 1995--is now available on Switch Online.</p><p dir="ltr">Coming out a year after Donkey Kong Country on SNES, Donkey Kong Land saw Rare trying to bring the same sort of side-scrolling experience to the less-powerful Game Boy.

In February, five classic Rare games came to the service, such as Killer Instinct and R.C. Pro-Am. That lineup also saw Blast Corps land on Switch Online + Expansion Pack, the premium tier for the subscription service. A basic Switch Online sub costs $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack upgrade is $50 annually.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banjo-tooie-coming-to-ie-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack/1100-6527254/" data-ref-id="1100-6527254">Banjo-Tooie hit Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, almost three years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-switch-online-in-january/1100-6498881/" data-ref-id="1100-6498881">the original Nintendo 64 game landed on the service</a>.

                <p>Blizzard is holding another PTR (Public Test Realm) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, testing some of the new features and content that will be arriving in Season 7 next year. Here's everything Diablo 4 players on PC will be able to preview during the 2.1 update test period, which will run December 3-10.</p><p>One of the major new features previewed in the 2.1 PTR is the Armory, a new feature that will allow players to swap between different builds easily. The Armory lets you save, load, and name your favorite character builds, with five different built slots allotted per character. Loadouts will save a character's equipped items, Paragon Board and Glyphs, skill selections, and class mechanic. Switching between them will display the relevant details at a glance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg"></figure><p>2.1 will also let players master Witchcraft, with three new schools of Hawezar sorcery to learn. These include Eldritch, which focuses on destructive energies and polymorphy; Psyche, a defensive magic based on mind and spirit; and Growth &amp; Decay, a type of magic based on the dichotomy of healing and harming.</p><p>Players will have to complete seasonal tasks to learn Witchcraft, completing new Whisper bounties and defeating the new Headrotten enemies to earn Restless Rot. This new seasonal currency can be exchanged at a Coven's Altar at the Tree of Whispers to unlock and upgrade new Witchcraft powers. The full list of available powers, at least for the PTR version of Witchcraft, can be found below.</p><p>As part of the seasonal content, players will be tasked with hunting the new Headrotten enemy, which can be found in Headhunt subzones and Roothold micro-dungeons. Headrotten also have a few unique boss variants, including the Headless Husk and Fugitive Head. The latter harbors a parasitic Stolen Head, which can be collected upon its defeat and returned to Gelena in exchange for Occult Gems.</p><p>Another new feature, Occult Gems can be placed into items with available sockets to add unique effects and upgrades that complement the new Witchcraft powers. Gelena will also craft Occult Gems in exchange for Restless Rot, Gem Fragments, and Fugitive Heads. The full list of Occult Gems and their effects can be found below.</p><p>The PTR test will also include a number of new Runes, Legendary Aspects, and Unique Items, all of which are detailed below.</p><p>In order to test out the update between December 3-10, players can download the PTR through the Battle.net app, by selecting the Public Test Realm option from the selector above the Play button. Players can copy in a character from their main account from the PTR's character select screen, and can use the PTR boost NPC in Kyovashad to make sure they're properly specced for the new content.</p><p>Check out all the new powers, upgrades, and items coming to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24162193/the-2-1-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.1 PTR test</a>:</p><h2>Witchcraft Powers</h2><h3>Eldritch Powers</h3><p>Firebat Servants</p><ul><li>A deadly swarm of Firebats swarm enemies every 2 seconds, inflicting X total Fire damage over 1 total attack.</li><li>At Higher Ranks: Enemies are Stunned for 3 seconds after being hit 5 times by your Firebat Servants.</li></ul><p>Abyssal Resonance</p><ul><li>Every 250 Resource spent, release an explosion dealing X Shadow damage.

To mark the occasion, Ubisoft has dropped a launch trailer that explains how Kay Vess and her friends get drawn into an adventure alongside the legendary Lando Calrissian. But it looks like they'll be on opposite sides at the start.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc7FhNxCk8c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oc7FhNxCk8c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>An outlaw's reputation means everything in the underworld, which is how the Empire is able to successfully blackmail Kay into working for them on this mission. If she refuses, the Empire will simply let it be known that Kay is one of their operatives and the various syndicates will mark her for death. To keep the Empire off of her back, Kay also has to win a high-stakes Sabacc tournament against some of the game's best players--who may also be flagrant cheaters like Lando.</p><p>Naturally, this arrangement is destined to go sideways as Lando and Kay escape on her ship. From there, we're not sure where the story is going, but it's an encouraging way to tease the DLC. Ubisoft has also dropped a massive update for the game that--among other things--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">does away with forced stealth missions</a>. From now on, Kay can shoot her way out of some tight spots without failing her mission. Most of the major gameplay changes are laid out in the new video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-X1YI7WIxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2-X1YI7WIxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft has put a lot of post-launch work into Outlaws because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its initial sales were very disappointing</a> and players had a lot of complaints about certain aspects of the game.
