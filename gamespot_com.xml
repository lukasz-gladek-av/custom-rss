PlayStation 5 players can snag the Scarlet Spider skin for free. Paid cosmetics include a Prowler variation of the costume, the Iron Spider costume that more closely matches the character's appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the Bombastic Bag Man, where Peter Parker wears normal street clothes with a paper bag over his head.</p><p dir="ltr">The new costume arrives the same day as Marvel's Spider-Man 2 debuts on PC, the game having originally been released as a PS5 exclusive in October 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals recently began its first season by introducing two new heroes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-mister-fantastic-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-stretching-into-action/2300-6465572/" data-ref-id="2300-6465572">Mr. Fantastic</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-invisible-woman-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-unseen-force/2300-6465576/" data-ref-id="2300-6465576">Invisible Woman</a>, alongside some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-update-is-full-of-buffs-and-nerfs-for-each-role-full-patch-notes/1100-6528702/" data-ref-id="1100-6528702">significant balance changes to buff its most underwhelming characters</a>.
