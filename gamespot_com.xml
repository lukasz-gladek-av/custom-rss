                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> arrives this August, it'll adopt a key aspect of College Football 25: its speed. Ask anyone who's played both of EA's American football games over the last year and they'll surely tell you College Football is much faster--they'll probably also tell you they preferred it over Madden's intentionally more sluggish gameplay. At the time, College Football was finding its old self, as the game was the first in EA's series in 11 years, and the entries of yesteryear tended to play faster and looser than Madden, too.</p><p dir="ltr">For the NFL sim, however, the slower gameplay was meant to differentiate it from College Football, and capture the way NFL players are on more even footing than their collegiate counterparts, where the delta between pro-bound elites and average student-athletes should and does feel vast. However, the Madden team has considered a great deal of community feedback and has decided to accelerate Madden 26, bringing it closer to the feel of the College Football series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">EA Tiburon's Isaac Etheridge, also known as "Spade" from his days as a Madden content creator, spoke at length about the changes players can expect, specifically based on player feedback. He led with game speed, signaling just how much the team understands this was an area it had to focus on. "We believe the NFL is the home of the fastest, most explosive players on the planet, right?So we knew something had to change. We started to validate this, both internally and externally," Etheridge said, explaining how the team used a prospective build of a faster Madden to test its favorability with players.</p><p>"We took a build of Madden 25--a special build with different locomotion--and we sent that out, and we asked people some very direct questions: 'Do you feel like you have more control? Is this more fun?' We validated this, and we realized our players want more control. They want more speed. They want that explosion. It was an easy decision to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Etheridge explained that Madden 26 doesn't precisely port over College Football 25's exact locomotion. Instead, it features a merging of "the best tuning sets" from both the Madden and College Football 25 locomotion systems. "We don't want you to play one game and say, 'Okay, this feels fast,' and play another game and go, 'What happened? Same [player] ratings--what happened? Why is this guy not as fast?' So we put both games on parity with a new locomotion set that we believe is the best for both types."</p><p dir="ltr">Soon after Etheridge spoke, I got to play Madden 26 for the first time, and I could see what he meant. It's not exactly like College Football 25, which still feels looser and faster overall, but Madden 26 surely feels closer. Madden 25 was, in my estimation, the first "slow" Madden since Madden 22, with 21, 23, and 24 all feeling faster in recent years. As you can probably infer (if you don't already know personally), the Madden game speed problem has long been a frustrating variable. Some games feel right, others don't, but consistency was elusive. You couldn't get used to how Madden felt because that feeling wasn't long for this world. However, it now seems that player feedback has been overwhelmingly in favor of a faster football game, leading the Madden team to adopt this style well into the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340" data-ratio="0.59205426356589" data-width="1032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340"></a><figcaption>Players like Xavier Worthy will feel more dangerous in Madden 26 thanks to its new locomotion system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506341,1300-4506342,1300-4506343,1300-4506344,1300-4506345" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My hope is that the re-emergence of College Football as an annual series helps guide the Madden team to more wise decisions like this one. A faster Madden is a better Madden. As Etheridge said when presenting to me and a room of roughly 50 other sports nerds, "a 4.2 [40-yard dash time] should feel like a 4.2." That's true at any level, and it's good to see the Madden team has seemingly figured that out for good this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden 26 is faster, but I'm no longer worried about that attribute being a fleeting high note before it slows down considerably again in Madden 27 or 28. As long as college football continues to earn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-ea-sports-college-football-25-hit-two-huge-us-sales-milestones/1100-6528544/">more money</a>, notch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/">higher review scores</a>, and total <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hit-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/1100-6525421/">more hours played</a> than Madden, it will likely dictate, or at least strongly suggest, the direction of Madden in some key ways. Madden will continue to have plenty of ways to differentiate itself from its brandmate, but in this way, it's wise to play catch-up.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on this year's NFL, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 feels on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-26-had-to-overhaul-several-in-game-mechanics-for-jaguars-rookie-travis-hunter/1100-6532039/" data-ref-id="1100-6532039">how the game was overhauled for one special player</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> is coming this summer, and when it arrives, you'll find that the team at Tiburon has done something it hasn't done before: It's added a new player ability based on a rookie. The game's library of X-Factor and Superstar abilities is a lengthy one that gets new additions every year, but Travis Hunter is the first rookie to inspire the team to think up a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability is called Iron Man, and it's designed to let Hunter play both sides of the ball more effectively. Hunter comes to Jacksonville with the bona fides to play both wide receiver and cornerback, and football experts everywhere are wondering if he can become the NFL's version of Shohei Ohtani: a two-way superstar the likes of whom only come around once in a generation, if that.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden developer Tiburon had to find a way to make this work in-game. Typically, a player who might play on both offense and special teams gets winded more easily, and a tired player is more likely to get hurt, commit penalties, or fumble if they're a ball carrier--not to mention slow down, of course. Because Hunter is expected to play both offense and defense, and has shown, at least in college, an ability to do this remarkably well, the Iron Man ability essentially rewrites his stamina drain. This allows him to fend off fatigue and the game's Wear and Tear injury system, which Madden 26 is adopting from College Football 25 and 26.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608" data-ratio="0.5104" data-width="625" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608"></a><figcaption>Saquon Barkley is on the cover on Madden this year, but it's probably not long before Travis Hunter lands on it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Similarly, a team's depth chart now allows for two-way players like Hunter. Before, if a player was starting on offense or defense, they could not start on the other side. The game wouldn't even populate those positions with most players; only a select few could be subbed in based on positional overlaps, like a safety playing in a linebacker spot in some defensive packages. Players who might appear in special formations--such as the Patriots' Marcus Jones, who can play returner, corner, and wide receiver--were given similar permissions in certain formations only. However, Hunter has forced a more pronounced change, and now players can be two-way players without these long-held restrictions--though that's not to say they'll be good at it.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, Hunter will be something of a unicorn. However, players in Franchise mode who delve deeply into the player-regeneration system--Madden's method of populating future years with fake draft prospects--may find that more two-way players emerge. Finding them and the other new draft archetypes is meant to be like an Easter egg for players, Franchise lead Josh Looman told me. "We'll see people on Reddit be like, 'Hey, I found this one guy.' We have a good laugh about it," Looman continued, "but yeah, we've got a good chunk more [draft prospect archetypes] this year, and we'll continue to do that in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on my time with EA's next NFL sim, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 performs on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-best-feature-is-something-it-learned-from-college-football-25/1100-6532035/" data-ref-id="1100-6532035">how its biggest change is something it learned from College Football 25</a>.</p>
