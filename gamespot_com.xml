                <p>One year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">Netflix brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</a> to its growing mobile-gaming library, two of those games are set to leave the service. Netflix has warned users that they will only have until December 13 to play Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition.</p><p>While GTA 3 and Vice City are both set to leave the service, it seems like San Andreas is staying on Netflix for a while longer, with the game not displaying the same "Leaving Soon" card as the other two. According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/grand-theft-auto-iii-and-vice-city-leaving-netflix-games-in-december-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What's On Netflix</a>, the GTA games were some of the most downloaded in Netflix's library, with San Andreas easily the most popular of the three.</p><p>The GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-now-available-free-through-netflix/1100-6519956/" data-ref-id="1100-6519956">exclusive Netflix mobile release</a> was based on Grove Street Games' remasters for console and PC, but included a number of extra quality-of-life improvements, including a popular "Classic Lighting" mode. Their removal from Netflix comes just after the console and PC remasters received a major update, which added the Classic Lighting mode and other improvements from the mobile editions.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who want to continue playing the mobile versions of GTA 3 and Vice City after December 13 will have to purchase the games outright from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store.</p><p>While movie and TV titles cycle on and off Netflix all the time, this is the first major removal for Netflix's game catalogue, and suggests that not all the titles in the gaming library are there to stay. "Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative confirmed. "Players will notice a 'Leaving Soon' badge and be notified by the app itself well in advance of removal."</p>

The ranked competition will reward exclusive cosmetic items to those who reach certain milestones, including an exclusive champion skin that will be awarded only to the player who comes out on top at the end of the season.</p><p>Separate to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-season-1-rank-reset-explained/1100-6527765/" data-ref-id="1100-6527765">Black Ops 6's Prestige ranks</a>, Ranked Play is designed for the most dedicated players who want to play multiplayer matches with the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions as COD's official esports league. In order to qualify for Ranked Play, players first have to log 50 wins in match-made multiplayer games to unlock access to the ultra-competitive mode. All wins logged since the game was released count towards this, even if the games were played before the start of Season 1.</p><p>Ranked Play has changed a little from previous COD titles, with the ranking system being simplified. In Black Ops 6, players will work through eight ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Progress through the ranks can be made by earning Skill Rating (SR), which can also be lost by losing a match.</p><p>The rewards on offer for Ranked players include a number of Ranked Skins for the Competitor operator, which are unlocked starting at Gold rank. These skins will be unlocked as soon as you achieve a new rank, rather than being rewarded at the end of the season--with the exception of the Top 250 and overall Champion skins. The peak reward, which is set to be one of the most exclusive skins in Black Ops 6, is the Champion skin, resembling a flaming, crowned, skull-headed operator.</p><p>Other rewards can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in Ranked Play, and include the Ranked Competitor Skin, Knife Blueprint, a Frag Grenade Skin, a win-tracking Gunscreen, and more. Each season will also come with its own set of unique seasonal rewards that will only be available to earn during that season.</p><p>Cross-play is mandatory for Ranked Play, meaning console players have the potential to be matched against PC players in all matches. This decision hasn't been popular with fans, with many requesting the option to disable cross-play for the hyper-competitive mode.</p><p>If you're looking at getting competitive in Black Ops 6, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/" data-ref-id="2900-5960">best MP weapon loadouts</a> for Season 1.</p>

                <p>Creators and consumers are tangling with the use of generative AI in everything from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">games</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-ai-made-secret-invasion-opening-prompts-response-from-studio-after-backlash/1100-6515426/" data-ref-id="1100-6515426">TV-show opening sequences</a>, and the sentiment on AI seems to be shifting. To help consumers make decisions about which games to buy, game storefront Itch.io now requires all creators to disclose the use of generative AI in games, Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran announced in a <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post to the site</a>.</p><p>The text of the post itself is fairly straightforward, directed primarily at the creators who will have to disclose this information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080" data-ratio="0.47015610651974" data-width="1089" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080"></a><figcaption>Itch.io's generative-AI disclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png"></figure><p>"We’ve deployed a new field to project edit pages called 'Generative AI disclosure.' This field asks if your project contains the results of generative AI. If you select yes, then we also ask what kinds of generative AI you utilize, including Graphics, Sound, Text &amp; Dialog, and Code," Corcoran wrote. Selecting Yes will give your project an "AI Generated" tag, while selecting No will give it a "No AI" tag.</p><p>Importantly, though, Corcoran notes that "Assets comprised of generative AI (even if modified afterwards) that are not tagged will no longer be eligible for indexing on [Itch.io's] browse pages." The project won't be removed, but will not show up when browsing, and must be discovered through search or a direct link.</p><p>Corcoran is careful not to make a moral judgment of the use of AI, and Itch.io's Content Creator Quality Guidelines state that "we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content."</p><p>As Itch takes this measure, many game developers and publishers are moving to clarify their stances on the technology, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-executive-promotes-ai-game-development-shortly-after-huge-layoffs/1100-6527567/" data-ref-id="1100-6527567">Netflix</a>, and others.</p>
