                <p dir="ltr">In a brief developer preview, Bethesda showed off the upcoming C.A.M.P. Revamp update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-76/" data-ref-id="5000-482770">Fallout 76</a>. This update is geared towards making improvements to the game's CAMP-building mechanics as well as refining the workshop menu system.</p><p dir="ltr">As seen in the video below, Bethesda's creative director Jon Rush discussed the CAMP Revamp update, showing off the new streamlined menus to help make finding specific items faster. There are also new tools and new building rules.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlz9Bqp26BU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We're getting rid of our rules regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free-place anywhere," Rush said. "We see and hear you, sky campers."</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, players have been restricted from building certain modules and items on floating foundations, making it more difficult to build CAMP designs higher up as a form of sky bases. This should make building sky CAMPs easier, but hopefully it will also allow for better placement on the uneven terrain as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The CAMP Revamp update arrives to Fallout 76 on September 2, so players won't need to wait long to get their hands on the game's overhauled building system. Rush also teased that Fallout 76 will feature community CAMP-building contests later in the year, which will feature "huge" prizes.</p><p>The last major update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-fishing-guide-bait-recipes-and-how-to-catch-fish/1100-6532086/">Fallout 76 added fishing mechanics</a> and a new questline with Season 21: Gone Fission. </p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-trailer-suggests-itll-be-the-new-vegas-remaster-everyones-been-asking-for/1100-6534096/">Fallout Season 2</a> was revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live. The trailer suggests the show will lean into the lore of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Forza Horizon 6 hasn't even been officially announced by Microsoft, and yet, a possible leak might have revealed the racing game's setting: Japan. An Australian car import company reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/a/s8U6ckB" rel="nofollow ">posted and then deleted an image</a> on Instagram that showed a developer scanning Japanese kei cars.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://cultandclassic.com.au/" rel="nofollow ">Cult and Classic</a> post was spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" rel="nofollow ">the subreddit Gaming Leaks and Rumours</a>, with Forza Horizon fans extrapolating that the Japanese kei cars (which aren't found in America) strongly hint at Japan for the game's setting. However, there are a couple of reasons this theory could be misguided. For instance, Forza Horizon developer Playground Games is based in the United Kingdom, so cars not being available in the US has no bearing on scanning for the team. Additionally, why wouldn't the dev member just fly out to Japan instead of Australia to scan a kei car, which roughly translates to light vehicle?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s whopping open beta has now come and gone, and Battlefield Studios is addressing the feedback it has received, chiefly as it pertains to the game's bigger maps and criticism of player counts across its modes.</p><p>One of the main concerns for players coming out of the beta was the status of Battlefield 6's larger maps. The biggest one in the beta, Liberation Peak, was popular enough with players who craved the classic large-scale warfare of the series--even if it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">far too many snipers</a>--but many were left wanting more. This feeling was only exacerbated by the beta's apparent focus on smaller maps and modes, like Breakthrough and Rush on infantry-focused arenas like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and eventually, Empire State.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to players starved for bigger maps, which have already been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/much-larger-battlefield-6-maps-revealed-in-datamine-including-new-vehicles/1100-6534039/" data-ref-id="1100-6534039">revealed by dataminers</a>, Battlefield Studios has assured the community that "larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package," and they're on the way. The post elaborates that two of the game's significantly larger maps, one set in Mirak Valley and the other a remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm, will be included in the next phase of Battlefield Labs testing, which is set to continue leading up to Battlefield 6's launch on October 10.</p><p>Fans of Battlefield have come to expect certain things of the games, and one of those core tenets is greater player counts than the average multiplayer FPS title. However, a great deal of these players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">let down</a> when the fan-favorite mode Rush was introduced in the second weekend of the beta with a significantly smaller lobby size than usual, supporting up to 24 players in tight 12v12 matches.</p><p>Rush typically tasks teams with defending and attacking pairs of bomb sites at a time and has supported bigger lobbies in past games, which is what has wrinkled fans of the mode about its implementation in the latest game. It and the 64-player Conquest modes are often looked to as the signature modes of the Battlefield series and emblematic of its emphasis on big battles, so any significant change to it was bound to cause a stir. Battlefield Studios hears the concern from players, but also thinks that this downsizing might be the best move for Rush right now, and that it is in line with what it calls "the golden era" of the mode.</p><p>The team shared, "When it comes to Rush, the conversation we observed wasn't just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer. Rush is a mode with deep roots, originally known as Gold Rush in [Battlefield] Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. Many of you remember this as the golden era of Rush, and it continues to inspire our approach today."</p><p>It then goes on to say that despite toying with bigger lobby sizes in the past, these inflated player counts often led to issues that are streamlined or eliminated outright by cutting back and emphasizing smaller-team tactics. Due to that, the team is sticking with its lowered default player count for Rush, but encourages players wanting large-scale Rush to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">Portal</a>, Battlefield's custom matchmaking and level-building mode.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post goes into more detail about overall beta numbers. As folks may have gathered from the queues, livestreams, videos, and posts on social media, Battlefield 6's open beta was a knockout for EA. According to a graphic released by the team, there were roughly 420 million matches played over the course of the two beta weekends, totaling about 92 million hours of play. Players racked up more than 4.9 billion kills, knocked nearly 4 million jets out of the sky (I was at least half a dozen of those), and did 196 billion dollars in property damage.</p><p>Battlefield 6 releases on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Digital Eclipse has officially confirmed two more games for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, as the infamous PlayStation-era spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces are being added to the compilation. These titles have been unavailable for decades on PC and newer consoles, and Digital Eclipse added that they're being enhanced alongside the other Mortal Kombat games in the roster.</p><p>The studio says that there will be a rewind feature to make gameplay more forgiving, on-screen move lists, and a Trainer Mode to help players learn various combos and fatalities. Players can also expect reduced load times in each game.</p><p>The other big reveal from the studio was that the WaveNet edition of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 will also be included in the collection. This was originally developed to support Midway's ambitious WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcade machines, and it was the only Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature Noob Saibot as a playable character.</p><p>If you want an idea of just how big of a deal it is to have this version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 included, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/osu16bit.bsky.social/post/3lwwbjk72w22d" rel="nofollow ">NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback has a detailed thread</a> on just how ahead of its time the technology was, the significant gameplay changes that were made for this edition, and how this version of the game was thought to be lost to time before a working arcade cabinet was found.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89KZUGXbqY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you never played Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero or Mortal Kombat Special Forces, then you missed out on two <em>interesting </em>games. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997, and it was a sidescrolling action game that still retained the combat from the 2D Mortal Kombat games. A sound idea in theory, but in practice, the unforgiving platform sections and brutally difficult traps-- combined with sluggish controls--made it a chore to play. If you could look past those flaws, the game did have an interesting skill-tree system and live-action cinematics that rivaled the 1995 film in the cheese department.</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces hit the scene in 2000, and it had a rocky development. Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias and several other staff members left Midway before the game was finished, leading to content being cut and plans for Sonya Blade to feature as a playable character to be scrapped. The game isn't fondly remembered, but it's still an interesting part of Mortal Kombat history that Digital Eclipse is preserving for a new generation of players.</p><p>If you're looking to grab it, you can p<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-preorder-guide/1100-6533623/" data-ref-id="1100-6533623">reorder the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection right now</a>.
