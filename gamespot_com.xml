                <p>There are few things more important in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">all Hytale weapons</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_armor_in_Hytale">How to craft armor in Hytale</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165" data-ratio="0.53521126760563" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165"></a><figcaption>A character donning some rare armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg"></figure><p>If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><p>Before you rush into trying to craft armor, though, you'll need the right Workbench. All armor can be crafted at an Armorer's Workbench, but some higher-tier armor requires a tier two or tier three Armorer's Workbench. You can find out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">how build the Armorer's Workbench</a> and upgrade it to higher tiers in our previous guide.</p><h2 id="All_armor_crafting_recipes_in_Hytale">All armor crafting recipes in Hytale</h2><p>You can find every single crafting recipe for all types of armor in Hytale. We've broken up the armor by its category and then listed the crafting recipe for all armor pieces in that category.</p><p><strong>Helm </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Helm</strong> - 6x Copper Ingots, 2x Plant Fibers</li><li><strong>Iron Helm</strong> - 9x Iron Ingots, 4x Light Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Helm</strong> - 11x Thorium Ingots, 4x Medium Leathers, 4x Linen Scraps, 2x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Helm</strong> - 12x Cobalt Ingots, 4x Heavy Leathers, 4x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Helm</strong> - 15x Adamantite Ingots, 5x Heavy Leathers, 4x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Helm</strong> - 12x Mithril Ingots, 4x Storm Leathers, 40x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p><strong>Gauntlets</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Gauntlets</strong><b> </b>- 5x Copper Ingots, 1x Plant Fiber</li><li><b>Iron Gauntlets </b>- 7x Iron Ingots, 3x Light Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Gauntlets</strong> - 9x Thorium Ingots, 3x Medium Leathers, 3x Linen Scraps, 1x Venom Sac</li><li><strong>Cobalt Gauntlets</strong> - 8x Cobalt Ingots, 3x Heavy Leathers, 3x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Gauntlets</strong> - 12x Adamantite Ingot, 4x Heavy Leather, 3x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Gauntlets</strong> - 24x Mithril Ingots, 2x Storm Leathers, 20x Essences of the Void</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636164" data-ratio="0.53885400313972" data-width="2548" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636164"></a><figcaption>Some of the available armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636164-89042792f57a7eb39e9e73ee51916831.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Cuirass </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Copper Cuirass</strong> - 11x Copper Ingots, 4x Plant Fibers</li><li><strong>Iron Cuirass</strong> - 16x Iron Ingots, 7x Light Leathers, 6x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Cuirass</strong> - 11x Thorium Ingots, 4x Medium Leathers, 20x Thorium Ingots, 7x Medium Leathers, 7x Linen Scraps, 4x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Cuirass</strong> - 25x Cobalt Ingots, 7x Heavy Leathers, 7x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Cuirass</strong> - 28x Adamantite Ingots, 8x Heavy Leathers, 7x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Cuirass</strong> - 24x Mithril Ingots, 8x Storm Leathers, 80x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p><strong>Greaves</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cooper Greaves</strong> - 9x Copper Ingot, 3x Plant Fiber</li><li><strong>Iron Greaves</strong> - 13x Iron Ingots, 6x Light Leathers, 4x Linen Scraps</li><li><strong>Thorium Greaves</strong> - 15x Thorium Ingots, 6x Medium Leathers, 6x Linen Scraps, 3x Venom Sacs</li><li><strong>Cobalt Greaves</strong> - 18x Cobalt Ingots, 6x Heavy Leathers, 6x Shadoweave Scraps</li><li><strong>Adamantite Greaves</strong> - 22x Adamantite Ingots, 7x Heavy Leathers, 6x Cindercloth Scraps</li><li><strong>Mithril Greaves</strong> - 12x Mithril Ingots, 18x Mithril Ingots, 6x Storm Leathers, 60x Essences of the Void</li></ul><p>Hopefully, as time goes on, we'll see this armor system expanded in Hytale. Right now, it's essentially the same as the weapons system, as every weapon category has six options, as well. Perhaps future updates will start to include some of the ultra-rare armor and weapons that we can currently see and equip in Creative, but this is what we have available in Survival at the start of early access in Hytale.</p>

                <p>The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Activision Blizzard over claims that the mobile games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile engage in "misleading and aggressive practices."</p><p><a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The watchdog said</a> the games are structured in such a way to encourage people to "play more often, extend their gaming sessions, and take up promoted offers" through "the possible use of deceptive user-interface design."</p><p>"Examples include repeated prompts, both during and outside gameplay, urging users not to miss out on rewards--also through in-app messages and push notifications--as well as to purchase time-limited items before they become unavailable," the group said.</p><p>"These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers--including minors--leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved."</p><p>The group further claims that the parental controls in Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile default to options "that offer a lower level of protection for minors," including allowing in-game purchases, social features, and "unlimited play time."</p><p>The Italian Competition Authority also said it wants to look into how Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile go about collecting personal data. "It seems that consumers--including minors--are led to select all consent options, including consent to profiling for commercial purposes, in the belief that they are faced with a mandatory choice," the group said.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment. The company and its franchises are now owned by Microsoft following the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout.</p>
