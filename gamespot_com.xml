                <p>During today's Switch-focused Nintendo Direct livestream, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The trailer was a narrated deep dive with lots of gameplay detailing the new game. The game is still slated for 2025, but no new release date was given.</p><p>The trailer showed Samus exploring a jungle planet with a colossal tree at the center. She has to scan stone figures to make her way through the thick forest while dealing with hostile bug-like aliens. But she'll be helped along by new Psychic abilities, like telekinesis for puzzle-solving and making her way through doors. It seems as if some psychic force is helping her along, and at one point it calls her a "Chosen One." The trailer ends with a brief look at a slick new red and white suit.</p><p>The wait for Metroid Prime 4 has been excruciating for fans of the franchise. The game was first announced during E3 2017, but there was a prolonged period of radio silence after that initial announcement. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Development on the game was reportedly rebooted in 2019</a>, and Nintendo went silent for several years on the status of the next Metroid Prime adventure, filling the gap with Metroid Dread in 2021 and a remaster of the first Metroid Prime game in 2023.</p><p>2024 also saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/">trailer for Metroid Prime 4</a> released, but it was light on details at the time.

                <p>Backbone has revealed its new limited-edition controller for smartphones, and for fans of classic Xbox vibes, this could be a very nostalgic device for mobile gaming. The Backbone One: Xbox Edition controller will go on sale starting March 27 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET. Since this will be sold in limited quantities, it'll be available exclusively through the <a href="https://backbone.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone store</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/8067al4hlgeap?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17430825347459?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

It's a darker shade of green that references the classic aesthetic of Xbox, and it includes a black PCB and the iconic Xbox button. Beyond that, you're getting the standard range of inputs that you'll find on other Backbone controllers, allowing you to play games with a traditional selection of controls.</p><p>This is also a second-gen model, so you're getting a USB-C connection that can pair with your phone, even if it's protected by a phone case. This makes the Backbone controller quite appealing as you won't need to strip the protective cover off of your phone every time you want to use it. Additionally, there is passthrough charging, a 2.5mm headphone jack, and support for most iPhones and Android devices.</p><p>If you're looking to pair this with other devices, 8BitDo also launched a mechanical keyboard and mouse that are also equipped with transparent green shells. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox-inspired transparent green keyboard</a> is on sale for the first time since its release earlier this year and the matching <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro R8 Wireless Gaming Mouse is priced at $60</a>.</p><h2>Backbone One controllers</h2><p>In case it sells out, you can grab a Backbone controller for your phone in either a carbon-black color scheme inspired by the Xbox Series X console or a PlayStation white version. As mentioned above, the second-gen models feature USB-C connections, but if you're using an older iPhone, you can get a first-gen model equipped with a Lightning port.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, Black)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RL7VLKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>When it first released, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-controller-review/1100-6491699/" data-ref-id="1100-6491699">Backbone One review</a> praised the controller for being a "combination of solid hardware and smart app design" that has only gotten better with its second-generation update.

                <p>In the early '80s, the Commodore 64 was at the forefront of the home computer revolution. Now, retro publisher Ziggurat Interactive is bringing back a selection of the classic games from the C64 era in Cosmi: Forbidden Forests, which will also include a new remaster of Forbidden Forests.</p><p>1983's Forbidden Forest and its 1985 sequel, Beyond the Forbidden Forest, are both included in this compilation. But the primary attraction of Cosmi: Forbidden Forests is the modernized version of the title game that transforms the 2D art style into something that resembles a medieval tapestry. Players will have the option of toggling between the original style of Forbidden Forests and the new graphics and audio. A glimpse of the remaster is included in the announcement trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDu0WSdbhww" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nDu0WSdbhww" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The remaining games included in this retro release include Aztec Challenge, Caverns of Khafka, Seal, Delta Man, Chomp!, Chernobyl: Nuclear Power Plant Simulation, Spite &amp; Malice, and Navcom 6: The Persian Gulf Defense. These titles retain their C64 style graphics and gameplay, while adding features like the ability to rewind the action or create save states.</p><p>Comic-book veterans Ant Williams and Andy Lanning's Ideas &amp; Inks provided the compilation's new box art, and oversaw a collection of digital comics based on Forbidden Forests and Caverns of Khafka. This package also includes a digital gallery of the manuals that came with the games as well as their promotional art from the '80s.</p><p>Cosmi: Forbidden Forests will be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on May 27.</p>
