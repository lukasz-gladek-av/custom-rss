                <p>The modding community for Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive one, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/"> with Larian officially embracing mods</a>, the game has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/"> more players than ever</a>. However, how many mods for a single game is too many? Larian was looking through stats, and apparently, players with 100+ mods aren't that uncommon, but this poses a bit of a problem for gameplay, so the studio is putting its foot down for console players.</p><p>Larian announced that it is issuing a 100-mod limit to console players for the sake of gameplay to avoid any other possible disasters. In the statement, the studio broke down why it imposed the limit and what to do if you already have exceeded the limit.</p><p>"Unlike PC, consoles can only juggle so many files at once. The more mods you have installed, the quicker this file limit is reached. Now that some of you have been trying to play with more than 100 mods, you've been letting us know that you're experiencing slow loading times or even game crashes," the <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-29-now-live-console-only_127" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement read</a>. "While we recommend only installing the mods you know you'll definitely continue playing with, to [maximize] stability, we’re introducing a 100-mod limit for console platforms. This change comes in today's console-only hotfix that introduces the limit, and depending on how many mods you already have installed, you may see different messaging when you next load your game."</p><p>The statement continued explaining if you have more than 100 mods, you won't be able to play on a console for the time being, but cross-saves on PC and console should be fine. The statement warns players may have to disable a number of mods from their PC so they can access the cross-save. However, another update is coming to give players access to those saves.</p><p>"We'll be shipping another fix soon that will aim to give you the means to access console saves that are disabled after today's update," Larian continued. "However, it is important to note that mods can cause general instability, particularly on console, and depending on the mods you've had enabled on a save, you may run into issues when certain mods are disabled."</p>

                <p>Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-combat-evolved-review/1900-6076140/" data-ref-id="1900-6076140">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> debuted on the original Xbox in 2001, Steve Downes is the only actor to have voiced Master Chief in the video games that followed. Actress Jen Taylor has had the same longevity as Master Chief's AI companion, Cortana. However, according to Downes, he and Taylor were briefly replaced by other performers during the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-6399288/" data-ref-id="1900-6399288">Halo 4</a>.</p><p>Downes recently shared the story of his recasting on his YouTube channel. As the actor recalls, neither he nor Taylor were aware that 343 Industries--which took over the Halo franchise from Bungie--had already cast new performers for Master Chief and Cortana. According to Downes, testers complained about not feeling connected to the new voices for those iconic characters. But before Downes could return, he had to audition for the role he made famous.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuEJMOAzNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NfuEJMOAzNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Downes and Taylor have remained firmly in place ever since, and the latter even reprised her role as Cortana on the Halo TV series on Paramount+. In response to Downes' story, Generalkidd reposted a clip from a Halo 4 build that features noticeably different voices for Master Chief and Cortana. However, Generalkidd points out that this may have been a temp track and unrelated to Downes' account about the actors who were chosen to replace them.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Generalkidd/status/1860878001769939137" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I guess this has become a hot topic again. For those who are curious, in the Oct 11 2011 build of Halo 4, alternate voice actors for Chief and Cortana can be heard. It's possible these were just placeholders though and unrelated to what Steve Downes was talking about. <a href="https://t.co/uKHDXSoemG" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/uKHDXSoemG</a> <a href="https://t.co/IoOsWJ9XGu" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/IoOsWJ9XGu</a></p>  — Generalkidd (@Generalkidd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Generalkidd/status/1860878001769939137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-had-emotional-punch-because-it-underlined-quiet-tragedy/1100-6527741/" data-ref-id="1100-6527741">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-2-review/1900-6112628/" data-ref-id="1900-6112628">Halo 2</a> turned 20 as fans were finally able to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celebrate-halo-2s-20th-anniversary-by-playing-its-iconic-e3-2003-demo-very-soon/1100-6527568/" data-ref-id="1100-6527568">the game's E3 2003 demo</a>. 343 Industries also rebranded itself as Halo Studios, and announced that future <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">Halo titles will now be developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>. </p>

                <p>Activision has released the latest operator bundle for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and it's none other than a shark. The "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack," as it's called, allows players to morph into a menacing-looking shark, but that's not all.</p><p>The bundle (<a href="https://www.oneesports.gg/call-of-duty/shark-skin-tracer-pack-price-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via One Esports</a>) includes two weapon blueprints and a number of exclusive cosmetics. The operator skin is called "Bloke Biter," and it transforms the operator Carver into a scary shark with huge muscles. The weapon blueprints included in the bundle are themed around the ocean and water. There are additional water-themed cosmetics to help make it look like you escaped from the depths.</p><p>This DLC bundle costs 24,000 COD Points, which is about $20 USD. You can get a closer look at the "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack" in the video below.</p><p>The in-game Call of Duty shop is regularly updated with new bundles, and the shark operator isn't the only new arrival. Peter Stormare's character, The Replacer, is now available in the store as well, and he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-the-replacers-leaked-finishing-moves-are-some-of-cods-most-ridiculous-yet/1100-6527926/" data-ref-id="1100-6527926">some of the most ridiculous finishing moves we've ever seen in Call of Duty.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">the month's best-selling game in the US</a>, and is already the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, it's been reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the future of the mega-franchise.</a></p>
