                <p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> this week for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo showed off even more gameplay footage during a Treehouse Live event, and more information about the game has come to light.</p><p>Social media user BearUNLV clipped a segment from the broadcast that shows the Mario Kart World character-select screen. There are three rows of four characters on one page for a total of 12, with seven tabs shown at the bottom of the screen. If each tab has 12 characters, this suggests there are a whopping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">84 characters in Mario Kart World</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7488860529600285998?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8vEQLcI9xSV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subsequent video from IGN runs through</a> the characters and costumes, featuring 60 in all, including costume variants like Gondolier Luigi and Yakuta Peach. The IGN video features five tabs as opposed to seven tabs in the official Nintendo video.</p><p>For comparison, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Switch had 36 characters, including those featured in the base game and through DLC. It hasn't been explicitly confirmed as of yet if Mario Kart World does indeed have 84 characters; since we haven't seen the full roster, it's unknown. But Mario Kart World appears to be aiming to be a bigger Mario Kart game overall, so a larger character roster wouldn't be a surprise.</p><p>The new Mario Kart World video also suggests the game will have at least 28 tracks spread across seven Cups, along with 24 vehicles. Interestingly, it looks like Mario Kart World has fully formed vehicles; players seemingly no longer select individual parts to assemble a car.</p><p>One major lingering question that remains unanswered for Mario Kart World is if the game will have DLC characters and courses like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe did.</p><p>Another video from the event showed the stage DK Spaceport, which includes a segment at the end that recreates the classic 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong. As you can see in the video below, racers have to dodge barrels that a giant DK is tossing down at them right at the race's finish. With up to 24 players competing at a time--the most ever for the Mario Kart series--things may get pretty chaotic.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">At the end of the DK Spaceport stage in Mario Kart World, they've recreated the arcade classic. <br>A very cool ending to a track, especially when you have that many racers at once trying to dodge barrels. <a href="https://t.co/WSf0z52RO4" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WSf0z52RO4</a></p>  â€” Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Mario Kart World appears to be a larger-scale Mario Kart game with a price tag to follow--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">it will cost $80</a>.

<p dir="ltr">He said he thought the idea of having to pause the game and go to the home screen, find the right menu, make a chat room, and then return to the game (the way basically every other modern video game console does it) was "bothersome." That resulted in the idea of the C button.</p><p dir="ltr">"So we asked for a special button to be added while the hardware design was in progress," Ono said. "It was a very last-minute request, just before the controller molds were about to be made."</p><p dir="ltr">Ono said he thinks GameChat's ease of use, as well as the fact that the Switch 2 comes with a built-in microphone, will result in more players trying voice chat for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew a lot of players would eventually stop using this feature if it wasn't easy to understand, so we worked hard to ensure it could be used easily to play with friends and family without any fuss," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the interview, Ono described GameChat as one of the Switch 2's "defining features," and that its origins came from trying to capture the vibe of a "student lounge" where people can gather not just to play games but also hang out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until now, online play for Nintendo games has meant everyone coming together to play the same game," Ono said. "But more than anything, we wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">GameChat will technically require a Nintendo Online subscription to use, but can be accessed for free until March 2026, around nine months after the Switch 2 releases in June 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">In a previous developer interview, Nintendo said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-could-have-had-magnetic-joy-cons-like-switch-2/1100-6530577/" data-ref-id="1100-6530577">Switch 2's magnetic Joy-Con 2's were originally an idea for the first Switch</a>, but the idea was shelved following a meeting with late Nintendo President Satoru Iwata where he gave feedback on the prototype.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $450</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders, including a Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World, going live April 9</a>. Nintendo announced a number of new first-party games coming exclusively to Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bonanza</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-upgrades-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-revealed/1100-6530550/" data-ref-id="1100-6530550">Switch 2 versions of games like Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>

                <p>A single image of the main menu of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has emerged, and it looks more like an iteration than an evolution of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch/" data-ref-id="5005-124">Nintendo Switch's</a> menu.</p><p>To find this image, you need to look at the Nintendo webpage titled <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"About Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games."</a> Scroll down to the section on "How to purchase an upgrade pack," and the image showing people how to navigate to the Switch 2's eShop gives us our first look at the UI. At a glance, it's quite similar to the menu you see after hitting the home button on Nintendo Switch. There's a gallery of game art in the middle, from which Switch 2 games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> are presumably launched. Above, you can see the time of day, Wi-Fi connectivity, and battery charge remaining.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470505" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470505"></a><figcaption>This is the first official image of the Switch 2's main menu from Nintendo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg"></figure><p>At the bottom of the screen, players can see which Joy-Cons are connected and a row of icons. Some of these icons are very similar to those on Switch 1, specifically the Nintendo Switch Online, Album, Controllers, System Settings, and Sleep Mode ones. The Nintendo eShop icon has been redesigned to a darker shade of orange, and ones that could be for features like Virtual Game Cards, GameChat, and GameShare appear alongside it. There's also an unknown icon represented by a green sheet of paper. This could be a redesigned News icon or something else entirely.</p><p>While there are some small but notable icon changes, the Switch 2's main menu, for the most part, takes most of its cues from the home screen design on Switch 1. That means we might be unlucky when it comes to potentially getting improvements like game folders or more menu themes, but we'll have to wait and learn more from Nintendo before we'll know for sure.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 will release on June 5.
