                <p>The highly anticipated AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are now available--if you can find one in stock. Much like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-where-to-buy-new-nvidia-gpu/1100-6528684/" data-ref-id="1100-6528684">Nvidia's new 50-Series GPUs</a>, the Radeon 9070 is selling out fast at major retailers.

With impressive tech specs for the price, AMD's 9070 cards could be a popular choice for PC gamers looking for a mid-range GPU.</p><hr><h3>AMD Radeon RX 9070 Series Restock Tracker</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRRWCF9J,B0DS2QZC9P,B0DS2QG2KW,B0DRRMZDH6&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://howl.link/apyxaa4471l2b?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17412763624389?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=9070" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Newegg</a></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4454873-71rlbyxkupl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454873" data-ratio="0.559" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4454873-71rlbyxkupl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454873"></a><figcaption>AMD Radeon RX 9070</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4454873-71rlbyxkupl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>Powered by the new AMD RDNA 4 architecture, the GPUs support third-generation ray tracing and a variety of AMD-specific features designed to bolster mid-range performance. The new architecture is paired with AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators that aim to improve functionality outside of gaming. If you're a streamer or like to record gameplay, AMD says the upgraded display engine offers enhancements for creators.</p><p>The RX 9070 Series features 16GB GDDR6 memory, which is said to offer a 20% performance boost over the older RX 7900 GRE. The RX 9070 XT bumps that to a 40% performance increase. Other highlights include FSR 4 for upscaling, a Software Manager that ensures your cards are always running the latest drivers, and pricing that starts at $549 for the RX 9070 and $600 for the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>Prices are a bit higher than that, however, as companies like ASUS, Gigabyte, and PowerColor are selling their models for around $700. Despite the heftier prices, they’re still selling out remarkably fast. Amazon seems to be the last one holding on to inventory--here’s a quick look at what’s available at the time of writing.</p><h2>All AMD 9070 GPUs at Amazon</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRWCF9J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS TUF Radeon RX 970 OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $710</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QZC9P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $670</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QG2KW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 XT (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $730</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRMZDH6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $720</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for gear to pair with the new GPU, check out the <a href="https://howl.link/kb1lb0edfi9v4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17412765738662?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 8-Core Processor</a>. Released last year and often sold out, it’s currently available at Best Buy and even has a slight discount. For something a bit more robust, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9950X-32-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NNRBGP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 9 9950X 16-Core Processor</a> is discounted to $541.75 (was $649) at Amazon.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>'s Underlands are stunningly beautiful, but some areas are deceptively dangerous. Throughout the level you'll be faced with the challenge of piranha-infested water, and some of these aren't as easy to cross as they first seem.</p><p>The girls can shapeshift throughout this level. While Mio is safe in her "otter" form--which, if you ask us, looks much more like a lizard, Zoe isn't as lucky. If Zoe enters the water as a human, fairy, or tree, she will quickly become piranha food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958"></a><figcaption>Wall running can save Zoe from piranhas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png"></figure><p>Some of the safe methods forward aren't very obvious. During the first area of piranha waters there is a short platforming section until you end up stranded on a patch of grass. While Mio can swim through the water, she soon faces a roadblock where Zoe needs to give her some help to life a barrier. At this point, Zoe should wall run on the left-hand wall. Don't worry, we forgot wall running was a thing too.</p><p>If you're struggling to make the distance, try angling Zoe towards the middle of the wall, jump dashing to get as far along as possible, and then wall running before jump dashing to the next platform. From here, Zoe should shapeshift into the tree and use the areas on the wall to grapple from point to point until the next safe platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959"></a><figcaption>Use Zoe's tree form to grapple across water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg"></figure><p>After landing there, you'll see a large rock blocks the way. As the tree, Zoe can lift the rock to allow Mio to get through. Here, Mio should shift into the gorilla form to break the log. When she is in a safe space, Zoe should let go of the giant rock which will fly forward and break through the barrier.</p><p>After a short cutscene, the two need to forge forward once more. Complete the platforming section until you find yourself looking over a large ledge to a round pool of water. Zoe can turn into a fairy and fly across the water to the flower stream which will carry her across the water to safety. As her gorilla form, Mio should use the pink leaves to swing across to the water and then quickly shift into her otter form as she drops to the water. Here, she can safely swim through a gap in the rocks underwater.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960"></a><figcaption>Some sections require quick shapeshifting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg"></figure><p>The next piranha waters are shortly afterwards. Zoe will need to use the grapples on the left wall before quickly shifting into her fairy form to fly towards the flower streams that will carry her to safety. Mio can use the same grapples before turning into her otter form in midair and swimming to the next section.</p><p>After yet more platforming and a puzzle sequence, Zoe and Mio find more piranha-infested waters. Here, Mio will need to transport a large plant stalk that Zoe is clinging to in order to save her from the waters, as well as some new contenders: flesh-eating flowers. To begin, Zoe just needs to slide up and down the stalk to remain out of the flowers' reach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961"></a><figcaption>Another important wall running section</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg"></figure><p>When they reach the platform, Zoe needs to go on to it and turn into her tree form. By grappling the flower bud on the wall, she can make the flowers on the wall retract, meaning that Mio is free to transport the stalk through to the next section, and Zoe can transform into her fairy form to quickly fly through and rejoin the stalk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962"></a><figcaption>Not all stalks will float for long</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg"></figure><p>In the next area, Mio needs to drag the stalk close to the flowers on the right so that Zoe can grapple across them and attach to the second stalk that's already waiting there. This pole will quickly begin to sink in the water, so Mio needs to swim around and bring the first stalk with her for Zoe to attach to.</p><p>That's all of the piranha water sections in the Underlands and how to safely navigate them. Along the path forward on the right you'll find the next Split Fiction side story, so be sure to complete that before moving on.

                <p>The Kickstarter for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-ref-id="5000-620867">The Sinking City 2</a> has gone live, and Frogwares has shown off a sneak peek at the game with a deep dive into its current state of development. The studio says that it'll be using crowdfunding to help create a safety net for the developer, as well as use the funds to secure additional features for the game. Currently, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1741196058798550&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kZebdK01qp7eWnGCKfScR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frogwares is aiming to secure $105,000 in funding</a>, and similar to its previous Kickstarter campaign for Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, it'll offer various rewards to backers if certain goals are met.</p><p><span>This new campaign is launching during a dangerous time for the studio and Ukraine, as three years on, Russia's invasion of the country is still ongoing. "After three years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy," Frogwares CEO Wael Amr said in a press release.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0mNkrXHJc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we've decided to take the same route as before."</p><p>For The Sinking City 2, Frogwares says players can expect a "horror-first" approach, with the gameplay being built around pillars of combat and exploration. The game will feature a Lovecraftian influence once again, as players will venture into the decaying city of Arkham, scrounge for limited resources, and solve various cases inside of a morally grey world that features an expanded Cthulu mythos.</p><p>"We're not ditching our investigation roots entirely but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan added. "We've placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional."</p><p>It has been a long road for the sequel to 2019's The Sinking City, as several years back, Frogwares was involved in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nacon-fires-back-at-the-sinking-city-dev-over-games-sale-on-steam/1100-6488264/">infamous dispute with publisher Nacon</a> regarding ownership over the game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sinking-city-2-goes-from-mystery-to-full-horror-in-reveal-trailer/1100-6521650/">The Sinking City 2 was officially unveiled in March 2024</a>, and while it doesn't have a concrete release date yet, it will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">Some of the best features in the new update are described by developer NetEase as "optimizations." These optimizations include a visual improvement to Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward and a new voice-enhancement setting for in-game chat. But arguably the best optimization is the addition of a new feature that allows players to report other players who ditch matches before they're over. As of the latest patch, players can now report bad sports via the in-game menu while still in a match, which is a definite win for players who are tired of witnessing un-hero-like behavior and poor sportsmanship.</p><p dir="ltr">The new update also squashes some hero-based bugs. Players who are hit by Human Torch's Flaming Meteor ability will no longer find themselves trapped inside of walls, and Loki's UI no longer disappears when he takes on the form of other heroes. An issue with Loki's Regeneration Domains working incorrectly has also been resolved, and his sister Hela will no longer be haphazardly launched into the air after triggering her Goddess of Death ultimate ability.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the aforementioned new limited-time in-game activity--the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event--the game's developers haven't shared too many details on what the event itself will consist of. What we do know is that players who complete the event will be able to earn Black Widow's "Mrs. Barnes" series costume rewards, free of charge. Devs also shared that the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event will begin on Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET and end on Friday, April 11 at 1:59 AM PT / 4:59 AM ET. Players will likely need to complete a series of in-game challenges to unlock the cosmetic rewards, but given the lack of details in the patch notes, it's possible the event may consist of other activities as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The real star of the latest Marvel Rivals update is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-event-will-let-you-unleash-chaos-as-an-entire-team-of-cloned-heroes/1100-6529857/">new game mode called Clone Rumble</a>. Clone Rumble is exactly what it sounds like: A game mode that allows players to form a team consisting entirely of the same hero. It's looking like Clone Rumble is a limited-time mode, as NetEase included a Clone Rumble schedule in the patch notes. Clone Rumble mode will be available during the following dates and times:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET - Monday, March 10 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 14 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 17 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 21 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 24 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li></ul><p>Keep scrolling for a detailed look at the version 20250307 patch notes (which are listed in full below) or check them out via <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow ">the official Marvel Rivals website</a>.</p><h2>Patch Notes</h2><h3>Optimizations</h3><p>1. Improved the Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward.</p><p>2. Added a voice enhancement setting for the microphone.</p><p>3. You can now report those who leave matches prematurely via the menu while still in a match.</p><h3>Fixes</h3><h4>All Platforms</h4><h4>General</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where switching from a Proficiency Deluxe Avatar back to the standard Avatar required a re-login to take effect.</p><p>2. Resolved an issue where other players viewing a career profile would not immediately see the latest scores added after reaching maximum proficiency with a hero. A re-login was required for the changes to take effect.</p><p>3. Corrected the blocklist full notification, which mistakenly stated that the friends list was full.</p><h4>Maps and Modes</h4><p>1. Fixed several terrain issues that could cause characters to become stuck or clip into strange areas.</p><p>2. Resolved various problems with broken collisions, floating objects, etc.</p><p>3. Addressed multiple map sound effect issues.</p><h4>Heroes</h4><p>1. Loki's Disappearing Act: Fixed an issue where Loki's UI would vanish after he transformed. The God of Mischief can now keep his tricks visible!</p><p>2. Human Torch's Meteor Mishap: Resolved a glitch where the Human Torch's Flaming Meteor ability could sometimes trap hit enemies inside walls. Now, foes will feel the burn, not the barrier!</p><p>3. Persistent Pyro-Prison: Fixed an issue that the Human Torch's Pyro-Prison wouldn't promptly disappear upon his defeat. No more lingering flames!</p><p>4. Loki's Blessing Blunder: Fixed a problem where if Loki and his doppelganger placed Regeneration Domains that overlapped and Loki walked over the overlapped area, then back into his own Regeneration Domain, it would lose its healing effect. Now, the trickster can heal without a hitch!</p><p>5. Punisher's Missile Mayhem: Addressed a rare issue where the Punisher's Ultimate Ability would sometimes continue to detect enemies and fire missiles during network disruptions. The Punisher's firepower is now accurate, even in chaos!</p><p>6. Hela's Knockback Kinks: Resolved an inconsistency where Hela would sometimes be launched up after unleashing her Ultimate Ability. The Goddess of Death will now fly firm to rain destruction her foes!</p><p>7. Wolverine's Leap of Faith: Fixed a quirk where characters launched up by Wolverine's Ultimate Ability would sometimes exhibit exaggerated jumping abilities. The mutant's effect is now properly contained!</p><p>8. Jeff's Ice Surprise: Corrected a bug where when the Team-Up Ability is active, Jeff the Land Shark could launch Frozen Spitballs that exceed expectations via certain actions. The aquatic cutie's attacks are now as intended!</p><p>9. Hela's Vehicle Visibility: Fixed an issue where after Hela releases her Ultimate Ability, sometimes she may not be immediately detected when near the mission vehicle. Now her presence will be felt.</p><p>10. Adam's Ultimate Energy Fail: Resolved a problem where if Adam Warlock's Ultimate Ability failed in certain areas (like cliff edges), 50% energy wouldn't be returned. The hero's energy is now properly restored!</p><p>11. Peni Parker's Positioning Predicament: Fixed a positioning issue that could sometimes occur when Peni was hit by Namor's Ultimate Ability. The mech pilot is now perfectly aligned for battle!</p><h4>PC</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where some graphics cards couldn't enable Intel XeSS.</p><h4>Console</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where after modifying the mapping of the controller's L3 button, the chat window could not be opened on the results screen.</p><p>2. Resolved a rare issue on PlayStation where Wolverine's Rage Uncaged trophy sometimes wouldn't unlock.</p>

                <p>Sony is now allowing users in the UK and Japan to rent PS5, PlayStation VR 2, and PlayStation Portal devices. In the UK, Sony has partnered with leasing company Raylo for this, with plans covering 12-, 24-, and 36-month terms.</p><p>Plans start at £11/month for the PS5 digital slim model with a 36-month lease, and scale up from there for shorter lease durations. Leasing a PS5 Pro, meanwhile, starts at £19/month for 36 months, scaling up to £27/month for a 12-month lease. Sony also offers monthly rolling leases that allow players to cancel any time, but these are considerably more expensive (£36/month for the PS5 Pro).</p><p>This doesn't appear to be a rent-to-own program. The <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leasing website states</a> that, "Your lease ends when you return your device, after your chosen lease term."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4454856-screenshot2025-03-06at10.15.06am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454856" data-ratio="0.33333333333333" data-width="1122" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4454856-screenshot2025-03-06at10.15.06am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454856"></a><figcaption>Lease a PS5 in the UK.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4454856-screenshot2025-03-06at10.15.06am.png"></figure><p>People can also rent the PSVR 2 starting at £18.50/month for a 36-month lease, the PlayStation Portal for £6.50/month over 36 months, and a DualSense Edge controller for £7.50/month over 36 months.</p><p>Raylo offers a "fair wear and tear policy" that states users can return a device with "obvious signs of use," including deep scratches, small dents, and discoloration. However, cracks, significant cosmetic damage, and functional faults are outside of the policy and <a href="https://help.raylo.com/en/articles/3330261-our-repair-charge-grades-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">could result in charges.</a></p><p>If you're interested in leasing a PlayStation device with Raylo, you can <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit the leasing website to learn more and place an order.</a></p><p>A similar leasing program is available in Japan. It's proving to be very popular there, apparently, with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton reporting that rental allocation has already reached capacity.</a> As of yet, however, there is no word on if the rental program will come to the US.</p><p>Many years ago, Microsoft announced Xbox All Access, a program that allowed players in the US to buy an Xbox and pay for it on a monthly schedule similar to a smartphone plan. The service appears to have been discontinued or scaled back in the US but is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/xbox-all-access" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still available in New Zealand.</a></p><p>The PS5 Pro, priced at $700 USD, is among the most expensive video game consoles ever. It's not aimed at regular players, however, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-who-is-the-ps5-pro-for/1100-6526452/" data-ref-id="1100-6526452">Sony is instead targeting hardcore users who don't care very much about price.</a></p>

                <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra doesn't have an official release date or even window yet beyond "2025," but according to one of the game's voice actors, we could be playing it by the end of the year. </p><p>The game's Black Panther voice actor, Khary Payton, told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, "We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025. We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." While the game seemingly already had a 2025 release window, Payton's comment at least narrows down a potential launch month.</p>
