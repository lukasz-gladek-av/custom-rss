                <p>Gameplay footage of what appears to be Battlefield's new battle royale has surfaced online in an apparent leak, highlighting some features that could distinguish it from the competition.</p><p>About <a href="https://streamable.com/3slup3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">nine minutes of footage</a>, watermarked by a Bilibili user called Misaka_Mikoto_01, shows what looks like an early build of the Battlefield battle royale. The build could be from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-labs-testing-program-kicks-off-again-this-week-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6534336/" data-ref-id="1100-6534336">latest Battlefield Labs test</a>, which began late last week. The beginning of the video includes the loading screen and loadout menu before the player airdrops onto the battle royale's massive map.</p><p>The footage shows buildings and other geometric elements popping in. The player also swims in water and later takes out a sledgehammer to demolish the walls of a bathroom in classic Battlefield fashion. Each wall took about two sledgehammer swings before completely coming down. Grenades, ziplines, and a ladder gadget are also used in the leaked footage.</p><p>Publisher EA publicly confirmed this past summer that the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">getting a new battle royale</a>. Ripple Effect, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Portal mode and is one of the four studios under the Battlefield Studios banner, is developing the mode.</p><p>This won't be the first time that Battlefield has flirted with the battle royale format--2018's Battlefield V featured Firestorm, which had a max of 64 players. The closing ring was, as the name implies, a giant ring of fire, as opposed to the toxic gas in Call of Duty: Warzone or the storm in Fortnite.</p><p>Releasing during the initial boom of battle royale games, Firestorm didn't take off the same way Warzone, Fortnite, or Apex Legends did. Unlike Warzone, which was free to download separately from the main Call of Duty games, Firestorm required the purchase of Battlefield V.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-is-getting-a-new-battle-royale-mode-it-seems/1100-6533613/" data-ref-id="1100-6533613">teaser for Battlefield 6's yet-to-be-officially-named battle royale</a> features a wave of destructive fire, implying that the new mode is a return to Firestorm. Battlefield 6 wrapped up a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/many-battlefield-6-fans-played-beta-using-minimum-specs-says-ea/1100-6534385/" data-ref-id="1100-6534385">successful open beta</a> in August, and the full game is scheduled for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 10. Battlefield Studios has not clarified whether this upcoming battle royale is part of Battlefield 6 or if it will be standalone.</p><p><i><a href="https://shorturl.at/IWQxO" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Click here</a></i><i> to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games</p>
      </div>
<p>Drapeau left Haven weeks ago, and said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that they're joining WB Games Montreal as a creative director for an upcoming project. "Let's do this!" Drapeau said.</p><p>Drapeau is a video game industry veteran, having started back in 2006 in testing and internship positions with VMC and Odd1 before joining Ubisoft in 2007 as a game designer. Drapeau was later promoted to lead game designer on Rainbow Six Siege before leaving to join Eidos-Montreal in 2017 to work on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Drapeau re-joined Ubisoft in 2019 and worked at the company for two years before moving to Haven in 2021.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Drapeau is working on at WB Games Montreal, but the studio was said to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones game earlier this year.</a> The studio assisted Rocksteady with 2024's underperforming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and also made 2022's Gotham Knights.</p><p>As for Haven and Fairgame$, the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">now reportedly coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><h2><strong>What is Fairgame$ all about?</strong></h2><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," creative director Mathieu Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2>Trouble with Sony's live-service push</h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>In August 2024, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed. At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market. He joked, "That's one of the reasons they removed me."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Fairgame$, Sony is working on multiple other live-service games, including Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>--which is facing its own set of challenges and has been delayed indefinitely. Another game, codenamed Gummy Bears, which spun out from Bungie at SIE, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/report-playstation-gummy-bears-moba-live-service-pre-alpha-teamlfg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently crossed a milestone.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Following the failure of Concord, top boss Hermen Hulst said Sony put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">new structures in place to help ensure its live-service games come to market in better shape. </a></p><p dir="ltr">For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's live-service games</a>, check out the gallery below to get the latest on the status of all the projects in the works.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In July the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Online Safety Act</a> came into effect, requiring that any form of online services feature age verification checks if these services contain content that could be deemed "harmful to children." This law has affected a range of websites, including social media sites like X, as well as sites that contain adult, 18+ content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-require-age-verification-beginning-in-2026-for-the-uk/1100-6533499/">even Xbox will require age verification in the UK come next year</a>. Now, Valve has introduced its own age verification process that requires users in the UK to register a credit card to their account in order to view certain games.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed on a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow">Steam support page</a> titled Age Assurance Under the UK Online Safety Act, Valve explains, "In order to access Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs, you need to be logged into an active user account and explicitly opt-in through the account settings page. For UK users, this opt-in process requires age verification. Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account."</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it uses this process as Ofcom, the UK's regulatory and competition authority, has said that credit card checks are very effective forms of age verification due to the fact you must be 18 to obtain one. GameSpot can also confirm that a UK debit card will not work in place of a credit card--in the UK children as young as 11 can get a debit card, which is likely why this is not offered as an option.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the Steam support page doesn't specify what constintutes a "mature" game--GameSpot can also confirm that games with violent and occasionally sexual content like Baldur's Gate 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverence 2 are still viewable, as well as controversial titles like Postal 2. Games where sexual content is a main feature appears to differ from title to title.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam isn't the only digital game storefront that has put restrictions in place regarding the Online Safety Act. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5133739/our-update-on-the-uk-online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Itch.io has made it so that affected pages will be entirely unavailable in the UK</a> until it implements a third-party age verification process.</p>
