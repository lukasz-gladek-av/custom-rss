                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a>, the free-to-play MMORPG from Korean developer NCSOFT and publisher Amazon, is set to receive its first major content update on March 6 when its Wilds of Talandre expansion arrives. The update will overhaul some of the game's existing systems while additionally adding all new ones like Artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name of the expansion implies and as detailed in a <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the update will add the new zone of Talandre. There the game's story will continue as players progress their characters to the new level cap of 55, all the while participating in new world events and field dungeons.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIXmI-iiyew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIXmI-iiyew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are big changes coming to Throne and Liberty's endgame too, with the update set to introduce a new activity in the form of Solo Dungeons. These are intended as a way to ease players into more difficult endgame group content. Those looking for a true endgame challenge will be able to tackle new 3-Star difficulty dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of systems, Throne and Liberty's current Weapon Mastery mechanic will be getting revamped. Details are still light for now, but Amazon states that it will add "another layer of personalization" to progressing weapons, allowing players to alter or empower specific skills. Current Weapon Mastery levels will be converted into experience points in the new system.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Weapon Mastery changes, a new Artifact system is also being introduced. In what sounds similar to tier sets from other MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, acquiring sets of Artifact gear will activate bonuses by equipping two, four, and six pieces of the same set. Two pieces of each set consist of a Solar Stone and Lunar Stone, which grant an active skill and passive skill respectively. This new type of gear can only be acquired from Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region or from Nebula Island, a new time-restricted area that features hourly events and periodic field bosses.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-launches-to-big-concurrent-player-numbers-but-not-as-big-as-new-world-or-lost-ark/1100-6526849/" data-ref-id="1100-6526849">Throne and Liberty launched in October 2024 to big concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>, even if they were smaller compared to Amazon's previous MMO launches for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>. Though its player counts have been steadily declining, it still regularly ranks among the top 50 most-played games on Steam by player count. Its most recent significant update came in December, when Throne and Liberty added the <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/the-call-of-the-spear-release-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spear</a> as a new weapon.</p>

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> most famous pieces of cut content, the Karazhan Crypts, is finally playable today as dungeon. The new piece of endgame content is part of WoW's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery</a> servers. </p><p dir="ltr">WoW is filled with unused areas or places that were never fully fleshed out, and vanilla WoW's Karazhan Crypts are one of them. It's a dark, moody area below the tower of Karazhan (which itself wouldn't actually become a raid until the game's first expansion) in the original version of WoW that has long captured the imagination of players. Now, as part of a new content phase for WoW Classic's current seasonal servers, the Karazhan Crypts have been transformed into a five-man dungeon for players to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rLT6rP4L-Pc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by WoW Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WillIE</a> (in partnership with Blizzard), the dungeon itself is unlike others players may be used to. Inspired by classic dungeon-crawling RPGs, the Karazhan Crypts are shrouded in a darkness that can only be dispelled with a magical torch. There's no mini-map to rely on, so players will need to stick together as they explore the dark reaches of the crypt and encounter new horrors. In keeping with the "discovery" aspect of the season, players will want to keep an eye out for secrets inside the dungeon that may aid their adventuring party.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a dungeon designed for players who have already acquired some endgame gear, and the new loot found within the crypts will be comparable to gear earned from raids like Blackwing Lair and the Temple of Ahn' Qiraj. Because of how powerful the gear found in the dungeon is, the Karazhan Crypts will be on a 24-hour lockout, allowing players to run it once per day.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard originally teased the addition of the Karazhan Crypts back when Season of Discovery was first announced at BlizzCon 2023. However, it's not the first new dungeon added to vanilla WoW as part of the season. Blizzard previously added Demon Fall Canyon, another mostly unused area of the game's world, as a dungeon--one where players face off against the phantom of Grommash Hellscream himself.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new dungeon, Season of Discovery's new content phase additionally revamps its infamous Naxxramas raid. Blizzard is already teasing another new piece of endgame content as well in the form of what looks to be a Scarlet Crusade-themed raid, though players will have to wait for more details.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the modern version of WoW, its next big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">update will be focused on the goblins of Undermine</a>, all while Blizzard works on the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing feature</a> announced to be coming as part of the game's next expansion.</p>

                <p>Most of the early research into video games seemed to be designed to find a link between in-game violence and its effects on players in the real world. More recently, there have been studies about the adverse affects of gaming addiction. However, there's now research that suggests playing games may actually be beneficial for players, depending upon the type of the game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/VIDEO-GAMES/MENTAL-HEALTH/akpeewkqgpr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the majority of the research into the benefits of gaming focuses on cozy video games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/" data-ref-id="1900-6417431">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. These casual games are designed to be soothing to play and almost impossible to lose. That genre also avoids putting players into overly stressful situations.</p><p>Hiroyuki Egami, an assistant professor at Nihon University, published a study conducted in Japan between 2020-2022 which found that participants experienced greatly reduced stress and an increase in mental health if they spent one extra hour playing games each day. A separate study by McMaster University assistant professor Michael Wong compared the benefits of casual gaming to meditation.</p><p>"To our surprise, there really wasn't a difference between the two forms of interventions," explained Wong. "For blood pressure and heart rate, there was no statistically significant difference between playing a video game and engaging in meditation."</p><p>This is an area of study that still remains largely unexplored, but these results are encouraging for players who have touted the benefits of gaming for years.</p><p>Improved mental health for players isn't the only way games are creating positive change. Players have also come together to help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/awesome-games-done-quick-2025-raises-over-2-5-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation/1100-6528769/" data-ref-id="1100-6528769">Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 raise $2.5 million</a> for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year at the BAFTA Game Awards, a UK gaming charity called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-charity-specialeffect-will-receive-prestigious-bafta-special-award/1100-6522222/" data-ref-id="1100-6522222">SpecialEffect was given a special award</a> for its efforts to improve access to video games for people with physical disabilities. At its best, gaming can bring people together, and it's a side of the industry worth celebrating when given the chance.</p>

                <p>The Call of Duty series is an annual franchise, so it's expected that Microsoft's Activision division will launch a new Call of Duty this year, like it has every year since 2005. In fact, 2025 will mark 20 years in a row of Activision releasing a new Call of Duty game (the series debuted in 2003 but had no release in 2004).</p><p>It's still early days, and to be clear, Activision has not announced the new Call of Duty game that's expected to release in 2025. But there have been a handful of leaks and rumors about Call of Duty 2025, including a rumor that it's a sequel to Black Ops 2 set in the 2030s.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know, and what's been rumored, about the next Call of Duty.</p><h2>What is Call of Duty 2025?</h2><p>If <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>'s sources are correct, Call of Duty 2025 is a new Black Ops game, a sequel to 2012's Black Ops II--set in the early 2030s. 2024's Call of Duty game was also a Black Ops game--Black Ops 6--and this would mark the first time Black Ops games were released in back-to-back years. Specifically, Call of Duty 2025 is expected to pick up where Black Ops II left off--that game was set in 2025.</p><h2>When will Call of Duty 2025 be released?</h2><p>If Activision and Microsoft keep to the standard formula, fans can expect Call of Duty 2025 to launch in October or November 2025. It is likely to be announced at least a few months before that, with Activision almost assuredly using Call of Duty: Warzone to tease the next game, as it's done in the past.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 have a beta?</h2><p>Call of Duty 2025 is expected to have a pre-release multiplayer beta, as all recent entries in the series have. Now that Microsoft owns the franchise, fans can expect the beta to launch on all platforms at the same time, at least if the company sticks to the gameplan from Black Ops 6. Previously, Call of Duty betas were held first on PlayStation due to a co-marketing deal between Activision and Sony. The Black Ops 6 beta took place in August 2024, so it's reasonable to assume the Call of Duty 2025 beta could take place in August 2025.</p><h2>Preorder Call of Duty 2025</h2><p>While a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of the safest bets a person could make in the video game landscape, Call of Duty 2025 hasn't been announced yet and thus isn't available for preorder. If history serves as precedent, preorders for the game are likely to open around the time the game is officially announced.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, Activision has not released any official trailers for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 platforms</h2><p>Activision has not announced the next Call of Duty, but it's likely to show up for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-xbox-games-are-coming-to-switch-2/1100-6529052/" data-ref-id="1100-6529052">alluded to bringing games to Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but whether or not this will include the next Call of Duty is unknown.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 be on Game Pass?</h2><p>Microsoft put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass at launch, and it's expected the company will do the same for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Insider Gaming reported that Call of Duty 2025 is a Black Ops II sequel set in the early 2030s, picking up after the events of Black Ops II. The Black Ops storyline is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/get-ready-for-black-ops-6-with-this-explainer-of-the-story-so-far/2900-5855/" data-ref-id="2900-5855">full of twists and turns and wild political conspiracies</a>, and it's expected that the new Call of Duty would continue this trend if it is indeed a new Black Ops game.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1000948621" data-promo-id="0"

all major new releases, and this is expected to continue in 2025.</p><h2>Who's developing Call of Duty 2025?</h2><p>The Insider Gaming report that contained a number of apparent details on Call of Duty 2025 does not name a developer for the project. In any event, Call of Duty games are not developed by one team alone, as Activision historically recruits multiple internal and external development teams to assist with each new release.</p><h2>What else is new for Call of Duty in 2025?</h2><p>Call of Duty is much more than just one big new release each year. Activision also supports its battle royale game, Call of Duty: Warzone with a regular stream of new updates. In 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-is-finally-returning-to-verdansk-in-2025/1100-6526178/" data-ref-id="1100-6526178">Warzone is bringing back the OG Warzone map, Verdansk, later this year.</a> Beyond that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-patch-notes-detail-major-camo-and-weapon-changes/2900-6170/" data-ref-id="2900-6170">Black Ops 6 is getting a full suite of new maps and modes through its seasonal model</a>, while Call of Duty: Mobile and Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile are expected to continue to expand throughout 2025.</p>
