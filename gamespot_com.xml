                <p>It's been a little under a month since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> launched, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247" rel="nofollow ">having achieved one million copies sold within its first week</a>, no small feat for a game that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/">essentially made in a month</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/">Within that same week</a> it managed to climb past 102,000 concurrent players, and <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1942291995151720746" rel="nofollow ">as shared by co-developer Aggro Crab</a>, it brushed past that record once again. In the team's own words, "Where's the guy that said the game would be dead in a week?"</p><p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game reached an all-time peak of just under 114,500 players. For comparison, Content Warning, a game from other co-developer Landfall that sits within that slightly hard to define genre of comedy co-op games, achieved an all-time peak of a little over 204,000 when it was released. The big difference there is that Content Warning was free at launch, so Peak's accomplishment is nothing to be sniffed at.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230"></a><figcaption>Surviving with friends in PEAK.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last week, the game received a fresh update with a few bug fixes that was quickly reverted due to inviting in even more bugs missed in testing. Right now the main thing for both developers is prioritizing bug fixes and stability, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> from last month they did say that they are "looking into possible updates." No details on what that might include, and that did come with the caveat that you shouldn't expect new content right away.</p><p dir="ltr">For those of you that have missed out on Peak, the concept's pretty simple: You're a funny little guy who, along with a few friends, crashed on an island, the only hope of escape presenting itself in the form of a mountain you must climb. But, this is a game designed to make you laugh at your friends' misfortunes, so climbing said mountain isn't an easy task.</p><p dir="ltr">You can pick up Peak on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> now.</p>

                <p>In 2021, PUBG publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-developer-krafton-acquires-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds/1100-6497553/" data-ref-id="1100-6497553">Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds</a>, the studio behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/subnautica-review-a-water-wonderland/1900-6416847/" data-ref-id="1900-6416847">Subnautica</a>. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-officially-announced-with-four-player-co-op-coming-in-2025/1100-6527239/" data-ref-id="1100-6527239">Subnautica 2</a>, began development roughly a year later. But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill. Now, Cleveland has shared a message for fans about his ouster and where Subnautica 2 currently stands.</p><p>In an extended post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Cleveland wrote "the events of this week have been quite a shock" in addition to recapping the history of Unknown Worlds, which began with a Half-Life mod called Natural Selection. Krafton's announcement of Cleveland's departure suggested <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/subnautica-studio-leadership-gutted-by-krafton-which-outright-says-that-subnautica-2-needs-renewed-energy-and-momentum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that Subnautica 2 isn't ready for early access</a>, an assertion that the director denies.</p><p>"We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it," said Cleveland. "And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Kraftonâ€™s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists. That led to <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a response from Unknown Worlds</a> which asks players for patience and notes that most of Subnautica 2's developers remain with the project.</p>
