                <p>Last week, the typically indie digital-games storefront Itch.io deindexed a majority of not safe for work (NSFW) or adult content. Deindexing doesn't mean that the games are all no longer available, but it does mean you can no longer find them through searching on the site. This came after the organisation <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout</a> launched a campaign against both Itch.io and Steam demanding that payment processors prevent the sale of particular forms of content. Now, in an <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" rel="nofollow ">updated FAQ from Itch.io</a>, the storefront has shared that it's looking to work with other payment processors that do allow NSFW and adult content.</p><p dir="ltr">Explaining the timeline for these changes, Itch.io wrote, "The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal. There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the meantime, we are actively reaching out to other payment processors that are more willing to work with this kind of content. We have suspended the ability to pay with Stripe for 18+ content for the foreseeable future. Our immediate focus has been on content classification reviews and implementing stricter age-gating on the site."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded FAQ also explained why so many more games have been removed from Itch.io as opposed to Steam: "The difference in our responses stems from the difference in our platforms. Steam is a “closed” platform where every product page is approved before it appears on the store. Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"Itch.io is an open, “UGC” (User-Generated Content) platform. With over 2 million product pages, anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers. We could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."</p><p dir="ltr">Since the changes took place, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard have also been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" rel="nofollow ">inundated with emails and phone calls</a> in an effort to push back against the banning of adult content. The International Game Developers Association has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">released a statement condemning the move</a>.</p>

                <p>The next Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, arrives soon on August 14. Ahead of its release, Nintendo has uploaded a new gameplay trailer revealing more details and reminding players of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">upcoming Global Jam demo</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ls_NtQ0s8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ls_NtQ0s8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This will kick off on August 9 and runs through August 10, but the catch here is that you'll need an active Switch Online membership to access it. If you're interested, the demo will be available to download later today and the sessions will take place at the following times:</p><h2>Drag x Drive Global Jam playtest times</h2><h3>August 9</h3><ul><li>3 AM - 7 AM PT / 6 AM ET - 10 AM ET</li><li>5 PM - 9 PM PT / 8 PM ET - 12 AM ET</li></ul><h3>August 10</h3><ul><li>9 AM - 1 PM PT / 12 PM ET - 4 PM ET</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the new overview trailer also provided plenty of details on how to play Drag x Drive. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are used to control each wheel on the wheelchair via mouse controls, and you can swipe forward or backward to control your momentum and direction. While a table is probably best for using these controls, Nintendo added that "most" flat surfaces--like your legs--will do just fine in a pinch. I've also tried the mouse controls on my oblivious cat as he naps on my bed next to me, and his squishy body worked surprisingly well as an impromptu mousepad while creating art in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Drag x Drive is one of two big releases for the Switch 2 in August. An upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land launches on August 28, and it'll include a brand-new expansion alongside updated graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is also out in October, and Nintendo announced a new Direct livestream for July 31. The company says there'll be "roughly 25 minutes of information" on upcoming games to expect here, so it'll be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> gets a proper release-date confirmation.</p>

That included a pair of Ho-Oh and Luiga immersive art cards, except it appears that the art for the Ho-Oh card may have actually traced over some commissioned fan art from 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The artist behind the fan art Lanjiujiu <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644" rel="nofollow ">shared a comparison</a> between their art and the Pokemon TCG Pocket card, with the Ho-Oh looking nearly identical between them. In turn, The Pokemon Company has released a statement acknowledging the issue.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star)," the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> explains. "After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards. As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p dir="ltr">It also notes that a "broader investigation" is underway to make sure that there is no other plagiarised art in the game. The cards are still available to pull in-game, but as <a href="https://x.com/spragels/status/1950470860118380792" rel="nofollow ">shown by some users online</a>, instead of any art there is just text that reads "New Art Coming Soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Lanjiujui also <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" rel="nofollow ">released a statement</a> earlier today following The Pokemon Company's, thanking it for its "attentiveness and swift action in removing the image."</p>
