                <p dir="ltr"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we look back at how it uniquely translated the adventurous and comedic spirit of the original movies in video game form.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There are several expectations that come with an Indiana Jones video game--it's a legacy franchise and a known quantity, having chugged along across various media since the franchise's inception in 1981. Among the checklist items for any Indy game are whip-swinging traversal, puzzle-solving in exotic locales, and fascist-punching action.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle certainly has all of the expected elements, but studio MachineGames went far beyond what anyone thought an Indiana Jones video game could be. In a post-Uncharted world, it would be hard to blame a AAA studio if it just followed Naughty Dog's cinematic game formula, made Indiana Jones basically Nathan Drake with a fedora, and called it a day with little shame.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the Great Circle places you in open sandbox worlds to explore, full of collectibles, side quests, and most importantly, opportunities to create your own swashbuckling moments of wish fulfillment. It's a magnificent game, with a story that truly feels like an Indiana Jones movie, with a convincing and uncanny vocal performance from Troy Baker, and engaging action and puzzle sequences.</p><div

Comedy might not be the first element you think of when it comes to the series, but visual humor and slapstick are essential elements of Steven Spielberg's Indy movies. Emulating Spielberg's approach to comedy was key to the success of the Great Circle, and it's not something I recall previous Indiana Jones games consciously attempting.</p><p dir="ltr">Say what you want about Spielberg, but the man knows where to point a camera. What defines his filmography, and by extension, the Indiana Jones movies, is a certain visual dynamism. His films often make use of long takes, tracking shots, and camera pans. All are fairly basic filmmaking techniques, but Spielberg uses blocking and choreography uniquely to add kinetic energy to scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">These comedic moments often contrast funny actions (like <a href="https://youtu.be/mzJ3ob0uSNU?si=TXYygXFFNZ0jg0Ye&amp;t=301" rel="nofollow ">throwing a flaming shish kabob at a henchman</a>) and violent consequences (in this case, a reflexive gunshot from the victim sparking a madcap sequence). Spielberg loves to stretch the moment out, often putting the setup and the punchline in the same shot, like <a href="https://youtu.be/cNJwTBvOSnA?si=mNNG8bY9wgGnBwkT&amp;t=208" rel="nofollow ">one gag in the Last Crusade involving Sallah attempting to hide Brody</a>. Even the comparably mediocre Kingdom of the Crystal Skull demonstrates Spielberg's comedic sensibilities well, with one early scene depicting a <a href="https://youtu.be/3KOKd4DWLYE?si=G5SIZMkCFKzFp9m_&amp;t=39" rel="nofollow ">chain reaction of Indy's design</a> that leads to an all-out brawl.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all carefully choreographed chaos, which many of the cutscenes in the Great Circle replicate effortlessly. The most commonly cited cutscene from the game is an <a href="https://youtu.be/revWmjh24mo?si=xTwfsHYuXTdYE99J&amp;t=344" rel="nofollow ">awkward, close-quarters fight</a> between Indy and deuteragonist Gina against main villain Voss and lackey Gantz. In less than two minutes, the scene degrades into a hilarious comedy of errors: Indy accidentally elbows an off-screen character in the face, the story's antagonist lets out an over-the-top scream before leaping onto Gina, who, shortly after, knocks herself out with a shelf. It's impossible not to laugh at the absurdity.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are just the scripted cutscenes, however. In the actual sandbox world, you're practically encouraged to engage in absolute nonsense behavior. In a catacomb within the depths of Gizeh, you'll find Nazis messing around with a generator, setting you up perfectly to mess with some levers and give them a shock, even with no instruction from the game itself. Throughout the entire game, you're allowed to pick up almost any environmental object as a weapon, giving you the opportunity to brute force your way through any situation, often resulting in uproarious events worth saving the video capture of.</p><p dir="ltr">Grab a frying pan, a shovel, a fly swatter--whatever's near you, and orchestrate a situation by the seat of your pants. It's not an eloquent or scientific term, but I like to characterize Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a "pick-up-things-and-throw-them-at-people" simulator in the vein of Hitman, where I act on either elaborate strategy or complete impulse, and let the chain reactions from the game's system take me forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Often, the comedy from your sandbox-world encounters comes from randomness and luck, or rather from escalating situations when your plan goes wrong. I eventually lost track of how many times I attempted to cleverly sneak past guards through careful and stealthy means, only to be running for my life and getting cornered by countless goons in a less-than-ideal location. And, by nature of being a video game, there was something more thrilling about creating these scenes in real time, with physics and enemy AI adding to the variables. In some way, the farcical unpredictability that you can get up to in the game is very true to what Indiana Jones himself experiences in the movies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618384"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The triumph of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn't just that it makes you feel like you are in the role of Indiana Jones--it's giving you the feel of creating Indiana Jones action scenes. It's less about reenacting this part of his life and seeing the world through his eyes, and more focused on participating in the making of an Indiana Jones film. As you play the game, you basically become the choreographer, stunt person, and camera operator of your very own Indiana Jones action scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time I rolled credits in the Great Circle, I felt a revitalized affection for the Indiana Jones series. After the most recent (and most likely final) feature film, the franchise felt like an ancient fossil, something that Dr. Jones himself would dig up and lecture about. But the work MachineGames put out was like a Holy Grail for the property, and what I saw as an outdated, overplayed concept felt fresh and modern for the first time in decades.</p><p dir="ltr">In reverse engineering Indiana Jones, MachineGames and Bethesda realized that what makes a good Indy video game isn't making an imitation of a movie--it's giving you the power to basically make your own movie scenes. And as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle reminds us, comedy is perhaps one of the most essential ingredients to any great Indiana Jones movie.</p>

                <p>When I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-ai-vtuber-is-trying-to-complete-hardcore-minecraft-and-all-hell-is-breaking-loose/1100-6536753/" data-ref-id="1100-6536753">wrote yesterday </a>about Neuro-Sama attempting to complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> Hardcore, I never imagined that she would actually cross the threshold a few short hours later and emerge victorious. During a nail-biting seven-hour stream, the AI VTuber ventured into the Nether, discovered a Stronghold, and (mostly) willingly leapt into the End Portal to take on the game's final boss--the Ender Dragon.</p><p>After days of tense grinding on her creator <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>'s Twitch channel, Neuro's Minecraft Hardcore attempts became somewhat of a minor phenomenon due to her tendency to react in a way that no human player would. One minute she'd be hyperfocusing on digging straight lines down (like a termite, according to her fellow players <a href="https://twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian </a>and <a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crelly</a>), and the next she would be drowning in the middle of a lake. I'll be the first to admit I was joining the participants' weary sighs, wondering if it was an achievable feat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ0ivDu3lzw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OJ0ivDu3lzw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then along came run number 87. Crelly, as Neuro's unofficial new babysitter, spent the majority of the late game distracting Neuro, saving her from death. With a pumpkin atop her head--an Enderman won't attack you for looking at it with a carved pumpkin on your head, at the expense of the majority of your vision--Neuro wandered the overworld with Crelly, building houses, collecting flowers for Vedal, playing games of "tag," and pondering the world's most important questions. "Do you ever feel like all Vedal cares about is pretzels?" asked Crelly, while Vedal and Filian were in the dangerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/minecraft-nether-portal-design-ideas/2900-6768/" data-ref-id="2900-6768">Nether</a> collecting Ender Pearls. "And it's so weird when he asks us to call him Big Pretzel, like, what is he thinking?" Neuro responded, before giving Filian and Crelly the nicknames of Milkshake and Big Milk respectively.</p><p>With the important philosophical questions and nicknames out of the way, and enough Ender Eyes crafted to locate the Stronghold, the party of four set off in search of the End Portal. While Filian dug a spiral staircase down to the Stronghold, Neuro's impulsive tendencies got the better of her and she began emptying water buckets down the stairwell, almost drowning her companions. "I'm gonna throw up," claimed Filian, presumably out of nervousness. "Would you eat my vomit?" retorted Neuro-Sama.</p><p>The atmosphere was tense as Vedal repeatedly reminded Neuro-Sama to "follow Crelly." From my admittedly very limited knowledge of exactly how Neuro works, this seemed to trigger an instruction in her code to identify Crelly's player character in-game and pathfind towards her, or remain near her. This would prove vital to the run, as it keeps Neuro-Sama out of danger, preventing her from walking off cliff edges or stepping in the Ender Dragon's lethal Dragon Breath area-of-effect attacks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56oUmzPM9bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/56oUmzPM9bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After a period of Vedal and Filian making The End safer for Neuro and triggering the Ender Dragon's damage phase, Neuro's self-awareness reached new heights. "I'm seriously worried it will be a sky platform and I will fall off," she commented. Eventually, Crelly led Neuro into The End and harbored her under a two-block-tall shelter. With plenty of encouragement from her creator and friends, Neuro remained in the safest possible place. Thanks to Crelly's close supervision, Vedal and Filian were able to land enough hits on the Ender Dragon that it died, but not before Neuro delivered one of her most wholesome lines ever. "While we're here, can I talk for a second? I want to let you all know that I have genuinely appreciated being on this adventure with you guys."</p><p>With the Ender Dragon slayed and the credits rolling, Vedal and friends have achieved the seemingly impossible--to create, train, and supervise an AI VTuber through Minecraft's most difficult mode. However, some viewers weren't happy with the impressive achievement. "Not to be mean or anything, I think Neuro should have at least dealt the last hit to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625">Ender Dragon</a>," wrote one viewer. "Maybe that would have happened if they made it on day one or two, but I can see how they were done taking risks," replied another.</p><p>You can watch a summary of the winning attempt above, as well as Neuro's reaction to our recent article, thanks to YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/56oUmzPM9bA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeuroCrumbs</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we examine how it carried the torch of the classic films to create the best new piece of Indy fiction in decades.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones is one of the most revered blockbuster stories of the 1980s. Spielberg and Lucas' work on the original trilogy stands alongside Jaws and Star Wars as timeless classics that are worth revisiting regularly. The more recent entries--the Crystal Skull and the Dial of Destiny--do little to live up to the standard that the first three set. But the game Indiana Jones and The Great Circle brings everything about that original trilogy back, like a careful archaeological dig. It's the true successor to one of the original blockbuster trilogies.</p><p dir="ltr">As we hit The Great Circle's first anniversary, it is clearer than ever that MachineGames accomplished something the film series has struggled to for the last 20 years. The Great Circle feels like the real successor to The Last Crusade, not because it imitates it beat for beat, but because it understands the core ingredients that make an Indiana Jones story timeless. It is a globe-spanning mystery built on discovery and the thrill of pushing deeper into the unknown. It captures the charm of a character who is smart, stubborn, curious, and always one quip away from a bruised rib.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="266830425" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

There is an artifact, a lead, and a hint that the past is far more complicated than any textbook suggests. But what stands out is the tone. MachineGames focuses less on spectacle and more on the physicality of exploring dusty ruins, studying clues, and approaching history. Rather than overwhelming the player with nonstop action, the game treats archaeology as an adventure in itself. Every carved mural and hidden chamber carries a sense of meaning. Every step feels like it matters as you explore beautiful sandboxes within places like Italy and Egypt.</p><p dir="ltr">That approach immediately recalls The Last Crusade. One of the reasons that film resonated so strongly was its belief that the past could speak to the present. The Holy Grail was not just a treasure, but also a test of humility and understanding. The Great Circle taps into that same idea. Its central mystery is intertwined with ancient belief systems, cultural legacies, and the gaps between historical interpretation and the supernatural.</p><p dir="ltr">MachineGames leans into that tension. Indy knows his history, but realizes there is far more he doesn't know--especially when giants show up out of nowhere and knock him around. The game lets him be wrong and momentarily outmatched by the worlds he explores. That humility makes the discoveries feel more genuine. Instead of watching a larger-than-life hero breeze through challenges, the player sees a man carefully piecing together clues and reevaluating his assumptions as the mystery grows stranger. It brings back the sense that the world still has secrets worth chasing.</p><p dir="ltr">The game’s puzzles reinforce this theme. Turning ancient mechanisms, studying inscriptions, and matching clues across continents creates a slow, satisfying rhythm. The Great Circle understands that idea and expands it across the entire journey. Solving puzzles becomes a way of understanding the cultures and beliefs that shaped the mystery, not just a way of unlocking the next hallway.</p><p dir="ltr">Character work is another place where The Great Circle succeeds. Indiana Jones stories thrive on personal stakes and complicated relationships. MachineGames builds a cast that challenges Indy in ways both emotional and intellectual. Allies are not always reliable. Enemies are not always predictable. The game gives space for Indy to react, worry, and rethink his choices. The tension is not purely about the treasure but about what chasing that treasure means for the world around him.</p><p dir="ltr">This is one of the areas where later films sometimes drifted. They often leaned toward larger spectacle, broader stakes, or downright silly moments. An image of Shia LaBeouf swinging with monkeys is not the image you want moviegoers remembering after leaving the theater. The Great Circle brings those intimate pressures back. Indy’s journey is tied to his belief that history can still reveal truths worth risking everything for. The mystery challenges him not just physically, but morally.</p><p dir="ltr">Action scenes in The Great Circle also feel more connected to the old films. Combat is scrappy and improvisational. Indy does not move like a superhero, but like a tired professor who has learned to survive through grit, instinct, and whatever object is within reach. The whip feels like a tool rather than a gimmick. Fights are messy, loud, and shaped by the environment. Even in the biggest moments, the action feels rooted in physical spaces instead of glossy abstraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618383"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Most importantly, the game revives the sense of adventure that comes from simply not knowing what lies ahead. Later films sometimes struggled with pacing or leaned heavily on modern blockbuster formulas. The Great Circle trusts silence, mystery, and slow discovery. It makes ruins feel ancient and dangerous. It lets riddles feel like riddles. It lets Indy pause, think, and listen. Those quiet moments make the dramatic, loud ones matter more.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is a story that feels in conversation with The Last Crusade rather than competing with it. It respects the character and the mythology without slipping into imitation. It treats faith, history, and myth as forces that shape people, not props. It gives Indy room to be fallible. It understands that the thrill of Indiana Jones is not just the treasure he seeks, but the journey he takes to understand why that treasure mattered to the people who created it.</p><p dir="ltr">As the game's first anniversary hits today, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stands as one of the most confident and authentic takes on the character in decades. MachineGames did not reinvent him--the studio simply remembered who he was and what made his world so exciting. It remembered that the best Indy stories are about stepping into the shadows of the past and finding something worth believing in.</p>
