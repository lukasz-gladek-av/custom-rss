                <p>A single image of the main menu of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has emerged, and it looks more like an iteration than an evolution of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch/" data-ref-id="5005-124">Nintendo Switch's</a> menu.</p><p>To find this image, you need to look at the Nintendo webpage titled <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"About Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games."</a> Scroll down to the section on "How to purchase an upgrade pack," and the image showing people how to navigate to the Switch 2's eShop gives us our first look at the UI. At a glance, it's quite similar to the menu you see after hitting the home button on Nintendo Switch. There's a gallery of game art in the middle, from which Switch 2 games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> are presumably launched. Above, you can see the time of day, Wi-Fi connectivity, and battery charge remaining.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470505" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470505"></a><figcaption>This is the first official image of the Switch 2's main menu from Nintendo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4470505-switch2editions-eshop.jpg"></figure><p>At the bottom of the screen, players can see which Joy-Cons are connected and a row of icons. Some of these icons are very similar to those on Switch 1, specifically the Nintendo Switch Online, Album, Controllers, System Settings, and Sleep Mode ones. The Nintendo eShop icon has been redesigned to a darker shade of orange, and ones that could be for features like Virtual Game Cards, GameChat, and GameShare appear alongside it. There's also an unknown icon represented by a green sheet of paper. This could be a redesigned News icon or something else entirely.</p><p>While there are some small but notable icon changes, the Switch 2's main menu, for the most part, takes most of its cues from the home screen design on Switch 1. That means we might be unlucky when it comes to potentially getting improvements like game folders or more menu themes, but we'll have to wait and learn more from Nintendo before we'll know for sure.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 will release on June 5.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> debut answered a lot of questions surrounding the release date, price, and launch lineup, but there is still a lot left unanswered. One lingering question is whether the new system's magnetic Joy-Con controllers will be prone to the same stick-drift problem that was commonplace in the Switch 1 controllers, and Nintendo's answer didn't exactly put those concerns to rest.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A with several of Nintendo's senior hardware development staff, the panel was asked if the new Joy-Con and Pro controllers for the Switch 2 have solved the stick drift-problem. Nintendo technology and development general manager Tetsuya Sasaki briefly fielded the question.</p><p>"As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up, from scratch, and they've been designed to have bigger movement and also smoother movement," Sasaki said.</p><p>The answer does suggest that the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons have been improved, but the answer conspicuously didn't address the subject of the question: if the new controllers have resolved the stick-drift problem. Perhaps being redesigned from the ground up has resolved the issue, but Nintendo did not say so directly.</p><p>The new Joy-Cons are very different than the older ones in some key ways, though. They're larger, to fit the new size of the system, and they attach magnetically rather than through a sliding mechanism. They can also double as mice when turned on their side, which is used in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, the wheelchair basketball game Drag X Drive, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-is-paid-but-only-barely/1100-6530597/" data-ref-id="1100-6530597">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, among others.
