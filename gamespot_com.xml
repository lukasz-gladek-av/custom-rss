                <p>After several years of development, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/">God of War</a> TV series at Amazon is starting to gain momentum. This live-action adaptation of the iconic PlayStation IP won't be a remake of the games, but like other projects based on popular video game IP, you can expect it to cherry-pick the best elements from its source material and remix them into a new adventure.</p><p>At San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner Ronald D. Moore spoke about how Sony Santa Monica's 2018 God of War game is serving as the primary inspiration for the series. "This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore said to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collider</a>. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p>

<p>Moore added that God of War game director Cory Barlog is also actively involved with the series, and he referred to the developer as having an impressive and encyclopedic knowledge for all things God of War-related. "I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head," Moore said. "I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way--all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive."</p><p>God of War is just one of several video game adaptations under development at Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">and it could run for two seasons</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">A second season of Fallout</a> is on the way and it was recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Wolfenstein is also in the early stages</a> of being adapted for TV. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fallout-tv-show-writers-room-board-the-andromeda-for-mass-effect-show/1100-6533296/" data-ref-id="1100-6533296">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">Warhammer 40K TV series</a> are also in the works. As for God of War, the last game in the series was 2022's God of War Ragnarök, which brought the story of Kratos to a satisfying end.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-studios-next-game-reportedly-going-well-may-not-be-a-sci-fi-new-ip/1100-6533167/" data-ref-id="1100-6533167">on its next big project</a>, and similar to 2018's God of War, it sounds like the studio might be busy putting a fresh spin on a familiar IP.</p>

Notably, it's also the first time it will be playable publicly since 2019.

                <p>As announced yesterday during the Middle-earth: The Adventure Ahead panel at San Diego Comic Con, the survival crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" data-ref-id="5000-566000">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> is getting a brand new expansion. This new expansion, titled Durin's Folk, is very light on details though. It's currently slated for release in Q4, 2025, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/545615719765639778?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> explains that you'll "continue the fight to restore Moria with an expanded end-game story, exciting new game mechanics, plus many unrevealed secrets!"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR3nlac_v90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dR3nlac_v90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A small teaser trailer was also released, showing off a big empty hallway with a massive door being opened by a group of dwarves. Various characters speak over the trailer too, with one notably saying "Khazad-dum is the home of Durin's Folk." For some context, Khazad-dum is another name for Moria, so it sounds like this end-game focused expansion might actually be living up to the base game's subtitles. Durin is also one of the seven fathers of the dwarves, the original group of dwarves that founded the dwarven race, for any non-Lord of the Rings loreheads out there.</p><p dir="ltr">Return to Moria didn't receive an outstanding reception when it launched back in 2023, averaging a critics' score of 59 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/">Metacritic</a>, and a user score of 6.8. The game appears to be doing better on Steam these days, with a very positive rating across all of its reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is available to play now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<section><p>Bloober Team's follow-up to its successful remake looks to be similarly nerve-racking.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">After a few hours with Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, it became clear to me that the oft-derided developer had made something special, and the conversation about the studio was about to change. After a few hours with Bloober Team's next game, the sci-fi horror <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-647672">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, questions about the studio's capabilities are virtually an afterthought for me. I'm no longer wondering if the team can set and achieve lofty goals. Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">When I previously saw Cronos during a hands-off showing in June, I likened its "merge system" of combat encounters to Dead Space, only played almost in reverse. Rather than strategically "cut off their limbs," like the famous bloody wall scrawl once instructed Isaac Clarke to do, Cronos delivers its own desperate plea: "Don't let them merge!" Enemies can absorb their defeated comrades, creating towering monstrosities that may well combine multiple classes into something more threatening.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, if one of the stalking husks of biomass that has blade-like appendages merges with one of the others that spews toxic bile at you, well, now you've got yourself a third, worse thing, offering the most horrific of both worlds. Sometimes the stakes are heightened from the get-go, with no shortage of motionless husks lying around any momentary battlefield you might find yourself in, and it may cross your mind to first burn away those buffs with a flamethrower--and maybe with a nearby fuel recharger, you can even accomplish this at times.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463"></a><figcaption>By merging, enemies combine their strengths and become much more fearsome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the real tension of any encounter comes when you're trying to manage not just how you'll kill enemies, but where. With an area-of-effect blast of your flamethrower that shoots out toward the ground in a small circle, you can permanently burn the bodies and prevent them from merging into a still-active enemy. This left me constantly worrying about where defeated enemies would fall, forcing me to sometimes purposely evade, but not yet kill, the game's monsters, or "orphans."</p><p dir="ltr">Flamethrower fuel was extremely limited in my demo, so the best practice was to get a few of them to die almost on top of each other, then light them ablaze like a big sci-fi viking funeral. But that's easier said than done, so inevitably I'd be faced with the choice to kill an enemy outright, whether its place of death was advantageous to me or not...which would then feed this felled monster back into my path as I'd watch it merge with other monsters still pursuing me.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a really clever wrinkle that once more gives Bloober Team an exceptionally tense combat system to lean into. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, I wrote abou how I'd often make it out of a fight for my life and "observed my breathing return to normal, and felt my shoulders release their tension." Similar feelings defined my Cronos hands-on preview. Initially, I was quite proud of my smart combat decisions that did just what I was instructed to do: I wasn't letting them merge. However, as encounters became more complicated, <em>some</em> merging felt like an unfortunate inevitability. I couldn't be everywhere at once, and I didn't have enough fuel to burn away all the bodies, so I saw more than a few merged, ambulating nightmares, which always provided the healthy kind of stress and anxiety that horror games should offer.</p><p dir="ltr">With a gun that slowly charges to fire off its most powerful shots, ammo scarcity went beyond just the fuel, too. I could quickly fire off multiple, weaker rounds, using up more ammo, or I could try to nail more powerful single shots, but they were sometimes very difficult to land on target, and the enemies would charge toward me in the meantime, of course. Combined with the merging enemies, this created combat encounters that demanded I constantly consider my moment-to-moment choices. Lining up shots on one particular boss' weak points was difficult enough, and supplies were low enough, that it took me about four or five tries to finally kill the thing. Since my demo started from the game's opening, I understood this to be the first boss of the game. Future bosses are not likely going to be more forgiving, I assume.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464"></a><figcaption>The slimy world of Cronos sets the stage for a time-travel horror story I'm eager to see for myself.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With gunplay and exploration taking plenty of cues from the genre's long history, I now find myself a few months out from Cronos' launch without much to worry about when it comes to gameplay. Upgrading my suit and weapons provided hard-fought and welcome buffs, I was constantly rewarded for going off the main path--like when I rescued a cat tied to a side quest that tasks you with saving many of them over the course of the story--and I especially loved the downbeat vibes of safe rooms, made whole with their own theme song like one of Capcom's finest.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still so much more to see before I know how the whole experience comes together. Bloober Team says the game will take about 16 hours to beat on a typical playthrough--more if you plan to see everything it offers. Cronos comes from a team of people within Bloober Team that is different from those responsible for Silent Hill 2. Naturally, the Silent Hill 2 remake enjoyed the blueprint of Team Silent's effort, so Cronos is the studio's chance to show it can do it all on its own. For now, at least, it seems the studio has found a way to make combat compelling and put its own original spin on the horror genre.</p>
