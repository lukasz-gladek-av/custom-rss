                <p>Bungie's new game, Marathon, will launch in March 2026, priced at $40 USD. The game's release timing and price were two of the biggest unanswered questions about the game, with many speculating that Marathon could be a free game. But Bungie has chosen $40, the same price as Arc Raiders.</p><p>Buying Marathon provides "full access to the game," along with its free updates, including new maps, Runner shells, events, and other content. Season 1 will introduce UESC Marathon's Cryo Archive.</p><p>"We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out--so Marathon's Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able purchase and unlock prior Passes," Bungie said, modeling what other games, like Halo Infinite, have done with their own battle passes.</p><p>Bungie also stressed that Marathon will not be pay-to-win with its microtransactions. "Most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

                <p>Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.</p><p>This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2000419616485736876" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posters that have been spotted in the wild</a>, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword.</p><p>We have no further details about the collab, which has only been <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2000189160892911930" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased by Epic</a> rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.</p><p>With Winterfest, which begins Thursday, annually offering two or more free skins to all players, it's possible one of the Bleach skins will be free. There haven't been any real rumors about what the free Winterfest skins will be, but with collabs with Harry Potter, Home Alone, and South Park also expected soon, plus leaks about new winter-themed versions of Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter, there are too many possibilities to make an educated guess.</p><p>Bleach will be Fortnite's fourth new anime collab for 2025, after Kaiju No. 9 in January, Cowboy Bebop in February, and One-Punch Man in August. We also got a wave of Jujutsu Kaisen villains in February.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer Vedinad has released the Spooky update for Megabonk, bringing a new map, character, and bosses. The patch notes also point to a laundry list of bug fixes and balancing adjustments.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spooky update was initially "going to be a small Halloween update," according to Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340/view/523110495538905880?l=english" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. That checks out, per the free DLC's name, but the developer added the desire "to make it a bit bigger." As such, the update is arriving for the festive season, with the Megabonk account <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/2000274122127897019" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> promising a "new meta."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Megabonk launched in September, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-vampire-survivors/2900-7118/">sharing similarities with Vampire Survivors</a> and Risk of Rain. It's a roguelike game where you do your best to survive against an onslaught of enemies on randomized maps. While doing so, you level up and find various items.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Vedinad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/megabonk-just-withdrew-itself-from-the-game-awards/1100-6536330/#comments-block-33642446">withdrew Megabonk's nomination from The Game Awards</a> for Best Debut Indie Game. The developer stated that it had "made games in the past under different studio names," so Megabonk's inclusion didn't "feel right."</p><p dir="ltr">Only available on PC, Megabonk has seemingly been a pretty big success. The game sports an Overwhelmingly Positive user-review label <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> and peaked at over 117,000 concurrent players in October, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3405340/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. Megabonk usually costs $10 but is on sale for $8 until December 17.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the Spooky update are below:</p><h3>New Content</h3><ul><li>New Map</li><li>New Character</li><li>New Weapon</li><li>New Items</li><li>New Enemies and Bosses</li><li>New Achievements and challenges</li></ul><h3>Game</h3><ul><li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li></ul><h3>Bugs</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li><li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li><li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li><li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li><li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li><li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li></ul><h3>Settings</h3><ul><li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li><li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li><li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li><li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li><li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li><li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li><li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li></ul><h3>Balancing</h3><ul><li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li><li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li><li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li><li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.</li><li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%</li><li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li><li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li><li>Dragon's Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation.

                <p>Last month, Matthew McConaughey became one of the most prominent actors to endorse artificial intelligence by signing a deal with AI company ElvenLabs that will allow it to utilize his voice. McConaughey is also lending his voice to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-612193">Exodus</a>, an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game.</p><p>"Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us," Robertson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EXODUS Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.</p><p>"So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games," said Robertson. "And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p><p>Exodus was originally announced at he title at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-announced-a-new-time-bending-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-veterans/1100-6519782/" data-ref-id="1100-6519782">2023's The Game Awards</a>, and it casts players as The Traveler, a character who is tasked with dangerous missions in space to steal technology and weapons from an alien race called the Celestials. McConaughey is lending his voice to a character called C.C. Orlev, but more information about his role is being held back for now.</p><p>A previous trailer for Exodus revealed some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-gets-a-new-trailer-featuring-cosmic-horrors-and-matthew-mcconaughey/1100-6527187/" data-ref-id="1100-6527187">the horrifying Celestials</a> that the Traveler will encounter. The game also plays with time dilation, as events in space or on an alien world can take place in days and hours while decades pass on Earth--a similar narrative thread used in the McConaughey-starring film Interstellar.</p><p>Exodus is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but it doesn't currently have a release date.</p>
