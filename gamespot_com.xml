                <p>Epic Games apparently <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1948486101020143845" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed passive XP gains</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of its Summer Road Trip event that will award a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-free-chevrolet-corvette-in-fortnite-and-rocket-league/1100-6533356/" data-ref-id="1100-6533356">free Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car</a> body for gaining XP to complete a series of daily quests. Playing Battle Royale had awarded 550 XP per minute, or a little less than half a level per hour, just for existing in the game mode--but that's no longer the case.</p><p>While this certainly is a bit of a nerf, it's actually not typical for Battle Royale and Zero Build to give passive XP. In fact, passive XP was only just added to those modes at the beginning of the current season--before then, we lived without it. The change had made leveling the battle pass this season meaningfully faster.</p><p>Assuming the change will stick for a while, there are two fairly obvious potential reasons for the change. The Summer Road Trip event is one of them, since its quests simply require gaining XP to complete. You only need to gain eight total levels across these quests, so the lack of passive XP in BR probably won't slow anyone down very much. Another possibility is that we're approaching the end of Chapter 6 Season 4, and this change will make it a little tougher for folks who are just now getting started on the battle pass to catch up before the season ends on August 7.</p><p>When Chapter 6 Season 3 ends on August 7, it'll also mark the end of the current seasons of Fortnite OG and Lego Fortnite. In other words, it'll be a pretty eventful season launch. In fact, there's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">an end-of-season event</a> ahead. </p>

                <p>It seems horror fans are destined to mourn the loss of Kojima's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> project until the end of time--but that doesn't mean there aren't games out there picking up the torch left behind by its playable teaser, aptly named P.T. Indeed, developer Broken Bird Games has absorbed some of Kojima's vision to craft the eerie mind-bender <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luto/" data-ref-id="5000-526997">Luto</a>. In this atmospheric horror title, you'll spend your time as a character stuck in a loop within their home, trying desperately to figure out, well, <em>why</em>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out this chilling mystery but want to know what kind of time investment you're in for before you do, we'll fill you in on how long it takes to beat Luto and how many chapters stand between you and the finale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mBgdXyIGsQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1mBgdXyIGsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How long does it take to beat Luto?</h2><p>How long it takes you to finish Luto will depend largely on your puzzle-solving abilities and how well you pay attention to your surroundings. Even with its occasionally obtuse puzzles, Luto is still a relatively brief horror experience that is focused on giving you a meaningful dose of the creeps without wearing its gimmicks too thin. With this in mind, you can expect it to take between <strong>3-5 hours to finish the campaign</strong>. Of course, if you're using a guide to assist with puzzles in Luto, you can almost certainly wrap things up even quicker. </p><h2>Luto chapter list</h2><p>Glancing at the chapter list for Luto may be confusing, with its repeated chapters and strange jumps. But it all makes sense within the bizarre, looping narrative structure of the game, which unravels to great effect as you move deeper and deeper into its twisted tale. While we don't want to ruin anything here about the way the narrative plays out in Luto, you can get a basic idea of what type of experience you're getting yourself into by surveying the chapter list below.</p><ul><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again</li><li>Chapter 2 - Beyond the Noise</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time</li><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again </li><li>Chapter 4 - Thanks for Pushing Me</li><li>Chapter 5 - Playing with the Truth</li><li>Chapter 22 - A Mouth Full of Sand Can't Scream</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time </li></ul><p>Luto is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

Today, during Robert Kirkman's panel at San Diego Comic-Con, the Invincible creator announced another new fighter for the game, and this one is a little more beastly.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Beast--the fearsome warrior who travels the Invincible universe looking for a fighter to give him a glorious death--is the latest entrant into the Invincible Vs roster. The reveal trailer for the giant showed off some of his smashing moveset--including one attack where he smashed his club into Bulletproof so hard, it knocked off his head and limbs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS - Battle Beast Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Battle Beast becomes the sixth confirmed fighter for Invincible Vs., joining the previously mentioned Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode, as well as the Viltrumite Thula. Two other Viltrumites, Lucen and Omni-Man, did feature in the game's initial reveal trailer in June, but neither have been officially confirmed as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. was announced during the Xbox Showcase in early June, with Skybound also announcing the creation of its development studio Quarter Up. Quarter Up is made up of industry veterans from Activision, Riot Games, Xbox, and more, and it was founded by Mike Willette, who previously worked on the Killer Instinct 2013 reboot for Xbox--as a developer and as the voice of the announcer.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

Surprisingly, we aren't talking about the HBO adaptation here. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts</a> is a hardbound omnibus containing the scripts for the Naughty Dog video games. Publication is slated for December 16, making it a well-timed gift idea for fans of The Last of Us.</p><p>The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is available to preorder for $66.63 (was $70) at Amazon. You won't be charged for your order until it ships, and Amazon will automatically apply any additional discounts it offers before launch to your preorder.</p><div title="[Various] The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3962" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts (Hardcover)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$66.63 (was $70) | Releases December 16</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The 616-page hardcover book contains the complete scripts for The Last of Us (2013), The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014), and The Last of Us Part II (2020).</p><p>The first game and the Left Behind DLC were written by Neil Druckmann, Naughty Dog's current creative lead and president. The sequel was co-written by Druckmann and Halley Gross. The duo, alongside Craig Mazin, most recently penned the scripts for the final two episodes of The Last of Us Season 2 for HBO.</p><p>This will probably be a fascinating book to pore over and have by your side during your next playthrough. But it might be of even greater interest to aspiring game writers. Scripts, like many areas of game development, aren't talked about by developers or publishers. Unless you work in the industry, chances are you've never had access to a script for a AAA game until now.</p></div>                      </div><p>The fact that this book exists at all is honestly pretty remarkable--unprecedented, even. We couldn't find a single other full video game script in book format. The closest published example we thought of was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skyrim-Library-Volumes-III-Box/dp/1783293233?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Skyrim Library</a>, a three-volume series compiling all of the written lore found in The Elder Scrolls V.</p><p>The reality is that many AAA games simply wouldn't make sense to release in book format from a financial perspective. Games with choice-based dialogue trees, branching paths, open worlds, and hundreds of NPCs, and enormous lists of side content would simply require far too many pages across multiple books.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us series for PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png"></figure><p>The Last of Us, on the other hand, sets up particularly well for this format. No other game has been described as cinematic or referred to as an "interactive movie" as frequently as The Last of Us. Heck, many of the scenes in HBO's adaptation are pulled straight from the game, no interpretation required.</p><hr><p>The Last of Us doesn't have choice-based dialogue, branching paths, or a sprawling open world to explore. The gameplay experience in the first game is essentially scripted. The sequel is more dynamic, granting players more freedom to approach combat encounters and puzzles in different ways. But much like Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, the "open" set pieces are still fundamentally linear.</p><p>This doesn't mean that the scripts will read just like a screenplay or teleplay. There are still lots of interactive components to the worlds of each game that will naturally be found amidst conversations between Joel and Ellie. All of the text that fills the space between lines of dialogue should be illuminating. Chances are fans will glean new insights from the text.</p><p>Screenplays, which are typically 90-120 pages, aren't published nearly as often as they once were, but occasionally we see teleplay collections for popular TV shows. HBO's The Last of Us adaptation isn't one of them--at least not yet--but HBO has recent experience publishing scriptbooks for its shows.
