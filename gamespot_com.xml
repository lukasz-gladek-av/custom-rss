                <p>Xbox developer Rare, which today is best known for Sea of Thieves, has commented on the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft that led to the cancellation of the studio's long-in-development project Everwild.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCzbo9xxo4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves developer update video for July</a>, Rare production director Drew Stevens started off by addressing the layoffs. "It would be strange to jump straight into our usual updates without acknowledging the news that we've ended development on Everwild here at Rare," Stevens said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/another-xbox-studio-reacts-to-the-layoffs-exploding-around-it-with-rares-everwild-dead-sea-of-thieves-dev-says-its-impossible-for-something-like-this-not-to-ripple-through-the-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>The game was formally revealed all the way back in November 2019, but beyond a trailer for it in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-was-missing-all-these-major-games/2900-6657/">updates on it have been almost non-existent</a>. Sources said Rare was unable to find the right direction for Everwild, and now it's no longer in development.</p><p>The cancellation of Everwild didn't "directly impact" Sea of Thieves, Stevens added, mentioning that development is continuing as planned. "Our focus as a team and a studio is on supporting our friends and colleagues whose roles are at risk," Stevens said.</p><p>The developer went on to say that it's "impossible for something like this not to ripple through the studio and affect all of us in some way or another, so please bear with us."</p><p>"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's reached out to check in on us and share their kind words of support. Genuinely, thank you, it really means a lot," Stevens said.</p><p>It wasn't just Everwild that got canned as part of the Xbox cutbacks, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">also canceled</a> a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, as well as the new Perfect Dark. Microsoft also laid off numerous developers across its network of studios.</p><p>The cuts came as part of a wider downsizing effort at Microsoft that affected more than 9,000 people and against the backdrop of Microsoft investing billions into artificial intelligence projects. Some of the laid-off developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King say <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they are set to be replaced by AI systems they helped create.</a></p>

                <p>Players anticipating the co-op horror shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-599968">Killing Floor 3</a> are a little concerned about the state of the game ahead of its launch on July 24, as a recent play test a little over a week before launch required players sign a five-year non-disclosure agreement in order to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">The stress test occurred on Sunday during two, two-hour sessions, during which players could request access through Steam. However, the fine-print of an NDA required in order to play raised some eyebrows. As revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/1lyxr4w/a_5_year_nda_for_2_hours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, in addition to agreeing to not take screenshots or record gameplay of developer Tripwire Interactive's upcoming shooter, players had to agree to not discuss the test for five years.</p><p dir="ltr">While NDAs are not unusual when playing early builds of games, the fact that the test required one when the full game is slated to launch close to a week later caught many players by surprise. It's possible the five years-distinction was legal verbiage copied and pasted from previous, older playtests, but it still doesn't inspire confidence.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-delayed-post-launch-update-to-undo-a-controversial-change/1100-6529977/" data-ref-id="1100-6529977">Killing Floor 3 was originally supposed to arrive earlier this year</a> on March 25, but was delayed just a few weeks before release. The requiring of a lengthy NDA for a playtest so close to launch has fans worried another delay could be on the way, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190?emclan=103582791474057313&amp;emgid=496075125142061061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about the stress test, Tripwire said it has been focused on optimizations and enacting player feedback so it can "ship a great game to fans on July 24."</p><p dir="ltr">"This test is designed to help our team and partners ensure that the multiplayer environment stays as stable as possible at launch," Tripwire states.</p><p dir="ltr">Tripwire has already laid out some of its post-launch plans for Killing Floor 3, which include improved animations, the ability for playable characters to be able to pick any perk, and the implementation of text chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 supports six-player co-op and features cross-play across platforms. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/" data-ref-id="1100-6529407">hands-on preview, we said Killing Floor 3</a> "paints a terrific first impression" and "looks like a killer co-op package," though only "time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> next major update is coming August 5, and now Blizzard has revealed two surprise quality-of-life changes that will arrive alongside the new content and season--a bank overhaul and a major update to Valorstones.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced in a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/player-character-bank-updates/2132208" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, banks are getting a significant facelift. For as long as Blizzard's MMORPG has existed (that is, over 20 years), players have had to purchase additional bag bank slots and then place bags within them to get more storage. That will no longer be the case come update 11.2, which will replace bag slots with purchasable storage tabs more similar to stash tabs from Blizzard's Diablo series.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will additionally remove the reagent bank and Void Storage, two bank-adjacent storage options that were more restrictive. While some players were initially concerned they might be losing storage space when hearing that news, as broken down in a post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1m06ypv/read_this_if_youre_concernedconfused_about_the/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user SpartanG01</a> (and highlighted by <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>), the new bank system seems to be a straight upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">Purchasing bank tabs is cheaper than buying bag slots and users are overall gaining an additional 50 slots without any of the restrictions previously associated with Void Storage or the reagent bank. Any bank tab can now be a reagent tab if one chooses, but with the added benefit of not having to use it exclusively for reagents. It's also less confusing, as all banking can now be done with one system as opposed to also using void storage, which was accessed via a completely different NPC and only for certain items. Funnily enough, this new bank overhaul that removes Void Storage is the first major change to item banking since the addition of Void Storage back in 2011 as part of WoW's Cataclysm expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't the only surprise Blizzard had in store. Blizzard also unceremoniously announced in the game's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/ghosts-of-k%E2%80%99aresh-development-notes/2119874/10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">11.2 public-test-realm patch notes</a> that WoW's main gear upgrade currencies, Valorstones, will no longer reset between seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate on the change in philosophy, but it's a huge change, as previously at the start of each new season players would need to grind Valorstones in order to start upgrading their gear. With this change, players can now stock up on Valorstones ahead of time without having to worry about them being erased in a few months, allowing players to more easily prepare for future updates.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's a great change that will allow players to get a headstart on gear upgrades, it appears Valorstones are still capped at 2,000, meaning players can only stockpile so much. Maybe that will change in the future, but for now, Blizzard is at least making Valorstones a non-seasonal currency.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will take players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop the Void Lord Dimensius. In addition to new content and the quality-of-life features outlined above, the update will also finally add a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-getting-a-new-highly-requested-emote-for-the-first-time-in-17-years/1100-6532592/" data-ref-id="1100-6532592">highly-requested emote</a>. Meanwhile, Blizzard continues to share more information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">WoW's upcoming housing system</a> and is gearing up to fully reveal the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">next expansion, Midnight, at Gamescom</a> in August.</p>

                <p>A collection of Mario games received a surprise patch, but it mostly serves as a rude reminder that Nintendo stopped selling it over four years ago. The version 1.1.3 software update for Super Mario 3D All-Stars is specifically for its performance on Nintendo Switch 2, with the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/50552/kw/super%20mario%203d%20all%20stars" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo support website</a> saying that the update addresses "several issues" to "improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The update notes do not detail what these issues were or how gameplay is improved when playing on Switch 2. 3D All-Stars also received an update on June 3, shortly before the Switch 2's launch, but Nintendo's website used identical language then, offering no specifics. 3D All-Stars is not on Nintendo's list of Switch 1 games that received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-1-games-will-get-free-updates-on-switch-2/1100-6530570/" data-ref-id="1100-6530570">Switch 2 enhancements via free updates</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Super Mario 3D All-Stars Review</p>
      </div>
<p>An observer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1m04l1y/super_mario_3d_all_stars_version_113_is_now/n36qdon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> who booted up 3D All-Stars after the Switch 2 update claims that it still runs at 1080p in docked mode, adding that the UI may have received a resolution upscale. Other users note that Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine still run at 30fps post-update.</p><p>Originally released in September 2020 for Nintendo Switch to celebrate Mario's 35th anniversary, Super Mario 3D All-Stars includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Infamously, the game was only<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-limited-time-availability-for-super-mario-3d-all-stars-other-games/1100-6485623/" data-ref-id="1100-6485623"> available for purchase for about six months</a> before being pulled from stores and delisted on the Nintendo eShop. Nintendo also gave the same treatment to a battle royale title called Super Mario Bros. 35, ending access to it after the company's 35th anniversary celebrations for Mario concluded at the end of March 2021.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-shoot-for-the-stars/1900-6417564/" data-ref-id="1900-6417564">8/10 review</a> of Super Mario 3D All-Stars called the compilation "a worthwhile collection" while admitting that it had "presentational shortcomings."</p><p>With the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. approaching in September of this year, fans are crossing their fingers that Super Mario 3D All-Stars will get a re-release, preferably with Switch 2 enhancements and the inclusion of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-2-is-mia-so-everybodys-sad/1100-6481777/" data-ref-id="1100-6481777">Super Mario Galaxy 2, which was oddly snubbed</a>.</p><p>But Nintendo is a strange and unpredictable company that could go in any direction without warning. Maybe Nintendo has something bigger planned for the 40th--or maybe it has nothing planned at all. If <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-next-nintendo-direct-it-could-be-coming-in-july/1100-6533149/" data-ref-id="1100-6533149">rumors about a Nintendo Direct this month</a> are true, that would be the next place to look out for any Mario news on that front.</p>
