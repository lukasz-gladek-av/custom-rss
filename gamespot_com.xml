                <p>When player housing arrives in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, players will be retroactively rewarded for past achievements in the form of housing decor, with Blizzard stating "all the time spent in Azeroth is worth something."</p><p dir="ltr">In a new <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24196547" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Blizzard continues to pull back the veil on WoW's long-awaited player housing system, confirming that players will be able to earn housing decor in a number of different ways. Common items like chairs, shelfs, beds, etc. will be widely available from vendors, quests, or other players via the auction house.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Some decor, however, will take more time or effort to unlock. Blizzard described these as "investment" items that may require more time or a significant cost to earn. Housing decor can also come in the form of "Trophies," rewards from long-term achievements or completing specific feats that require skillful play, with Blizzard comparing them to current Mythic+ or raid rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard confirmed that new decor rewards tied to past achievements or feats will be rewarded retroactively the first time a player logs in, and that some decor will be integrated into past expansions for players to unlock using expansion-specific systems or currencies.</p><p dir="ltr">Professions from each expansion, too, will play an important role. All non-gathering professions will be able to craft items for housing, with Blizzard laying out a few examples. Blacksmiths will be able to make objects made primarily of metal, enchanters will be able to create magical objects, and jewelcrafters will craft stone-related objects and gem-studded decorations. Decor from previous expansions will require corresponding reagents and the relevant profession level from that expansion, giving players more reasons to go back into the game's past.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of decorating a home properly shouldn't be difficult, but it does want to give players some "reach-goals" throughout the game to shoot for.</p><p dir="ltr">"That said, it should be easily possible to kit out your home on day one to strike the vibe you're looking for without too much effort," Blizzard said. "Your decor journey should start out awesome and continue to be that all along the way."</p><p dir="ltr">Other details shared by Blizzard include that decor items are shared across a player's entire account, so if they have four chairs total and use three of them in the house for one of their characters, other characters will only have one left to use. Some items will also be limited to how many copies players can have, with an example being that it doesn't make sense to have nine copies of Onyxia's head mounted on the wall.</p><p dir="ltr">For WoW players looking for something more to do ahead of housing's arrival, Blizzard hinted that leveling up professions from previous expansions, as well as completing meta-achievements, might be goals worth pursuing for those looking to get a head start on decorating their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">This is just the latest glimpse at WoW's player housing system, which still does not have a release date but is said to be coming alongside the arrival of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMORPG's next expansion, Midnight</a>. Blizzard previously stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">housing in WoW will be available to everyone</a> and won't come with "exorbitant requirements." It also revealed the systems players will be using to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorate their homes</a>, as well as how its neighborhood housing system will work.</p>

                <p>EA and DICE recently conducted the latest Battlefield Labs testing period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and despite participants agreeing to not share footage online, that's exactly what's happened. Lots of new gameplay videos from the alpha test recently made their way online, and the footage looks pretty impressive.</p><p>Among other things, the videos show off Battlefield 6's new destruction elements, while we also see player piloting a jet, zipping across a massive map. Other videos show off some of the game's numerous ground-based vehicles. You can check out the footage in some of the social media clips below.</p><p>Battlefield 6 gameplay footage has been leaking all over the place, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982">dating back to the first Battlefield Labs test earlier this year.</a> Responding to the leaks, a top Battlefield boss reminded fans that early alpha footage is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-discusses-leaks-and-how-fan-feedback-isnt-everything/1100-6530304/" data-ref-id="1100-6530304">not necessarily representative of the final product.</a> And while DICE encourages fans to submit feedback, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-discusses-leaks-and-how-fan-feedback-isnt-everything/1100-6530304/" data-ref-id="1100-6530304">has its own development plans, too.</a></p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to possibly get into a future test. Battlefield 6, or whatever the game might be called, has been rumored to release in Fall 2025, but EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">it'll be out by March 2026</a>. CEO Andrew Wilson recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sounds-like-battlefield-6s-release-date-will-avoid-gta-6/1100-6529258/" data-ref-id="1100-6529258">EA could shift the game to potentially avoid a clash with GTA 6.</a></p><p>In addition to multiplayer, the next Battlefield game will have a single-player component developed by Motive and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">unannounced mode from Ripple Effect that is rumored to be the return of Portal mode.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 will be the first new entry since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that had a poor launch and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-failed-to-reach-expectations-but-ea-still-had-its-best-q3-in-company-history/1100-6500197/" data-ref-id="1100-6500197">ended up selling below expectations for EA.</a> DICE management blamed the poor results on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-strayed-a-little-too-far-from-what-makes-the-series-fun-ea-exec-says/1100-6507599/undefined/" data-ref-id="1100-6507599">developers working from home during the height of COVID</a>, among other things.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a>'s first major content update arrives on April 29 and will bring with it major changes to the core gameplay loop, as well as brand-new content including a new Breaker and new Crown.</p><p>Lead producer Michael Clark introduced the update in a new trailer, leading with the fearsome new Crown called Maw. Maw has already been teased in the game, and her arena is available pre-update, but this will be the first time players can take her on in combat.</p><p>The new Breaker is called Rondo, who has a new SyCom with two new perks: Bladedancer and Reaper. The content update also inroduces two new weapons for players to wield: the Gloom Shiv and the Dreamblade. The update will also add new environments, a new enemy, and more that the devs haven't yet detailed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqU8OL8Xm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qyqU8OL8Xm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new content isn't the biggest part of the upcoming update, however, with Clark revealing that Hyper Light Breaker is getting a major shakeup to its core run structure. Once the update hits, you will have one life for each run, and upon death you will lose all items in your inventory and the Overgrowth will reset. Clark explains that this change will bring Hyper Light Breaker more in line with a traditional roguelike experience.</p><p>Players will now get more chances to extract from the Overgrowth, being able to do so from any Shrine, and will no longer have to defeat enemies to do so. SyComs will now follow a class-like structure where every character will have one dedicated SyCom, which can have a perk equipped to enable a passive ability. Inventory will be streamlined so that players no longer have to spend so much time managing inventory, and vendors' roles have also been changed.</p><p>The update will also add a brand-new onboarding tutorial aimed at making Hyper Light Breaker more approachable to new players. The tutorial will launch for all players post-update, even if they've already sunk a lot of hours into the game.</p><p>Many of the overarching changes made to the game were inspired by player feedback, Heart Machine said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840?emclan=103582791471715977&amp;emgid=528718979655532652" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam update</a>, thanking players for being a part of the process as Hyper Light Breaker makes its way through early access.</p><p>The Buried Below update arrives on April 29 for Hyper Light Breaker on PC.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has released the patch notes for Diablo 4 Patch 2.2.0, set to drop at the start of Season 8 on April 29. The patch includes a huge number of minor balance changes for player characters, items, and bosses, as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Blizzard's ongoing plan</a> to improve the core gameplay experience throughout 2025. Here's what's new.</p><p>While there aren't many surprises in the patch notes, as Blizzard has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">fairly extensively</a> about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">Season 8 changes</a>, as well as letting players get hands-on with the new seasonal content in the PTR, a few changes will be made based on PTR feedback. The fearsome final form of Belial, who lends his name to the season, has been made even more challenging than it was in the PTR beta, with higher health, damage, and a few new moves up his sleeve.</p><p>Belial isn't the only boss getting a buff from his PTR form--all the Lair Bosses are getting at least minor tweaks or buffs to up the challenge level. Duriel and Gregoire will get new fight mechanics, Lord Zir is getting a damage buff, and Beast in the Ice has some minor tweaks. Varshan is the only one getting an update aimed at making the fight easier--or at least easier to read, thanks to a change to how Tormented Echo of Varshan functions.</p><p>Season 8 is introducing a new mechanic called Boss Powers, where players can literally wield some of the powers used by endgame bosses, which PTR players may have had a bit too much fun with. The version of this mechanic tested in the PTR was evidently way too powerful, as a good number of Boss Powers are getting significant nerfs from their initial PTR stats.</p><p>In news that many players might be happy to hear, Blizzard will be disabling Conduit shrines "until further notice" as they undertake a rework for the controversial shrines. The patch notes say that the decision was made as a result of player feedback, with many Diablo 4 fans feeling like Conduit shrines have become all but useless with recent patches.</p><p>Alongside the big-ticket boss reworks, the patch notes contain a whole lot of small balance changes and minor but welcome quality-of-life upgrades. These include a minor buff for Barbarians, with a specific focus on Whirlwind, improvements to Party Finder, and the ability to quickly teleport to other party members.</p><p>The detailed <a

On the other, they are super rare items to strive for that create moments of celebration once acquired. In previous seasons, Lair Bosses leaned heavily towards supporting the former. In our next season, we want to push more towards a middle-ground, where standard Unique items are readily attainable through Initiate and Greater Lair Bosses, but the path Ancestral Unique items lie directly through defeating the Exalted Lair Boss, Belial, Lord of Lies. Because Belial can reward Ancestral Uniques, we want to give players more freedom on how they get to him. By allowing Initiate and Greater Lair Bosses to have a chance at dropping any Unique item, these bosses should always feel more relevant to fight. Finally, while we like the social element of bossing, the efficiency gained from doing so in a full party is too high. Adjusting the boss summoning flow aims to make the experience more equitable regardless of party size while retaining a small bonus for social play.</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>Common quality items will no longer drop beyond Level 6. Magic quality items will be the most prevalent until around Level 25 whenRare and beyond items start to take precedent.</li><li>Magic items will now appear with 1-2 Affixes, with 2 Affixes becoming standard as player’s level increases.</li><li>Rare items now always appear with 2-3 Affixes, with 3 Affixes becoming more common as your level increases.</li><li>Legendary Item changes  <ul><li>Legendary item drop rates have been reduced during levelling.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Developer’s Note: <em>We've increasing the power of Magic and Rare items during levelling while reducing the Legendary item drop rates to address feedback about Legendaries too quickly become the only item rarity you care about.</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>Hoard Key drop chances have been reduced.</li><li>The Infernal Hordes Aether Reward from the Butcher increased from 25 to 75.</li></ul><h3>Lair Boss Updates</h3><p>All Lair Bosses have been updated to make their fights more challenging and engaging. This includes increased health and damage across the board, and changes to the fight itself.</p><p>Duriel</p><ul><li>New fight mechanics.</li></ul><p>Lord Zir</p><ul><li>Lord Zir's damage has been significantly increased. Added a warning cone to help players see it coming.</li><li>Lord Zir's blood puddles have been reworked. Fewer of them spawn but can grow larger.</li><li>Lord Zir now summons more Bloodseekers with higher health and damage.</li></ul><p>Gregoire</p><ul><li>New mechanics added to the boss arena.</li></ul><p>Varshan</p><ul><li>Each monster absorbed by Tormented Echo of Varshan now turns into a persistent seeking projectile.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Tormented Echo of Varshan's Malignant monster summon and absorption mechanic was complicated, not well communicated and can provide Uber Varshan with some potentially frustrating bonuses (Such as constant shield regeneration and on-hit blind). This change is aimed at making it clearer to the player what is happening.</em></p></blockquote><p>Beast in the Ice</p><ul><li>Various minor tweaks to the encounter.</li></ul><h3>User Interface and User Experience</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the capitalization of the words Element and Elemental when referring to a damage type to properly match other descriptions.</li><li>We’ve named 3 damage types that were previously unnamed:  <ul><li>Shadow Damage over time has been renamed to Corruption Damage.</li><li>Cold Damage Over Time has been renamed to Frostbite Damage.</li><li>Lightning Damage Over Time has been renamed to Sparking Damage.</li></ul></li><li>Tooltips for socketable items have been adjusted to improve clarity on what items can be socketed into what.</li><li>Automatic sorting in the Inventory and Stash has been updated to be more intuitive.

This creates a disjointed early game experience, where the pace of leveling vs. other elements of progression are not aligned. This change reduces the need to constantly upgrade early game items, increases the relative value of activity and seasonal rewards, and creates a more seamless early game journey.</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>Players in a party can now quickly teleport to other members of the party through the Social menu.</li><li>Cosmetic items can now be consumed and unlocked while playing any Class.</li><li>Conduit Shrines will no longer appear.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Developer’s Note: <em>We have heard feedback on the Conduit shrines.

                <p>Fantasy fans are eating well right now, as last week saw the release of not one but two highly anticipated games in that genre. After a few brief leaks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster</a> was shadow-dropped onto PC and console, and just two days later, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was officially released on the same platforms. Could both games co-exist in this swords and sorcery space together? It turns out that they could indeed, as both titles experienced solid weekends on PC, particularly.</p><p>While we don't know what their performance metrics were like on Xbox Series X|S--where both Oblivion and Expedition 33 are available via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>--and PS5, the numbers sound positive so far for Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered. Developer Sandfall Interactive first reported 500,000 sales of Expedition 33 just 24 hours after launch, and after three days, that figure had climbed to 1 million sales. "This number includes units shipped to retailers, and does not encompass our awesome GamePass players," Sandfall Interactive added in a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409444063195168" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">And here we are.<br>Three days after launch.<br>One million copies sold.<br>Thank you for believing in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. <a href="https://t.co/92T2qZxcHP" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/92T2qZxcHP</a></p>  — Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (@expedition33) <a href="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>On Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/" rel="nofollow ">the game reached an impressive concurrent peak of 121,422 players</a>, and combined with players from other PC platforms like the Epic Games Store and Game Pass alongside Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, the overall numbers are likely very high during the game's first weekend.</p><p>In comparison, Oblivion Remastered reached over 4 million players just days after it was released. "We are so grateful to the over 4 million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered," Bethesda said in a post on X/Twitter. In terms of concurrent players on Steam alone, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/" rel="nofollow ">the game reached a peak of 216,784 people on April 27</a>, and similar to Expedition 33, its availability on several platforms, storefronts, and Xbox Game Pass also means that the final numbers are likely even higher.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1915889058024222801" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are so grateful to the over 4 million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered.
