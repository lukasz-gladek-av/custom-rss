                <p>Given the recent difficulties at Ubisoft, it was hard not to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin</a>'<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">s Creed Shadows</a> as a make or break game for the publisher. There's still some uncertainty about Ubisoft's plan to spin-off Assassin's Creed and other top franchises <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">into a dedicated subsidy with Tencent</a>, but the good news is that Shadows is reportedly one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the best-selling games of the year</a> so far.</p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said via his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account that Assassin's Creed Shadows "has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market." Piscatella went on to add that among games released in 2025, it is No. 2 to-date behind only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Prior to that, the No. 2 seller had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. Shadows was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ps5s-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-march-2025/2900-6421/" data-ref-id="2900-6421">the best-selling game on PlayStation Network</a> for March.</p><p>According to Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-impressive-milestone-in-just-one-day/1100-6530275/" data-ref-id="1100-6530275">Shadows reached 1 million players</a> across all platforms in a single day. The game reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/" data-ref-id="1100-6530301">2 million shortly thereafter</a>, but that doesn't necessarily line up to the number of copies sold. Assassin's Creed Shadows is also available to players who subscribe to Ubisoft+. However, the title's current success on the video game sales charts suggests that players are actively buying it as well.</p><p>Shadows still has a long ways to go before it can replicate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/" data-ref-id="1100-6530333">the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>. Ubisoft is reportedly considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/" data-ref-id="1100-6530486">an even higher level of difficulty</a> for Shadows. A large quality-of-life update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/" data-ref-id="1100-6530661">was recently released for Shadows</a>, which includes PS5 Pro upgrades.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Funcom has announced that the launch of Dune: Awakening--the upcoming open-world survival game set in the vast deserts of the Dune franchise--has been delayed three weeks, from May 20 to June 10, but a "beta weekend" has been confirmed for next month to soften the blow.</p><p dir="ltr">Funcom announced the short delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421?l=english" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> on the game's official Steam page. According to the post, the delay is a result of feedback the team received from players involved in the ongoing closed beta test, which the blog calls "invaluable in making sure [they] can launch a quality game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4476856-dune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4476856" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4476856-dune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4476856"></a><figcaption>Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4476856-dune.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Thanks to this process, we’ve concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the blog post says. "This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p><p dir="ltr">The post also announced a "large-scale beta weekend" for sometime "next month," in which more players will be able to access the game and give feedback in the game's official Discord server. However, no specific dates were set for the mentioned beta weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is an open-world survival game set on Arrakis, the harsh desert world of Dune. Players will be able to craft items--including ornithopters and eventually fortresses--and encounter sandworms and other creatures while they search for valuable blue spice.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening will now launch June 10 for PC. Funcom has announced Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 versions of the game, which are set to launch later this year.</p>
