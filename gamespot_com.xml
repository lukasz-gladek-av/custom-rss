                <p>Epic Games has sent a loud and clear message to the cheaters and hackers of the world about Fortnite. The company "took legal action" against a pro player called RepulseGod and banned them from ever participating again in organized tournaments for the battle-royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of that, RepulseGod, whose name is Morgan Bamford, had to return prize money from Fortnite back to Epic. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> reports that the company then donated the reclaimed funds to the <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/" rel="nofollow ">Child's Play Charity</a>, which provides games and technology to children's hospitals. Last but not least, RepulseGod released a public apology video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a> summarizing the situation--which <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" rel="nofollow ">the Fortnite Competitive account on X</a> also highlighted.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XouE9KalIVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments, and I apologize to the Fortnite community for my actions," RepulseGod posted in text on the apology video. "I won't ever cheat in Fortnite again."</p><p dir="ltr">It's unknown exactly how much money RepulseGod was required to return to Epic, though the player admits to sharing their Fortnite account with the player Forbes during qualifications for the 2023 Fortnite Championship Series grand finals.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2</a> is just days away from launching this Friday, February 21.

                <p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones said that he's going to be in a new remastered Tony Hawk game, despite Activision not announcing any new ones.</p><p>"I'm in a Tony Hawk [game] coming out, so they got a new one they're remastering...that's about to come out. I was in the last one," Jones said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPaLb7i-ezl_iTk1bqEwOkJmHOXgFbMax" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Breakfast Club</a>. He was was one of the new playable pro skaters added to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1357">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3umK3xG7Ly4?start=1357" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jones specifically mentioned that the unannounced game was a remaster. Although it's unclear which game he's referring to, he may have also meant remakes. Last year, Tony Hawk's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake was reportedly</a> rejected in order for developer Vicarious Visions to focus on more Call of Duty content. However, Tony Hawk himself came out and confirmed that the series will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">continue on in some form</a>.</p><p>It's unknown what the future of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise holds, but former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">recently revealed</a> that Activision offered Hawk $300,000 and a 1.5% royalty rate to lend his name and likeness to the first game on the original PlayStation. At the time, Kotick claimed that the famous skater was desperate and living out of his car, but his fortunes turned around, as he earned four million in royalty checks from Pro Skater 4.</p>

                <p>Days Gone Remastered will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-preorders-are-now-live-ps4-owners-can-upgrade-for-just-10/1100-6529487/">affordable $10 upgrade</a> to anyone who owns the 2019 survival-action game, but there is a catch here. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-might-not-be-able-to-redeem-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps-plus-extra/1100-6505626/">Like several other PlayStation games</a> that have gotten the PS5 remaster treatment, the upgrade doesn't apply to the PS Plus version currently available in the Game Catalog, or the one that was given away back in April 2021 as a PS Plus freebie.</p><p>Naturally, this hasn't gone over well with fans who have taken to online forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fans-upset-days-gone-remastered-10-ps5-upgrade-offer-doesnt-work-if-you-only-own-the-game-via-ps-plus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) to voice their complaints. As several people have noted, PS Plus is a paid-for subscription service, and in comparison, Microsoft allows Game Pass subscribers to upgrade to premium editions of new releases, allowing them to access the benefits of their upgraded games--like early access--at an attractive price. It is worth noting that you'll still need to purchase the base game on Xbox, if you plan to keep playing without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMWMJdvdRQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XVMWMJdvdRQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another point of contention brought up is that Sony still allows its users to purchase DLC for PS Plus games, and many see the "Remaster" upgrade of Days Gone as a somewhat similar piece of content that can be added onto a game. "This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS Plus game," CoolGur878 wrote. "And, mind you, PS Plus is not a free service."</p><p>Whatever Sony's reasoning, it clearly hasn't gone over well with a vocal section of the Days Gone fandom. For everyone else interested in seeing Deacon St. John's zombie-apocalypse adventure on PS5, there are some impressive visual upgrades to look forward to when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/" data-ref-id="1100-6529467">Days Gone Remastered arrives on April 25</a>.</p><p>Increased foliage draw distance, improved shadow and lighting quality, and VRR support are some of the features being touted by developer Bend Studio, and the game will also come with new content like speedrun, permadeath, and horde modes.</p>

                <p>The PS5 is currently riding high, but everyone always wants to know what's coming next. It's been reported that the PS6 is in the works, and according to former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, the system launching in 2028 feels "right."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida the last console cycle was about seven years long, and if that holds again, the PS6 would debut in 2027, and he said that feels "a bit too early." Stressing that he has no inside information about the PS6, Yoshida said, "If the next PlayStation comes out in 2028, that feels right to me."</p><p>He added that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-console-generation-may-start-in-2028-xbox-court-docs-say/1100-6515423/" data-ref-id="1100-6515423">next Xbox might be planned for 2028 as well</a>, based on a leak from Microsoft, but of course, this may not be true and plans can always change. In any event, Yoshida speculated that there is a chance that the next PlayStation and Xbox devices come out in the same year.</p><p>This would be in keeping with tradition, as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S debuted in not just the same year but the same month back in November 2020.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say that the PS5 generation was "slowed" due to manufacturing issues pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/" data-ref-id="1100-6529481">PS5 just had its biggest sales quarter yet, propelling the system to more than 75 million sold.</a> PS5 sales are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">up compared to PS4 sales in the US over their first 50 months</a>, while Xbox Series X|S sales are down compared to Xbox One.</p><p>It was reported in 2024 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">Intel made a blockbuster bid with Sony to have its own chips help power the PS6</a>. However, Sony is said to have opted to go with AMD instead. AMD currently helps power both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">left Sony earlier this year after 30+ years with the company</a>. Now that he's left Sony, he can arrange his own interviews and speak his mind, and he is certainly doing that. He also recently said he had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">"no choice"</a> but to take a job inside Sony focused on indie games.

Meaning that, instead of looking at a mammoth of a story that can take well over 30 hours at minimum, it's a far smaller slice, this time placing Goro Majima as the main character.</p><p>Despite the absurdity of its premise, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is indeed canon, the story taking place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Majima has amnesia, however, which leads to a fresh start for a standalone tale that is progressively intertwined with the usual swings and roundabouts of a Yakuza story.</p><p>If you're wondering how much there actually is in the game, both from a main story and side activity standpoint, this guide covers how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is and what you can expect to find.</p><h2>How Long is Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii?</h2><p>Defining the length of a Yakuza or Like a Dragon is a tough endeavor due to how many side activities there usually are, as well as the usual length of the main story. <strong>For Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, you're looking at around 15 hours to tackle the main story and some side activities</strong> along the way, structured in five chapters. For reference, Yakuza games usually have around 13 or so chapters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350"></a><figcaption>Optional islands and valuable treasure await on the high seas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg"></figure><p>Now, playing one of these games by only focusing on the primary storyline would be a disservice. Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is packed with lots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-best-skills-to-unlock/2900-6255/" data-ref-id="2900-6255">skills to unlock</a> optional activities to tackle, some of which are:</p><ul><li><strong>Substories</strong>: In usual Yakuza and Like a Dragon fashion, there's an array of smaller stories to tackle. Some are introduced as you progress through the main story, while others require you to go off the beaten path to discover them. You'll either get a new mechanic, minigame, or at least a funny and endearing side story as a result.</li><li><strong>Pirates Coliseum</strong>: Commanding your own ship is a big part of the game, and the Pirates Coliseum is the perfect place to test your current crew and ship loadout. Yes, you can both upgrade and customize the ship, which will come in handy as you confront increasingly harder enemies, both in the coliseum and elsewhere while navigating.</li><li><strong>Crew building and treasure hunting</strong>: Speaking of which, recruiting crew members is a key activity. Most of them have special requests, from gathering items to reaching a specific Pirate Rank level, a reputation system of sorts. Building a good team is crucial to sailing the seas, especially if you're exploring optional islands in search of treasure, which are essentially bite-sized dungeons with a shiny chest waiting for you at the very end.</li><li><strong>Bounties</strong>: Whether you're low on cash or just looking for a challenging smackdown, there are over a dozen fights available to tackle, netting you hefty sums of money in return.</li><li><strong>Honolulu and the usual minigames</strong>: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii places a big focus on the pirate side of things, introducing a new hub called Madlantis as well as waters to navigate and explore. But this is all combined with the existing foundation of Honolulu, Hawaii that was first presented with Infinite Wealth. You get to explore the city at your own leisure and take part in familiar minigames. Most rewards are intertwined with new features like crewmembers and your pirate reputation, making for a great synergy overall.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340"></a><figcaption>Photo Rally is one of the returning activities from Infinite Wealth. As for the mascot, I promise you he's fine. I think.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg"></figure><p>As such, the answer to how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will depend entirely on what you're interested in doing and for how long. Playing on PC, I have over 26 hours logged in, but the in-game time is lower. Since I played for guides, this meant leaving the game open while I took notes and organized screenshots, for example.</p><p>I also played some minigames through completion, which added time, and there were some activities that I barely took part in, which I'm sure would have added at least another dozen hours to the overall count. Regardless of what you choose to do, the high seas of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii are yours for the taking.</p>
