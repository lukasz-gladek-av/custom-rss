                <p>Nightdive Studios, a company known for efforts in updating and preserving outdated video games, has revealed that it would like to start remastering games from the PS3 and Xbox 360 era.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, studio head Stephen Kick and director of business development Larry Kuperman said that they want to look at games that were only released on PS3 and Xbox 360 for potential remasters. When taking into consideration which games that could be remastered, Kuperman said that there are many factors that come into play.</p><p>These include things like having access to the game's source code and original assets, as well as examining what consoles the game currently lives on. Games that are exclusive to one console, for example, might be more in need of a refresh. This is what makes tackling PS3 and Xbox 360 era titles such an exciting prospect.</p><p>Kick brought up Free Radical Design and Ubisoft's 2008 PS3 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/haze-review/1900-6191308/" data-ref-id="1900-6191308">Haze</a>. He explained that Nightdive would approach the developers about remastering their games and ask them what they'd do differently if they had the chance and a larger budget.</p><p>Additionally, bringing over older games to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. In addition to giving players easier access to older games, bringing over old titles to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. Despite this, however, there has been some hesitancy around remastering PS3 games, as they can also prove difficult due to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remember-when-ps3-almost-lost-the-console-race/1100-6479595/" data-ref-id="1100-6479595">unique system architecture</a>. However, Nightdive says that it's up for the challenge.</p><p>"If we get to that, or I should say, when, we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face," Kick explained. "But I think that weâ€™ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</p><p>In other Nightdive Studios news, Kuperman recently said that an update regarding the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hope-for-system-shock-3-isnt-lost-yet/1100-6530444/" data-ref-id="1100-6530444">System Shock 3</a> could come sometime within the next year.</p>
