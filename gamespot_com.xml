                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released just a couple days after Microsoft surprise-released Oblivion Remastered, prompting some to wonder why two Game Pass games heavily promoted by Xbox might release so close to each other. Some wondered and worried if Expedition 33 might have struggled as a result. But the game shipped more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">1

would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa," Handrahan said of the impression he got working in games media before joining Kepler.</p><div

"We felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game," he said.</p><p>To sum up, Handrahan said, "Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis said 35% of Expedition 33 players overall also played Oblivion Remastered, with 55% of Expedition 33 players on Xbox also spending time with Oblivion Remastered. The crossover was more limited on Steam (22%) and PS5 (16%).</p><p>Xbox was also the most popular platform overall for Expedition 33, Ampere found, saying 45% of all players came from Xbox, with 47% of Oblivion Remastered players on Xbox. PS5 was No. 2 for Expedition 33, making up 30% of players, with Steam following as the third-biggest platform (25%).</p><p>For Oblivion Remastered, Ampere's data said Steam was No. 2 (34%) followed by PlayStation (19%). The preference for Xbox for both titles was attributable in part to both games being included with Game Pass, the report said.</p><p>While Xbox was the top platform for both Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered, it wasn't the biggest platform for either title based on playtime. Ampere said the average playtime for Expedition 33 on Xbox was 2.2 hours, compared to 4.4 hours on PlayStation and Steam. For Oblivion Remastered, PlayStation users played an average of 3.8 hours, compared to 3.6 hours on Steam, and 2.2 hours on Xbox.</p><p>All of the figures here from Ampere cover data from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe, from each game's launch through Sunday, April 27. Oblivion Remastered, of course, came out two days before Expedition 33, which no doubt had an effect on Ampere's findings.</p>

Rather than offering full-scale, action-packed battles across the universe, Trinket Studios' next game instead boils things down to a sleek, card-based battle system, which focuses on resource management and strategy rather than brute force action--all while adding dozens of interesting characters with fully voiced dialogue on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing an hour-long demo, it's immediately clear that Trinket is on to something with this unique approach, but it's too early to tell if the experiment will stick the landing. Battle Suit Aces is trying something different, and so far, the results are worthy of your attention.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battle Suit Aces - Official Reveal Trailer | Future of Play 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aces high</h2><p dir="ltr">Battle Suite Aces follows a simple premise: A group of spacefarers called the Patchworks travel the universe in a massive spaceship called the USS Zephyr, as they explore planets looking for ancient tech. In their travels, they have found and commandeered a Gundam-adjacent mech suit, and eventually they meet other characters with mech suits of their own.</p><p dir="ltr">The crew fights against the Frenzied, mysterious monsters that can attack without notice and devastate everything in their path. The Zephyr and its crew meet the Frenzied multiple times throughout the demo, an excellent introduction to Battle Suit Aces' novel battle system.</p><p dir="ltr">Fights take place via a card-battling system, where each character you've recruited is represented by a card featuring their mech. There are also secondary cards--in the demo, for example, these are all attack drones--which can attack for you as needed. The USS Zephyr, meanwhile, is the "player" of these cards, but it has a set life total--if enemies attack enemy spaces on your side of the board, the Zephyr will take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595"></a><figcaption>Battle Suit Aces uses cards to depict space battles between mechs, ships, and drones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the board, the battlefield is a single row containing five slots, and only one card can fit in a slot at a time. As you fill slots in the row with cards, you accrue energy in whichever color is represented on the card--the deck in the demo contains blue and red energy (the full game may have more), so you'll accrue one energy of a certain color for each card in your row. After energy is accrued, you can choose how to spend it on attacks and other abilities, and you can also move cards to different slots once per turn in order to maximize the turn's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the full strategic prowess of the Battle Suit Aces fighting system comes into play. Each battle is won by reducing the HP of the main enemy to zero, and you damage that enemy the same way they can damage the Zephyr--by firing a card's weapon into a slot not occupied by an enemy card. If the opponent places a card in an empty slot, damage will be taken by that card before the main enemy will, meaning that each card is "protecting" its leader when placed.</p><p dir="ltr">Every battle in the demo offered multiple different paths to victory, creating an engaging and sometimes stressful experience. Early battles are easy, as they're normally won by moving a powerful mech to empty slots as needed. Later on, the demo throws a couple of curveballs into the battle mechanics; one battle creates more enemy cards whenever one of their own is killed, while another places shields in each slot which need to be broken before the main enemy can be damaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596"></a><figcaption>Between missions, you can customize your deck of cards.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a battle, you can visit different rooms on the USS Zephyr and make changes to your mechs, drones, and more in different rooms of the ship. This adds an air of customization to the experience, as it lets you throw your ideal curveballs at an enemy ship depending on your chosen loadout. I really like the way Trinket Studios has already shown it can tweak the battle system on the fly, and I'm excited to see what sort of mad scientist experiments later battles in the game will present.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The heart of the cards</h2><p dir="ltr">Battling in Battle Suit Aces is fun, but the real joy comes from listening to the characters interact with one another. Each character is fully voiced, and unique personalities burst from each of those voices. Heathcliff is the leader of the crew and an adept engineer in his own right. Daciana is a fiery mechanic with a seedy backstory. Jules is a researcher obsessed with analyzing every last inch of ancient tech--and he drinks a <em>lot</em> of coffee. The dozen or so characters I met in this demo all burst with personality, and their back-and-forth banter elicited more than a few laughs. There were a few references to potential plot points in the main game too.</p><p dir="ltr">These characters are the emotional heart that brings the rest of Battle Suit Aces to life, and listening to their stories unfold is very cool. However, this demo is heavily unbalanced in terms of "dialogue time" versus "gaming time." There is a hefty amount of dialogue that you have to skip through, and while it's all important and worthy of your attention, it does mean it will take a while to get from one card battle to the next.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597"></a><figcaption>Like Battle Chef Brigade, Battle Suit Aces' biggest strengths are its gorgeous art and intriguing characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do decide to listen, there's also a ton of information being thrown at you all at once, and it may leave you wondering what the heck is happening in this game. Some of the terms are easy enough to pick up--Blue Crest is the name of the ancient mech, the Pholians are the ancient race who developed the tech, etc.--but there are some sentences that sound like complete rubbish out of context. If you're the type that likes to have all of the information all at once, you may experience an overload of that info before long, especially in the time constraints of an hour-long demo.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Suit Aces smashes a bunch of different elements together--mech suits, spaceships, card battles, upgrade systems, dialogue trees, and more--into an interesting package. Card battles are fun and engaging, especially when extra wrinkles are thrown in to challenge you in new ways. The crew of the Zephyr are shaping up to be the emotional weight of the story, with a few interesting details already spilling out in this short demo playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo only offered a limited amount of time with Trinket Studios' latest, but despite the brevity, I'm hopeful that the full experience will come up aces.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo for Battle Suit Aces is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

It's been discovered that the patch has made a key change to how the eShop charts work, with the apparent aim of de-prioritizing so-called "shovelware."</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-changed-its-eshop-charts-in-an-apparent-move-to-hide-shovelware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reported that the update changes the eShop charts such that it now ranks games based on revenue from sales in the past 72 hours. Previously, the ranking was based on total sales volume over the past 48 hours.</p><p>The eShop--and Xbox, PlayStation, and PC digital storefronts--are filled with shovelware-type games that are known to be misleading, low-quality, and inexpensive. One popular theory is that the publishers of these types of games sell their titles at low prices to help them rank higher in the charts. Under the new eShop ranking system, this might not be as effective.</p><p>VGC and others have pointed out how this new system could negatively impact higher-quality lower-priced games. But it remains to be seen how it'll all shake out in the end. Also unknown is how the eShop might work on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, which launches in June.</p><p>The Switch's ver. 20.0.0 update arrived earlier this week, introducing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a> feature announced during the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/" data-ref-id="1100-6530545">GameShare</a> support and other compatibility with the upcoming Switch 2 system.</p><p>After installing the update, digital titles and DLC you've purchased will now be converted to Virtual Game Cards. These function similarly to physical game cards. You can load and share your digital games between two Switch systems, making it easier to manage your digital library. You can also loan out digital games temporarily to other users within your family group.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">full rundown of the 20.0.0 Switch update.</a></p>

That means it still has many of the fun quirks that give the 2006 version so much of its personality, ranging from humorous bugs to an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-makes-the-originals-most-infamous-dialogue-blooper-even-better/1100-6531066/" data-ref-id="1100-6531066">infamous voice line</a> mix-up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZwGpgcHH0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7wZwGpgcHH0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That also means it includes a secret house where players can talk to, piss off, and persuade Howard. As broken down by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastered-todd-howard-easter-egg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and shown in videos like this one from user Uzis on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZwGpgcHH0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, he's not in the game proper--players won't bump into him just casually walking the streets of the Imperial City. Instead, players need to use a console command to teleport to a hidden test house by bringing up the in-game console commands on PC and typing "coc toddtest" and pressing Enter.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the house, players will find an NPC named Alban Corinis wearing Elven armor. Talking to him at first reveals he doesn't initially have Howard's voice, instead reciting a bit of quest dialogue by a different NPC. Afterwards, however, players can choose between a number of different conversation topics like Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">Clicking these emotion-based topics will see the NPC react accordingly in Howard's voice. The dialogue choices are actually bypassing Oblivion's confusing persuasion minigame to change the NPC's disposition, and players can see the results by once again setting the Howard-voiced NPC to Neutral.</p><p dir="ltr">Howard will reply in all kinds of ways, ranging from saying "You are indeed a bastard" when he's angry to being madly in love when he says "I can't recall ever loving moments, like this moment, with you."</p><p dir="ltr">Since Howard is far from a professional voice actor and was just recording these lines as a test, it all comes across as a bit strange when he's acting surprised and exclaiming, "Oh no! What do we do? I'm so scared!" or confessing his love.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, all part of Oblivion's charm. As noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, the game's rough edges, strange-looking characters, and sometimes-confusing mechanics are part of what give it its character. Retaining all that weirdness for Oblivion Remastered, including this strange Howard test NPC, is just another example of why the original game is beloved by so many.</p>
