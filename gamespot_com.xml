          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline right now, but fortunately it's not because anything is wrong. Quite the opposite, in fact--Fortnite is down because of routine scheduled maintenance that Epic does with every update. In this case, the update is a big one: the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite battle royale Chapter 6 Season 2</a>, featuring major changes to the island, piles of new weapons and gadgets, and the arrival of Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Chapter 6 got off to quite a bang during Season 1, as Fortnite introduced the permanent OG mode with its own separate battle pass, and also the Counter-Strike-esque Ballistic mode. In January, the season ramped up once more with the addition of the player-controlled Godzilla boss and the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Festival. But all things must come to an end--we had our fun with the ridiculous Typhoon Blade, but now it's time to move on to less civilized weapons, like the big drill weapon we saw in the trailer.</p><h2><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 start time</strong></h2><p>When the servers come back up, it'll be Lawless season, which is all about committing armed robbery. That's right, it's Fortnite's fourth heist-themed season. But where the past seasons like this had more of a classy bent, Lawless season is going to be more in the vein of Grand Theft Auto--mayhem is the name of the game here.</p><p>Since we're already in downtime, the wait shouldn't be too long. Fortnite went offline at 2 AM ET/11 PM PT, and season updates typically take somewhere in the ballpark of 4-7 hours. If all goes well, you could be fragging away in Crime City by 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. But don't take that as a given--when Chapter 5 Season 2 launched a year ago, something went wrong, and Fortnite stayed offline until the evening. But that was a very unusual case. Most seasons launch between 4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET.</p><p>Every new battle royale season dramatically changes the gameplay meta, and Season 2 will not be an exception. This crime-fueled season will add a new urban location, Crime City, as well as a bundle of new tools, like timed explosives, sticky grenades, and a rocket drill, that will help you steal gold and whatever else you can find. For more on what you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">check out our rundown here</a>.</p>
