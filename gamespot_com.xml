                <p>Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called "gross misconduct." The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">accused Rockstar of union busting</a> for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fired-rockstar-games-developers-fight-for-payroll-relief-at-employment-tribunal-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given "interim relief" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week.</p><p>The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.</p><p>"We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel," a Rockstar spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed."</p><p>There is some question as to whether the alleged break of confidentiality had anything to do with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. A report from November 2025 noted that the employees in question shared details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar's rule changes for Slack</a>, which eliminated most of the personal and non-work channels. That story also stated that Rockstar's internal security is so tight that employees can't even check their work emails unless they are in the office.</p><p>This case may boil down to whether Rockstar can prove that the employees shared sensitive details that violated their terms of employment. The case has drawn a considerable amount of attention worldwide. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and MP Chris Murray</a> have both pledged to look into it, but the legal battle may take a long time to play out.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed its first set of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-joy-con-2-light-purple-light-green-preorder-roundup/1100-6537276/" data-ref-id="1100-6537276">new Joy-Con controllers</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">pretty expensive</a> right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.</p><p>Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as "Light Green." Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632816" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632816"></a><figcaption>The new Switch 2 Joy-Cons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png"></figure><p>However, the problem with these new Joy-Cons is that, for the most part, you won't actually <em>see</em> these colors. When using your Switch 2 in handheld mode or with the Joy-Con grip, the strips of color on the inner portion of the controllers are entirely hidden. So while these colors might be pretty, it's a bit disappointing that they are essentially relegated to two small rings around the thumbsticks.</p><p>So sure, if you are just looking to pick up a second pair of Joy-Cons simply to have a second pair of Joy-Cons you might as well grab these; there's at least a <em>small </em>difference between them and the standard red and blue controllers that come with the console. That said, it's just a bummer that they lack the same level of whimsy, creativity, and variation as the original Switch's Joy-Cons.</p><p>The good news is you can (kinda) remedy this issue so long as you're willing to spend an extra $20. Shortly after the Joy-Cons were revealed, gaming accessories company Dbrand announced it had already created a <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/nintendo-switch-2-skins#/customizer/details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Joy-Con skin</a> that perfectly matches the new colorway. It's not an official fix, sure, but to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mbwuee3lgt2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quote the brand</a>, it "does what Nintendon't."</p>
