                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> debuted earlier this year, its similarities to Pokemon led observers to expect a legal response from Nintendo. That finally happened in September, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo filed a lawsuit</a> against Palworld developer Pocketpair in Japanese court alleging infringement on the company's patents. Now, Pocketpair has shared details about which patents Nintendo's claims are based on, and how much money the company wants out of the case.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. All three patents were registered earlier this year. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered around the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>The lawsuit is asking for an injunction against Palworld, plus 5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 in American dollars) payments--with late fees--to both Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. The details of the lawsuit largely lineup with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">the predictions made earlier this year</a> by Kantan Games CEO and video game analyst Serkan Toto. At the time, Toto believed that Nintendo's allegedly infringed-upon patents would be "very technical" in nature, and that Pocketpair will ultimately be forced to make a deal with Nintendo.</p><p>So far, Poketpair hasn't slowed down its ambitions for Palworld. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">recently ported to PlayStation 5</a>, and it has even been released in Japan despite the ongoing lawsuit. Poketpair has also struck a deal with Sony to form <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">Palworld Entertainment</a>, which will expand the franchise and create new merchandise and licensing opportunities.</p>

                <p>Sony just revealed new sales numbers for PS5, and set expectations on what kinds of games will be coming in the future for the console.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_sonypre.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">financial report from Sony</a>, the company said it shipped 3.8 million PS5 consoles during the second quarter of the fiscal year from July 2024 to September 2024. That was 29% drop from the same time period last year. The new lifetime total units shipped is now 65.5 million, making the amount just shy of the 67.5 million PS4 units shipped when it was in the same period of its lifespan.</p><p>On the bright side, Game &amp; Network Services division brought in about $7 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase. Sony attributed this to third-party games on the PS5 platform, including "an action RPG title from China," which is most likely referring to Black Myth: Wukong. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-has-now-sold-18-million-copies-expansion-coming/1100-6526290/" data-ref-id="1100-6526290">sold 18 million copies within the first two weeks of release</a>.</p><p>Sony's Network services revenue increased 18% year-over-year during the same time period last year. According to Sony, this was a result of subscribers joining higher tiers of PlayStation Plus and increased subscription prices.</p><p>Sony also commented on its upcoming portfolio of releases, saying that it will continue to have a mix of both single-player and multiplayer games. It acknowledged that while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 was a huge success</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">cancellation of The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">removal of Concord</a> provided lessons on how to move forward with its live-service plans.</p><p>Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-major-sony-franchise-game-releases-are-coming-until-april-2025-at-earliest/1100-6521071/" data-ref-id="1100-6521071">previously stated</a> that it would not have any more major first-party releases until April 2025. However, the single-player follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/joker-2-release-date-cast-plot-trailer/2900-5255/" data-ref-id="2900-5255">Ghost of Yotei</a>, is slated for next year, and Haven Studio's live-service game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-new-ps5-and-pc-game-from-assassins-creed-boss-revealed/1100-6514454/" data-ref-id="1100-6514454">Fairgames</a>, is still in development.</p>

                <p>Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous and groundbreaking creative types across all of entertainment, but the man himself doesn't agree that he's a genius. As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion that he's been able for decades to turn out hit after hit because he's a "genius."</p><p>"You referred to me as a 'genius,' but I consider myself quite ordinary," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to say he gives a speech each year to Nintendo's new hires, and the feedback he gets from these people is that he is "surprisingly ordinary."</p><p>Making great games allows Miyamoto to have an easier career, he said. "I often think it would be fun if I didn't have to work, so I'm always thinking about things like, well, if I have to work, how can I do it more efficiently. And if I am going to do the same work, how can I make it more of a hit, because when a project is a hit it makes future work easier," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to reveal more of what he tells new hires coming to Nintendo. He said many people come to work at Nintendo and aspire to make "upgraded versions" of games they've played before. But Miyamoto pushes back against this idea and encourages them to think differently.</p><p>"[Game design] is about observing the world around us and figuring out how to assemble those elements into an engaging video game," he said. "I explain that game design is about planning. That is, it is about assessing what hardware and development environment to use to create the game, whether the desired game can be realized with its available processing power, and engaging in trial and error to bring it to life."</p><p>Miyamoto has had a long and illustrious career at Nintendo. The 71-year-old started at Nintendo all the way back in 1977 and helped create Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda. He's remained a key player at Nintendo to this day in his "Creative Fellow" position, contributing to all manner of Nintendo game franchises. In addition to his work on Nintendo's game franchises, he was an executive producer on 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will produce the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Legend of Zelda film.</a> He's also involved in the Nintendo theme parks.</p><p>Miyamoto has no plans to retire, but has admitted he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">spent time thinking about who may fill his shoes</a> one day.</p><p>As for Nintendo's hardware business, the Switch is now in its eighth year on the market. It's sold more than 146 million units worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">all eyes are on Nintendo to reveal the Switch 2 by April 2025. </a></p>

A question was also pondered: "How many packs have been opened, then?"</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1854728092717129756" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">T-t-t-thirty million?! 🙌 How many packs have been opened, then?🤔 <br>On behalf of everyone working on the game and me, thank you for all your support!

The thought is that when tearing open one of your daily free packs that you should inspect the packaging for any imperfections, like a bent corner. These will then lead to a greater chance for rare cards. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, internet response has been mixed on the success rate for utilizing this strategy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket launched</a> on October 30, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-announced-for-mobile-devices/1100-6521387/" data-ref-id="1100-6521387">the app was unveiled in February</a> during Pokemon Day.
