          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Perfect Dark Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Initiative was formed in 2018 and based in Santa Monica. Billed as a "AAAA" studio, it was led by former Crystal Dynamics studio head Darrel Gallagher and made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-studio-the-initiative-adds-alumni-from-re/1100-6469070/" data-ref-id="1100-6469070">developers from Respawn, BioWare, Naughty Dog, and more</a>. In 2021, The Initiative announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-being-co-developed-by-tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics/1100-6496517/" data-ref-id="1100-6496517">partner with Crystal Dynamics</a>, developer of the most recent Tomb Raider games, to assist on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">Players got their first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">Perfect Dark gameplay</a> in 2024 as part of that year's Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer showed Perfect Dark to be a first-person shooter with immersive sim elements, as series protagonist Joanna Dark used gadgets, stealth, and melee takedowns to complete her objectives, all the while hinting at a greater conspiracy for players to uncover. Despite the gameplay showcase, Perfect Dark did not ever receive a release window.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by this new wave of layoffs at Microsoft. While at the time of writing The Initiative is the only studio closure announced, other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10 and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software have also seen layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty in an internal email shared by Windows Central confirmed Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, and several other unannounced projects, one of which is reported to be ZeniMax Online's next MMORPG, have all been canceled as part of the layoffs.</p><p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty writes in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>It's just the latest round of layoffs for Microsoft in recent years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft laid off an estimated 10,000 people</a>. Following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft laid off an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">estimated 1,900 employees in 2024</a>. That same year it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down four Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. </p>

The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch. Raven also works on Call of Duty: Warzone. Turn 10 Studios, meanwhile, is known for its work on the Forza Motorsport series, the latest entry of which came out in 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>In addition to cutting staff, Microsoft has canceled Rare's Everwild and an unannounced MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios. The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Perfect Dark game has been canceled, too</a>, with its developer, The Initiative, closing up shop.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer claimed in a memo to staff that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">the cuts were necessary to propel Xbox forward to a healthy future.</a> "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," Spencer said in the wake of the cuts.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>
