                <p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">last year's strong showing for Silent Hill</a>, we'll soon learn more about what's next for the horror franchise. Konami has <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> a Silent Hill Transmission--the name it gives to its virtual showcases centered on the series--is coming this Thursday, March 13 at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET. The video will focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, the next mainline game in the series.</p><p>Silent Hill f was revealed in 2022, but we've not seen it since that day. That was when we saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/silent-hill-f-teaser-trailer/2300-6459798/">teaser trailer </a>debut alongside several other Silent Hill projects, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, which is still in development from No Code. Based on the wording of Konami's tweet, it doesn't seem like any other games will be mentioned during the showcase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456847"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f's flowery imagery is memorable, and soon it may be placed in a clearer context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg"></figure><p>Last we'd heard, the oddly named Silent Hill f was in development from Neobards, a studio with experience supporting Resident Evil games, including the remakes for Resident Evil 2 and 3, as well as Resident Evil 7 and its multiplayer mode, ReVerse. The game's story will be penned by famed Japanese writer Ryukishi07, the author of the acclaimed When They Cry visual novel series.</p><p>Should the game be the next to debut in the Silent Hill series, this would make it the first new entry in the series since 2012. It would also be the first from a team based in Japan in more than two decades, the last of which Team Silent's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room/" data-ref-id="5000-20157">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> in 2004.</p><p>We've assembled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">everything we know so far about Silent Hill f</a>, including a theory regarding its strange title, so you can catch up while you wait for this week's Silent Hill Transmission.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann revealed some more narrative details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> in Creator to Creator discussion with Civil War director Alex Garland.</p><p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> revealed Intergalactic, a brand new sci-fi game meant to kickstart a franchise, at The Game Awards 2024. That announcement trailer revealed a fair bit about Intergalactic's premise, namely that it follows a bounty hunter who gets standard on the distant planet of Sempiria. Ahead of season 2 of the popular The Last of Us TV show, Druckmann appeared on Sony's Creators to Creators podcast for a discussion with film director Alex Garland, who is promoting the upcoming film 28 Years Later. Toward the end of the conversation, Druckmann revealed more about the universe Intergalactic is set in and Naughty Dog's goals with the project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iJUab499PVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Druckmann highlights that Intergalactic will be "a game about faith and religion" and is set around 2000 years in the future in a universe that diverged from our own in the 1980s. He reveals that Naughty Dog has created 2000 years of history for the religion of Sempiria, which has been cut off from communication with the rest of the galaxy for the last 600 years prior to the start of the game. He also explained how Naughty Dog wants players to feel lonely and lost in a place whose people and history are mysterious to them.</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5 but does not have a release window at this time. Druckmann admits that the Naughty Dog "still have a ways to go" in developing the game and he doesn't have a clear idea of the final form Intergalactic will take just yet, so don't expect it to release soon.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sony is testing out new AI software, and it's using a beloved character--Aloy from the Horizon series--to show it off.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-RJ7O9Tqf4">YouTube video</a> narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal--a software engineering director at Sony Interactive Entertainment who focuses on gaming tech, AI, and face technology for the Advanced Technology Group within Sony's PlayStation Studios--appeared online last week, giving players a look at an AI-ified version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>'s main character, Aloy.</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal verbally interacts with Aloy throughout the video, starting off by greeting her and asking how she's been doing.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hello, I'm managing alright," AI-Aloy replies flatly. "Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal then proceeds to ask Aloy if she's willing to discuss events that have taken place in the Horizon franchise, like her search for her mother.</p><p dir="ltr">"Certainly," Aloy says, replying to Raghoebardajal's request for info with all the well-acted intonation of a TikTok text-to-speech video. "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which allowed me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked what it's like to be a clone, Aloy replies with nightmare-inducing mouth animations, saying, "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Raghoebardajal requests that Aloy take him into the game world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, we'll transition to the game world now, get ready for the adventure ahead," Aloy replies in a tone so un-emotive it's rather hard to believe any sort of adventure awaits.</p><p dir="ltr">The screen goes black, then transitions to Horizon Forbidden West. Raghoebardajal continues communicating with Aloy in-game, asking her where they are. Using the same expressionless tone she's used for the entire video, Aloy explains that they're at The Scalding Spear, a large settlement near Arrowhand.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Raghoebardajal, AI is being used for Aloy's facial animations, verbal responses, and her voice itself. Notably, the Aloy in this demonstration sounds nothing like Aloy's real-life voice actress, Ashly Burch, who voiced the character in both games. Burch hasn't commented publicly on the demonstration, but has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashlyburch/p/Cw-q5DNx7Yw/" rel="nofollow ">historically supported protections against AI</a> for voice actors in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">As this article was being written, the video was removed from YouTube via a copyright strike filed by Muso TNT Ltd., a company that focuses on content protection and anti-piracy efforts in the entertainment industry. The company recently rebranded, and is now known simply as Muso. It's unclear why the video was taken down or if the footage had been leaked and uploaded by a channel not associated with Sony or Raghoebardajal.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the video has been removed, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge managed to capture a gif</a> of what the demo looked like in action.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is just a glimpse of what is possible," Raghoebardajal said of Aloy's AI demonstration.</p>

                <p>If the internet has taught me anything, its that Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 are two games folks simply cannot get enough of, myself included. Fortunately, a newly-released, fan-made mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Village</a>, combines the two in a pretty spectacular way. With the Baldur's Village mod, Stardew players can add 20+ characters, six new locations, new shops, new items, and new events, all inspired by Baldur's Gate 3, to the popular farming sim.</p><p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," the mods description reads. "You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent."</p><p>After venturing up north, players will be greeted by an entirely new area occupied by several familiar faces, including Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and everyone's favorite, blood-sucking aristocrat, Astarion. Currently, Astarion is the only new neighbor players will be able to romance, as he is the only one the team has finished designing heart events and gift preferences for. However, the team has confirmed that its next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline, followed by expanding world-building background stories and gameplay features.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4456696,1300-4456697,1300-4456698,1300-4456699,1300-4456700,1300-4456701,1300-4456702,1300-4456703,1300-4456704,1300-4456705" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"></figure><p>In order to get the Baldur's Village mod up and running, players will also need to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Modding API</a> (SMAPI), the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Valley Content Patcher</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portraiture mod</a>, all of which can be downloaded for free over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Players already using Stardew Valley mods might already have these downloaded, as several of the game's most popular mods require SMAPI and the Content Patcher to run. Once the mod is installed, players need not worry about starting a new game to experience the Baldur's Gate bliss--the mod should seamlessly integrate the new content into existing save files.</p><p>Despite launching less than 24 hours ago, Baldur's Village is already proving to be a very popular mod, with nearly 90,000 views and 12,000 total downloads as of writing. Considering mods have played a pivotal role in keeping both Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 fresh and exciting for repeat players, the success of Baldur's Village is exciting yet hardly surprising.</p><p>Interested in more mod recommendations from GameSpot?
