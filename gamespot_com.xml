                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is launching in early access later this week, and it's going to diverge from some of the standard conventions of action-RPG titles. While Obsidian Entertainment has already established that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-outer-worlds-2-companions-whom-you-cant-romance/1100-6534102/" data-ref-id="1100-6534102">its six companion characters can't be romanced</a>, the studio has revealed that they can actually turn on the player if you give them enough of a reason.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Expansion Pass</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), game directors Matt Singh and Brandon Adler noted that players' decisions can potentially backfire on them by alienating their companions, who may choose to attack or even attempt to kill the player under the right circumstances.</p><p>"One of the things that was really important is, we wanted these characters to feel like they're their own people," Singh said. "They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player's aligning with them, that's great. They're going to be there for you. They'll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they're going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict. That might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they'll be there for you in the end."</p><p>As an example, Adler noted that the companion character Inez is aligned with the Auntie's Choice faction. If players ignore Inez's request to stop killing members of her group, she won't just leave your team, she'll also attack the player at various points.</p><p>However, Adler added that these turns won't happen in a vacuum, and the companion characters will actually warn players about their deteriorating relationships ahead of time with requests or ultimatums. Players will have the option to try to save their relationships, and also suffer the consequences if they choose to do nothing.</p><p>Obsidian recently introduced a Moon Man plushie called a "Couch-Panion," which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-plushie-could-be-your-friend-or-kill-you-in-your-sleep/1100-6535451/" data-ref-id="1100-6535451">is the prize for winning a contest</a> running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-getting-some-pricy-customizable-xbox-controllers/1100-6535316/" data-ref-id="1100-6535316">Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers</a>, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">shared the launch times</a>, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.</p>

                <p>Greek mythology has been around for thousands of years and its traditions have inspired artists working in nearly every medium. What brings me joy is that each writer, visual artist, director--or in the case of Hades 2, a team of game developers--can explore a unique vision of the characters and events they choose to highlight. With the sequel to its popular hack-and-slash roguelite Hades, Supergiant Games explores the worlds of Greek gods from the perspective of Melinoe, the princess of the Underworld.</p><p dir="ltr">As the playable protagonist of Hades 2, Melinoe shows players a new side of life in the Underworld. Unlike her brother Zagreus, the young witch didn’t grow up with her family in the main palace. She instead lives in a ramshackle camp on the outskirts of Hades’ domain. The distance between her and her loved ones is palpable, and her only connection to her family is a single drawing enshrined in Melinoe’s make-shift room. The game starts when Melinoe, brooding yet powerful, decides to save her family from the Titan of time, Kronos, and finally close the gap that’s always separated them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Yet Hades 2 is far from the only modern reinterpretation that hones in on the women of Greek mythology, and Melinoe’s plights soon reminded me of another story that follows a Greek goddess and witch: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Circe-Madeline-Miller/dp/0316556327?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Madeline Miller's Circe</a>. Published in 2018, this retelling follows the story of the goddess Circe, a witch who was banished to the island of Aeaea by Zeus. If you’ve read The Odyssey, you might know the character as the duplicitous sorceress who transformed Odysseus’ men into pigs. However, Miller’s book gives the reader the chance to imagine the events from <em>her </em>side of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">If you really like Hades 2--and if you are at all interested in the witches of Greek mythology or reading stories that aren’t only about violent dude-bros starting wars--Circe is required reading. I don’t just say this because it’s easy to read and incredibly entertaining; The book also deepened my appreciation of Hades 2 <em>and</em> helped me understand where the story told in the game could have explored certain themes with more depth.</p><p dir="ltr">In Circe, witchcraft is seen as a threat to the higher gods. Unlike the Olympians, who derive their power from their bloodlines, witchcraft draws its strength from the earth. Any person, god, or goddess can harness this power through constant toil and practice. To become a strong witch, Circe grinds--and I mean this literally because she is constantly using her mortar and pestle to process herbs and flowers--day after day in her kitchen, honing her elixirs. What culminates is a very feminine power--one that grows with the steady housewife-like work of maintaining a garden and pantry.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to Circe in the novel, Melinoe must toil repeatedly in order to collect herbs and flowers that upgrade her powers and camp. As a player, I too began to feel like a witch as I honed my powers--learning how to play the game better and slowly collecting resources I needed to upgrade my attacks and stats. Still, Melinoe’s journey is quite different from Circe’s. Her main source of power comes from the other Olympians, who upgrade her sorcery with various boons and stat buffs.</p><p dir="ltr">Melinoe is also the daughter of Hades. Thougher father discourages her quest, he still provides her aid in the form of character upgrades and resources. Playing as Melinoe doesn’t feel like navigating the world as an ostracized witch. Instead, every Olympian meets her with a smile or some chipper quip. The great Zeus--a god known for being a perpetrator of sexual violence--greets her with a chuckle and lends her his power at a moment's notice. Melinoe, unlike the goddesses in Circe’s world, gets to choose her suitor.</p><p dir="ltr">Supergiant Games’ take on the story casts a shiny veneer on the world of Greek mythology. This feels odd at points because, as other critics have pointed out, the stories of Greek <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hades-ii/hades-iis-ill-defined-unserious-world-undermines-the-depth-and-power-of-mythology" rel="nofollow ">mythology typically portray the brutal nature of the gods</a>. Still, the overall cheeriness makes sense given Hades 2 is more-or-less a fun dating simulator with compelling hack-and-slash gameplay. But even given that, it made me feel like Supergiant copy-and-pasted its popular formula with a female protagonist without doing the deep work of trying to imagine how a Greek myth might be different when viewed through a women’s perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, Circe is a lesser god in every sense of the term. She’s not stereotypically attractive compared to other goddesses, so she can’t be married off (which is how her value is defined in the world of the gods). She’s the daughter of a Titan, so she’s considered to be a tier below the Olympians on Mount Olympus. She doesn’t have the inherent raw power of her father Helios, a sun god and who regularly lashes out against her. <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" rel="nofollow ">Unlike Hades 2</a>, Circe is fundamentally a story about transformation--of a woman who finds her own source of power to defy the hierarchy of the gods.</p><p>I don’t think every story about a woman needs to be hard, or marred by some sort of trauma. Hades 2 feels like good, somewhat shallow, fun. I can eat up the gameplay like popcorn and romance hot characters. It's fun to play and I’m glad we have both kinds of stories. But if you want a story that really sinks its teeth into the deep--and very oftentimes difficult--lives Greek witches, then you should definitely give Miller’s Circe a read.</p>

The developer has confirmed that after seven years and 50+ updates, The Sims Mobile will go offline for good on January 20, 2026.</p><p>At 1:59 PM UTC that day, the game will no longer be playable at all. There is no offline mode, so the game will be gone for good at this time.</p><p>"The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You've amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We're proud to have shared this journey with you," the developer said.</p><p>There will be a number of events coming to The Sims Mobile ahead of the shutdown, now through January 2026, and you can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see a complete rundown on EA's website</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/server-shutdowns-claim-another-victim-the-sims-mobile-will-disappear-for-good-in-january/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4588023-screenshot2025-10-20at3.43.11%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588023" data-ratio="0.5521472392638" data-width="815" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4588023-screenshot2025-10-20at3.43.11%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588023"></a><figcaption>Say goodbye to The Sims Mobile.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4588023-screenshot2025-10-20at3.43.11%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The final update for The Sims Mobile went live today, October 20, and from this date forward, players cannot buy any in-game packs or spend real money. Players who have a balance of SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can continue to use these until the game closes in January 2026. Unspent currency will not be eligible for a refund after January 20, 2026.</p><p>The October 20 update also added "unlimited energy" to The Sims Mobile, which will help players progress more quickly while the game remains online.</p><p>On October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from mobile game stores. Anyone who has the game installed currently or previously, however, can keep playing until January 2026.</p><p>EA also announced that on January 6, 2026, all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will be unlocked for everyone. "We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything The Sims Mobile has to offer before the servers close," the developer said.</p><p>EA regularly closes servers for older titles for a variety of reasons, but the company did not provide any details on why The Sims Online is being taken offline in January 2026. The announcement of the game's upcoming closure came not long after EA announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium including Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p><p>While The Sims Mobile is coming to an end, EA continues to support The Sims 4 with new content, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/" data-ref-id="1100-6533647">sold so much DLC for that game that the company doesn't plan to make The Sims 5.</a></p>
