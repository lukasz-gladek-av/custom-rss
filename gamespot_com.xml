<section><p>The classic role-playing series has enjoyed massive popularity in Japan, but it’s time for Western gamers to finally experience this wonderful series.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Although Dragon Quest is one of the most popular game series in the East, it has never quite caught on in the West. Released under the banner of Square Enix, the series was often overshadowed by sister series Final Fantasy. While this never stopped any mainline entry from being released in the West (except for X, which is an MMO), I can’t help but feel that Dragon Quest never got the due it deserved. Its pedigree and influence is rooted in some of the earliest examples of role-playing games, and each game in the series utilizes that inspiration to craft a wonderful experience with mass appeal and its own ingenuity.. With all that said--and the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-632913">Dragon Quest I &amp; II - HD-2D Remake</a>--it’s time for you to finally play Dragon Quest.</p><p>The case for playing Dragon Quest begins with the start of the RPG genre as a whole. When Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord released in 1981, it helped define what would later become known as the dungeon-crawler, a type of role-playing experience that asked players to form a party of various heroes with gear and venture into an unknown space to fight monsters and seek treasures. Wizardry streamlined the dice rolling and stat math of Dungeon &amp; Dragons and condensed it into video game form, allowing players to venture into the same peril of their tabletop on their glowing screens for the first time ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake – Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Ultima followed soon after, and took this new, streamlined version of tabletop role-playing games and added an explorable open world to the mix. What was once relegated to hexagonal graph paper and imagination was now fully playable in the digital realm of entertainment. Wizardry and Ultima were some of the first examples of what gamers everywhere would come to know as RPGs.</p><p>Wizardry and Ultima inspired Enix developer Yuji Horii to develop his own RPG for the Nintendo Famicom. Using an overworld map layout inspired by Ultima and the stat-based-command combat system of Wizardry, he set out to create his own version that would appeal to Japanese audiences.The resulting game, Dragon Quest, released in 1986.</p><p>With Dragon Quest, Japanese audiences were introduced to a setting inspired by swords and sorcery yet unique in its visual identity. A large part of this is due to Horii recruiting famed Dragon Ball artist and creator Akira Toriyama for the enemy and character designs, giving the game a unique fairy-tale feel as opposed to its Western contemporaries' darker aesthetic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4602773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4602773"></a><figcaption>A battle in Dragon Quest HD-2D Remake. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png"></figure><p>Dragon Quest (first released in the US as Dragon Warrior) follows a descendant from the legendary hero of Erdrick as they’re summoned to save the world from the evil Dragonlord, who seeks ultimate power. In the game, players traverse a diverse overworld as the lone hero, fighting monsters to gain the power needed to defeat the Dragonlord as they wander. The battle system plays out from a first-person perspective, and sees players select commands before watching them play out on screen, eventually leading to the end result of battle. This combat system would go on to serve not only as the foundation for the rest of the series, but as inspiration for many of the RPGs that would follow.</p><p>Not long after its release, Dragon Quest exploded in popularity in Japan, leading to speculation that Square Enix was not allowed to release an entry in the series on a weekday because of the amount of people who would inevitably call out sick or ditch school to play the newest installment.</p><p>Part of this popularity stemmed from the simple fact that each entry in the Dragon Quest series is consistent in ways that a series like Final Fantasy isn’t. Up until recently, the series has always had involvement from creator Yuji Horii, character designer Akira Toriyama, and composer Koichi Sugiyama. So whereas a series like Final Fantasy may change developers and subsequently falter or be less appealing aesthetic- or gameplay-wise from entry to entry, Dragon Quest maintains a distinct identity and high level of quality from entry to entry.</p><p>Dragon Quest also lends itself to episodic play, with narratives that often take place over a large span of time. Take, for example, Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age, where our heroes are put on a quest but don’t quite face world-threatening events until the narrative is closer to the finale. This allows the game to take its time introducing every character and backstory, but also allows players to take their time and experience all the stories and vignettes the world has to offer.</p><p>The series has also had an influence on other wildly popular series. For example, Dragon Quest is actually both the in-game and real-life reason that the Yakuza/Like A Dragon series has shifted to a turn-based RPG. Though often misattributed to Persona, protagonist Ichiban Kasuga makes it clear that Horii's iconic series is the driving influence as he states that, because Dragon Quest is his favorite video game of all time, he pictures every combat encounter as turn-based in his mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602774" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602774"></a><figcaption>A look at Yakuza: Like A Dragon's turn-based combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg"></figure><p>Part of the reason I believe Dragon Quest hasn’t quite taken off in the West is because, for the longest time, the series was relegated to handheld and mobile devices. Whereas Final Fantasy always received big-budget console entries following the Square and Enix merger, Dragon Quest IV through VI got Nintendo DS North American debuts, Dragon Quest IX was a Nintendo DS exclusive, and Dragon Quest X skipped North America entirely. For the longest time, Dragon Quest VIII was the only mainline console entry post-merger.</p><p>But times have changed, and we live in a world where players might be seeking those classic RPG experiences. Fortunately, Square seems to be attempting to make it right. This past year, Dragon Quest III (arguably the most beloved entry in the series) received a full remake in the gorgeous 2D-HD style similar to Octopath Traveler. Last month, remakes of Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II in the same style were released to critical acclaim. A brand-new installment, Dragon Quest XII, is currently in development, with Yuji Horii once again overseeing the project. Perhaps most exciting though is a full remake of Dragon Quest VII releasing soon with the “Reimagined” subtitle.</p><p>The seventh installment is notorious for being perhaps one of the longest RPGs of all time, but also features arguably the best story in the entire series. VII originally came out for the original PlayStation and had a remake on 3DS, but has never been rereleased otherwise. Reimagined looks to remain faithful to the original gameplay experience with much needed quality-of-life improvements, but also brings to life Toriyama’s beloved art style in ways that have not been done before, featuring in-game character models that are based on high-resolution scans of physical dolls made of the main cast of characters. It's a touch of love and care that the series doesn’t often get.</p><p>While other RPGs remain popular, there’s something endearing about the Dragon Quest series as a whole. Whether it’s the classic sword-and-sorcery aesthetics, the charming music and art style, or the more relaxed level of play, the series has found a way to endure. In a world where RPGs aim to be more complex and modern, there's a void in gaming that’s filled by the Dragon Quest games. It’s time you finally gave the series a chance and experienced the legend of one of gaming’s best role-playing games.</p>

                <p>Indie MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ashes-of-creation/" data-ref-id="5000-702799">Ashes of Creation</a>, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50.</p><p dir="ltr">That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGSoApuHbO0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iGSoApuHbO0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ.</p><p dir="ltr">"Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states.</p><p dir="ltr">Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">"Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players."</p><p dir="ltr">Ashes of Creation ran a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2021/05/01/ashes-of-creation-opens-500-alpha-one-package-on-may-5-shows-off-raid-boss-in-new-video/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay $500</a> for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-mmo-canceled-by-marvel-rivals-publisher/1100-6536090/" data-ref-id="1100-6536090">one set in the Warhammer universe</a> and another called project Ghost led by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netease-shutters-mmo-studio-led-by-former-wow-veteran-after-two-years/1100-6535899/" data-ref-id="1100-6535899">former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-is-ending-new-content-after-season-10/1100-6535786/" data-ref-id="1100-6535786">active development on its MMO New World</a>, which once had more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-passes-900000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6496765/" data-ref-id="1100-6496765">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-amid-major-layoffs-report/1100-6535821/" data-ref-id="1100-6535821">canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO</a>.

A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO</a>.</p>

                <p>To commemorate the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, the Australian PlayStation team has built what they claim to be the biggest memory card ever made in Australia.</p><p>This is the country's largest memory card, but not in the traditional memory-space manner. Instead, the Australian PlayStation team erected a physical memory card that stands six meters tall, or about 20 feet tall. That's about a <a href="https://colinmagazine.com/blogs/news/playstation-celebrates-30-years-in-australia-with-a-giant-memory-card-at-sydney-s-harbour?srsltid=AfmBOoqYvWflHKjJsY-5iguyBziBOL2nzpXjkTheP45Wvyh2mzEqafZv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">100-times-scale recreation</a> of an actual PS One memory card.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Trophy unlocked: Build Australia's BIGGEST Memory Card 🏆 Thanks to everyone who came down to celebrate PlayStation Australia's 30th Anniversary.

  </div><p>The card was built at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal in The Rocks, and it's truly a sight to behold with the iconic Sydney Opera House in the background.</p><p>PlayStation Australia created the memory card for a free event this past weekend on Saturday, November 15, where attendees could take part in an Astro Bot speedrunning tournament and receive special 30th-anniversary giveaways.</p><p>The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, but didn't come to other markets--including Australia, the US, and Europe--in 1995.</p><p>As for the PS5, Sony's newest PlayStation console has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">sold more than 84 million units</a>, meaning it's basically even with the PS4 over a similar period of time.</p>

                <p>The delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 to November 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-delays-gta-6-and-the-internet-responds-exactly-as-youd-expect/1100-6536039/" data-ref-id="1100-6536039">disappointed the general public</a>, but Rockstar's release date shuffling also has a significant impact on competing game development studios.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=Yt0DiC7VSgKYga6x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about a variety of industry hot topics, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani spoke about how GTA 6's delay affects his studio's planning and work on Helldivers 2.</p><p>"It gives us a stay of execution," Jorjani said, adding: "Us and everyone else."</p><p>Jorjani described the release of GTA 6 as an event that will "blot out the sun in a way unimaginable for everyone else." Rockstar's game releasing six months later than previously announced should give Arrowhead "another six months of uninterrupted work without GTA looming over us." And while Arrowhead tries to plan its content without considering other releases, Jorjani admitted that "GTA has obviously been very hard to avoid."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVTlQR__ZU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="584">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AyVTlQR__ZU?start=584" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The ominous shadow of GTA 6 is on the minds of everyone working in the games industry, with one veteran Saints Row developer recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-can-compete-with-gta-says-saints-row-dev/1100-6536051/" data-ref-id="1100-6536051">proclaiming that Rockstar is "impossible" to compete with</a>.</p><p>With the release date of GTA 6 shifting multiple times, studios have had to adjust their own plans to avoid competing with Rockstar's blockbuster launch. Even other prolific game developers like <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-everyone-would-move-out-of-the-way-of-gta-6-but-death-stranding-2-is-95-percent-complete-and-its-release-date-was-decided-a-long-time-ago/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima acknowledged</a> that "everyone would move out of the way" of GTA 6.</p><p>It's easy to imagine other prolific studios sharing Arrowhead's general strategy of not taking other competing releases into account, but GTA 6 changes the calculus. It's expected to have an earth-shattering launch, although at least one analyst predicts that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">won't be enough to save a struggling games industry</a>.</p><p>All eyes remain fixed on Rockstar, which may be on its way toward a contentious legal battle after the company dismissed more than 30 employees, with the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain accusing the studio of union-busting. Since then, over 200 current Rockstar workers have signed letters <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">demanding their former colleagues be reinstated</a>.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil's next entry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, arrives next year, but it's very different from its original idea. While it'll have the trademark horror and aesthetics, Requiem was originally designed as an online open-world multiplayer game before Capcom decided to return it to a single-player format. However, not everything was completely reformatted from the ground up.</p><p>"There are some remaining elements, but we can't disclose what [they are]," producer Masato Kumazawa told <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>, explaining that while the multiplayer project was shaping up to be a good game, it wasn't scary enough.</p><p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," he continued. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play, but we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they probably wouldn't enjoy it as much."</p><p>Requiem's development has spanned six years, including its time as a multiplayer project.</p><p>Kumazawa stated that what fans want most from Resident Evil is "survival-horror and being scared," calling fear "the number-one thing that fans want." Because of that, he said the team "couldn't just slap on new skins and new characters" and give players the same experience. Instead, they wanted to focus on delivering something that feels fresh while still fitting the expectations of the franchise.</p><p>The story introduces the new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, who begins her journey overwhelmed and in immediate danger. Director Koshi Nakanishi said this contrast is intentional, explaining that Grace starts "way over her head in danger," and described her evolution as a dramatic rise in strength. He even goes as far as to call it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-may-be-the-most-extreme-in-the-series-says-director/1100-6534329/" data-ref-id="1100-6534329">the most extreme gap</a>" between helplessness and power in the series.</p><p>Nakanishi also spoke about internal playtests, saying the team feels the game delivers "an incredible rollercoaster." He noted that players will experience a strong "curve of tension to release," with the two feelings "so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible." This design approach, he said, reflects the team's goal of making Grace's development feel meaningful while keeping the game rooted in the series' survival-horror style.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2025, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>
