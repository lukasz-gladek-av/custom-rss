                <p dir="ltr">For years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players have been wondering when the game would take them to a location teased way back before the original Destiny was even released: Old Chicago. With the release of its latest expansion, Edge of Fate, it looks like we might have at least a vague answer: soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Fate seems subtle on this point, at first. Though the story is set on Kepler, a new location flung way out toward the edge of the solar system, it deals a lot with time-bending looks back into the past, and a few hints toward the future. You get your first hint about Chicago when Lodi, the expansion's new character, gets a glimpse of the future. He mentions standing with the Guardian, Destiny's player character, on the shores of Lake Michigan--the Great Lake on whose shores Chicago is found.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the train. The campaign's opening cutscene sees series mainstay Ikora Rey nearly getting run over by a subway train seemingly zapped across time to appear in Destiny 2's far-flung futuristic post-apocalypse. Trains are all over the expansion, acting as a story touchstone, a sort of reality-bending entry point for different areas in the new location of Kepler, and the expansion's defining image.</p><p dir="ltr">That train car sure looks like Chicago's "El" train, the elevated railway that runs throughout the city, once you're primed to look for it. And if you zoom in on the Edge of Fate key art, you can see the train's destination printed above the door. It says "Ravenswood," a north Chicago neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477"></a><figcaption>See that train car in the middle of the image?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But any sleuthing becomes unnecessary when things get really explicit later on, as you near the end of the campaign. In one of the final missions, Destiny 2 mainstay Ikora Rey literally says something to the effect of, "Maybe soon we'll go to Chicago."</p><p dir="ltr">Old Chicago is a big deal to Destiny players who have been around for a while. The location has been wondered about, discussed, and even teased for years. Bungie first dropped the possibility of visiting Old Chicago back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams" rel="nofollow ">before the original Destiny was even released</a>. Since then, references to the city have come up time and again in lore and story. When Bungie first showed off images of its 2022 expansion, The Witch Queen, players speculated the location in its first trailer might be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22518875/destiny-2-witch-queen-expansion-old-chicago-screenshot-tease" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the swampy outskirts of Chicago</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It'd be a significant location to visit, because while Destiny 2 has destinations set on Earth, they're fairly nondescript. The European Dead Zone, or EDZ, takes players to a destroyed, fictional European town called Trostland. There's also the Cosmodrome, an airplane and spaceship graveyard and control facility located somewhere in Russia. But both locations are invented for Destiny 2--they don't really reference anywhere specific from our world.</p><p dir="ltr">Chicago, on the other hand, <em>would</em> be a recognizable place from our reality, and it would be the first. While the old cities of Earth are all destroyed hundreds of years before the events of Destiny 2, surely the city will still <em>look</em> like the Chicago we expect, and seeing it in its ravaged, post-alien invasion state would be interesting in and of itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476"></a><figcaption>A cutscene during Edge of Fate's campaign shows a distant city that's also the location of the Department of External Observation. Based on the landscape and the highway sign, it could be Chicago.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd also be the first American location to get Destiny 2's futuristic treatment, so we'd get to see how Bungie might play with the city and change it through the course of both hundreds of years of progress and hundreds of years of decay. That's to say nothing of what gameplay opportunities the ravaged city might afford, or story implications of the possibility of any humans still eeking out a living there.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints within the Edge of Fate campaign that Chicago could be an important location as Destiny 2's story develops, too. Cutscenes in the expansion jump back in time to Earth in what appears to be the 1960s, and one includes a distant city skyline. That city is also the apparent location of the Department of External Observation, a government agency from the past focused on the possibility of alien contact and abduction, which plays a significant role in the expansion. So if Chicago is, in fact, a future destination, it seems very likely the DEO is too.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot of speculation, but it really seems like Edge of Fate is setting up Chicago as its next big destination. If that's the case, it'll be the culmination of waiting and speculation that's lasted all of Destiny's life--almost 12 years.</p>

                <p>After a three-year silence, a developer behind the ambitious Fallout: Bakersfield has revealed a new trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-1993/" data-ref-id="5000-815">Doom</a> total conversion mod that transforms id's shooter into the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a>, and it almost looks too good to be true.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin is one of the leading developers behind the project. The mod looks to recreate Fallout 1's Ghoul city of Necropolis as a FPS campaign using GZDoom, a modified version of Doom that supports modern features like dynamic lighting, high resolution textures, better rendering, and more not possible in id's original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's immediately clear that Berezin knows the look and feel of the first two Fallout games inside and out, as the new four-minute Fallout: Bakersfield trailer perfectly captures not only the visual style and aesthetic but also the tone of original Fallout games.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the trailer shows how Berezin has blended the iconography of Doom and Fallout seamlessly together, with a UI that is immediately reminiscent of Doom (complete with a guy's face in a little box in the middle of the screen) but brilliantly melded with the Pip-Boy aesthetics of Fallout. There's even a neon green text box in the left corner of the screen that displays environmental information and damage dealt, just like in the original Fallout.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod is a non-commercial project and will be playable for free, though it might still be a while before players can get their hands on it. The end of the trailer reveals various stats about the project and estimates it to be around 60% complete. A release date shown in the trailer flickers with various question marks that slowly transform into a year. While at first it looks like the year "2027" will be displayed, it quickly swaps back to a question mark, perhaps implying that Fallout: Bakersfield's release date is still in flux.</p><p dir="ltr">While the wait for Fallout: Bakersfield might be a long one, the wait for official new Fallout games may be longer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was reported to have been recently greenlit</a> but is likely still many years away. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-will-have-more-content-based-on-the-tv-show/1100-6533192/" data-ref-id="1100-6533192">Fallout 76 will continue to receive new content</a> based on Amazon's popular Fallout TV show, which recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">wrapped production on season 2</a>.</p>

                <p>2023's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still getting new updates, and the next one is a big one. Ubisoft has announced that a major new update coming to the game this December will add a third-person mode and New Game Plus. The update releases on December 5, which is just ahead of the release of the next movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, on December 19.</p><p>The third-person mode allows players to see the world of Pandora from a new perspective. Ubisoft said the team at Massive Entertainment "reworked" the game's animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to support the third-person view.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bej3ockJuIc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bej3ockJuIc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The New Game Plus, meanwhile, gives players a reason to replay the story. As with other New Game+ modes, players can opt to replay the campaign while keeping their inventory and skills. The New Game+ mode also adds a new skill tree and introduces "more powerful gear."</p><p>Frontiers of Pandora is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/ubisoftplus?ucid=SCH-ID_175081&amp;maltcode=ubisoft+_convst_SCH_googlesearch___UPLUS____&amp;addinfo=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20621383368&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcmFnQXx0CNTtgQ0U8M7ptbbqct7&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyvfDBhDYARIsAItzbZETmwO0JwfXo3hepGdZFgvuMZAFRrkfJXqJw0X4NCWecXZODL_z-XEaApxCEALw_wcB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up to Ubisoft+</a> to get the game as part of the subscription service.</p><p>Fire and Ash, meanwhile, is the newest entry in James Cameron's Avatar film series. It has big shoes to fill, as the 2009 original Avatar ($2.923 billion) and its 2022 sequel The Way of Water ($2.320 billion) are the No. 1 and No. 3 highest-grossing movies of all time, respectively.</p>

                <p>Despite the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a> not yet being officially announced, EA and DICE have now confirmed an open beta for Battlefield 6. Not only is an open beta coming, but the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Battlefield account said</a> the game's beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734">Each class in Battlefield 6 will have signature weapons</a>, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-battlefield-6-could-be-revealed-and-its-soon/1100-6533290/" data-ref-id="1100-6533290">officially unveiled on July 31, according to a report</a>, and it's also at this time that DICE may share more details about the open beta. Online speculation suggests the open beta could begin in August, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Battlefield 6, which is scheduled to launch by March 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">As always, a new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass packed with cosmetics. There will likely be more Black Ops 6 events and crossovers as well. Season 4 was cartoon-themed with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/">American Dad</a> collaborations, but it's uncertain what theme could arrive with Season 5. Call of Duty has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-operator-knows-what-you-did-last-summer/1100-6533292/">operator collab is the Fisherman</a> from I Know What You Did Last Summer, so this could be Season 5's first crossover news, but it's possible the operator bundle arrives before Season 4 ends.</p><p dir="ltr">The new weapons haven't been officially revealed, but <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog/status/1940450354266800365" rel="nofollow ">leaks suggest</a> Season 5 could include the return of the iconic MP-40 submachine gun and the M60 light machine gun. The game files also mention melee weapons such as the chainsaw, boxing gloves, and brass knuckles. Of course, these are weapons that could be saved for another season or scrapped all together.</p><p dir="ltr">The operator Sims was also found in the recent game files, suggesting he could be the Season 5 battle pass operator.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535417"></a><figcaption>Zombies crew in Shattered Veil cutscene</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4535417-19610c617ef50-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 multiplayer will likely feature new maps and game modes in Season 5, but we don't have those details yet. As for Zombies, the most recent Call of Duty podcast episode confirmed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final map will launch with Season 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This brings a conclusion to the ongoing storyline for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">Shattered Veil main quest</a>, the Zombies crew and Edward Richtofen will face off against S.A.M. in a setting that takes place in or around the Janus Towers location of Liberty Falls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk returned in Season 3, and the map has slowly evolved to mimic updates of the original map. This added the moving train, opened up the Train Station interior, and included several Easter eggs. While not confirmed, Stadium's rooftop is expected to open up with Season 5 and include playable areas for the interior. Data miners also found <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1940521748715471055" rel="nofollow ">references in the game files</a> to back up the speculation, with new map locations for a boardroom and computer room within Stadium. There's also mention of some type of lockdown for Stadium. It's uncertain if this is a location, event, or tied to an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is officially announced, and a full reveal is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month</a>, but it's possible there could still be some sort of in-game Warzone event tied to the big announcement. Warzone events have been used in the past to create hype around new Call of Duty releases.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Season 5 trailer, more teasers, and a full roadmap will likely arrive near the start of August, and we'll update as new information releases.</p>

                <p>Switching between playing games on different Xbox devices is about to get a little easier, as Microsoft has introduced a new Play History feature that makes it simple to see what games you've played across any Xbox device.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/21/now-available-for-xbox-insiders-your-cross-device-play-history-and-easier-access-to-your-cloud-playable-console-games-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the new feature will start rolling out today for Xbox Insiders. On the Xbox device's homescreen, a new list titled "Jump Back in" will appear with games that have been played recently on your current device. This is basically how it already works on consoles, with the tiles displaying recently used games and apps, but is new to the Xbox PC app.</p><p dir="ltr">New to both consoles and PC devices is the "Play History" button.
