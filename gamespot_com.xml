                <p>The rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">a Simpsons-themed season of Fortnite</a> began earlier this year, but it's been picking up steam in the last few weeks. Now, some apparent leaks have revealed which Simpsons characters will be in the battle pass, and what fans can expect from the map of Springfield.</p><p>According to this leak, the battle pass includes Homer Simpson and his wife, Marge Simpson. Ned Flanders appears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">confirm a previous rumor</a>, but there's no sign of Bart, Lisa, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-add-moe-from-the-simpsons-in-next-major-update-it-seems/1100-6535664/" data-ref-id="1100-6535664">Moe</a>. Instead, Peely Remix and Fishsticks Remix round out the battle pass. A <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20306" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kang and Kodos UFO glider</a> has been found, but it was also left out of the battle pass.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">map of Springfield</a> has also unofficially dropped, and it appears to be a collection of landmarks from the Simpsons' hometown themed over a traditional Fortnite island rather than a complete map of the city.</p><p>A few of the recognizable locations on the map include Evergreen Terrace, Springfield's town square, the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns' manor, Krusty Burger, and the Duff Brewery. Another leak suggests that Fortnite will begin the build up to the new season later today by placing Bart's treehouse in the game.</p><p>A short Fortnite season will launch on November 1, but Epic Games has yet to confirm it will be The Simpsons-themed season. The Simpsons TV series is closing in on its 40th anniversary in 2029, but the characters have been largely absent from consoles for almost two decades. Recently, a team of modders revisited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-and-run/" data-ref-id="5000-18218">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> and turned it into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simpsons-hit-run-designer-loves-fan-made-futurama-re-skin/1100-6535602/" data-ref-id="1100-6535602">Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</a>. The Simpsons Movie 2 is also scheduled to release in 2027.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6's mysterious, but confirmed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode</a> could release as soon as next week as a shadowdrop. That's according to a datamining effort and information from sources.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1981663452465955165" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming</a> said the battle royale mode will shadowdrop on October 28. As for the datamining details, something called "Granite" has reportedly been discovered in the Battlefield 6 game files. <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981108370502537707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Modern Warzone</a>, meanwhile, reported that this is the battle royale mode and it is indeed coming on October 28 as a shadowdrop.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has confirmed it's working on a battle royale mode but has not shared specifics about it yet, including whether it will be free or paid. It wouldn't be the first shadowdrop of a battle royale game, as EA released Apex Legends back in February 2019 without much pre-release hype.</p><p>EA tried its hand at the battle royale space for Battlefield years ago with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-5-firestorm-gameplay-new-battle-royale/1100-6465748/" data-ref-id="1100-6465748">Firestorm mode for Battlefield V back in 2019.</a> The mode didn't exactly catch on, however. The new Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will go up against titles like Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone, and others.</p><p>EA has been testing Battlefield 6's battle royale mode with the Battlefield Labs testing community. The developer just recently provided an overview of some of the changes for battle royale. These include (<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by EA</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>October 28 is also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6's Season 1 arrives</a>, ushering in new maps and modes for multiplayer.</p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a good start following its release on October 10, selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">7 million copies right away</a>, representing the "biggest opening" of all time for the series.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A Review - A Battle Revolution</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is the second Pokemon Legends game. In early 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-reaches-6-5-million-players-in-one-week/1100-6500315/">Pokemon Legends Arceus sold 6.5 million copies in its first week</a>, outpacing Pokemon Legends: Z-A so far. At the time, that was the best debut ever for a Pokemon game.

This would be no surprise, given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Bethesda first revealed it was making Fallout 5 years ago.</a></p><p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IZm-Hws334" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallout Day broadcast</a>, Howard said the team is aware that fans want to see more Fallout.

                <p>The convergence of AI and game creation is a topic that won't be going away any time soon, especially when large companies like EA reportedly wants its devs to consider artificial intelligence to be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" when crafting titles. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was recently asked about Xbox's AI usage, and he indicated that it's primarily being utilized for operational purposes for now.</p><p>"Our applications of AI today are mostly actually on the security and protection of our networks," said Spencer during his appearance at the Paley International Council Summit (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). "It's now at a scale where you can't really moderate the safety of those with just people alone. The volume is too high. So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. That's our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn't the most glamorous use of AI, but it's something that I fundamentally believe in."</p><p>As a company, Microsoft is going all in on AI and voice controls with a recently unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">campaign to fully integrate that technology into Windows 11 machines</a>. In the video game industry, prominent developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation. A recent survey also found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI</a> in some way.</p><p>Spencer did address whether Microsoft encourages developers to use AI in the creative process, and he noted that he prefers to let the devs make that decision.</p><p>"I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier," said Spencer. "Any top-down mandate that 'thou must use a certain tool' ... is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate."</p><p>A recent report indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Microsoft's extremely ambitious profit goals</a> may be harming the company, and possibly played a large role in its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">massive layoffs</a>, as well as the price hikes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>. It was also disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-makes-480-times-as-much-as-the-median-company-worker-a-growing-gap/1100-6535651/" data-ref-id="1100-6535651">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made $96.5 million</a> in the company's 2025 fiscal year. That's approximately 480 times as much as the median company worker at Microsoft.</p>
