                <p>If the internet has taught me anything, its that Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 are two games folks simply cannot get enough of, myself included. Fortunately, a newly-released, fan-made mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Village</a>, combines the two in a pretty spectacular way. With the Baldur's Village mod, Stardew players can add 20+ characters, six new locations, new shops, new items, and new events, all inspired by Baldur's Gate 3, to the popular farming sim.</p><p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," the mods description reads. "You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent."</p><p>After venturing up north, players will be greeted by an entirely new area occupied by several familiar faces, including Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and everyone's favorite, blood-sucking aristocrat, Astarion. Currently, Astarion is the only new neighbor players will be able to romance, as he is the only one the team has finished designing heart events and gift preferences for. However, the team has confirmed that its next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline, followed by expanding world-building background stories and gameplay features.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4456696,1300-4456697,1300-4456698,1300-4456699,1300-4456700,1300-4456701,1300-4456702,1300-4456703,1300-4456704,1300-4456705" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"></figure><p>In order to get the Baldur's Village mod up and running, players will also need to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Modding API</a> (SMAPI), the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Valley Content Patcher</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portraiture mod</a>, all of which can be downloaded for free over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Players already using Stardew Valley mods might already have these downloaded, as several of the game's most popular mods require SMAPI and the Content Patcher to run. Once the mod is installed, players need not worry about starting a new game to experience the Baldur's Gate bliss--the mod should seamlessly integrate the new content into existing save files.</p><p>Despite launching less than 24 hours ago, Baldur's Village is already proving to be a very popular mod, with nearly 90,000 views and 12,000 total downloads as of writing. Considering mods have played a pivotal role in keeping both Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 fresh and exciting for repeat players, the success of Baldur's Village is exciting yet hardly surprising.</p><p>Interested in more mod recommendations from GameSpot?

                <p>Directors Neil Druckmann and Alex Garland sat down for a wide-ranging and fascinating chat recently where they discussed their professional careers. There is some overlap, of course, as Druckmann's The Last of Us franchise and Garland's 28 Days Later are themed around a virus that leads to epic societal collapse. In the discussion, Garland said he's sure The Last of Us (2013) is better than 28 Days Later (2002), at least in terms of the writing.</p><p>"The Last of Us is better than 28 Days Later, or at least the writing is. I know what 28 Days is. I know what I did. I know what the process was," he said in an <a href="https://youtu.be/iJUab499PVA?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview for Sony</a>. "The thing about The Last of Us was I was like, 'Oh this is like so much more sophisticated and moving.' I'm not dissing 28 Days Later. It's a nice part of my life. But seriously, The Last of Us is on another level."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>28 Days Later was directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle and stars Cillian Murphy. The film 28 Weeks Later followed in 2007, with 28 Years Later coming this June. Boyle and Garland were less involved with the sequel, but are coming back to direct and write 28 Years Later, respectively, for this summer.</p><p>Garland is also known for writing and directing Annihilation, Ex Machina, Civil War, and Men.</p><p>The Last of Us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-bet-on-there-being-a-last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6529927/" data-ref-id="1100-6529927">may never get a third installment in the game series</a>, but the franchise's next gaming release is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/" data-ref-id="1100-6528451">PC launch of The Last of Us 2 Remastered in April</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">There could be an official Xbox-branded handheld out by the end of this year. A new report states that Microsoft is partnering with a PC gaming company, like ASUS or Lenovo, on the device, with a targeted launch in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="nofollow ">WindowsCentral</a>, the handheld is codenamed Keenan and will be similar in nature to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-windows-handheld-preorders-are-live-steamos-model-releases-in-may/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>--which will be the first device outside the Steam Deck family to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">run on Valve's SteamOS</a>. So, the Xbox-branded handheld will likely run on Windows, featuring the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. The report also states the system will likely sport an Xbox guide button and aesthetics that fit the Xbox ethos.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">Phil Spencer mentioned an Xbox handheld is a "few years out"</a> in November. (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-thinks-xbox-should-have-a-handheld/1100-6524107/">Spencer, for his part, has teased making an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, too.) This longer-term plan lines up with the report of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">the next Xbox launching in 2027</a>. Basically, Microsoft plans to kick off the next generation with a Xbox Series X successor accompanied by an internally developed handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr">However, unsurprisingly, it's noted that this schedule could shift as Microsoft works on the future of the Xbox brand. For instance, WindowsCentral points to the Xbox-licensed handheld scheduled for this year to serve as sort of a test drive for Microsoft. There is also no specific details on the partnering company, which could also be Razer or MSI.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted Microsoft seeking comment on this report.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/">a Call of Duty leaker claimed the next Xbox is planned for 2026</a>. One aspect that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">Spencer has touched on is that the next Xbox hardware must be more innovative</a>.</p>

                <p>Last week AMD launched FSR 4 alongside its first RDNA 4-equipped desktop GPUs. It's a drastic improvement over previous versions of the tech suite, introducing AI-powered upscaling that is only possible thanks to dedicated hardware on the new cards. It's an advancement that Sony's Mark Cerny is saying will come to PS5, albeit not until 2026.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>, Cerny was full of praise for AMD's FSR 4 release, saying that the upscaler surpasses the work Sony has done with its PS5 Pro-exclusive solution, PSSR. "And results are excellent, it's a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR," Cerny explained. "I'm very proud of the work of the joint team!"</p><p>Cerny says that FSR 4 will need to be backported to the PS5 Pro, essentially through a new version of PSSR that takes into account all the advancements AMD has made. Cerny says that for the most part the information the upscaler requires from a game will stay the same, which will make implementation by developers easier, but that it isn't as easy as supporting FSR 4 natively. This is due to the PS5 Pro having an entirely different architecture than RDNA 4, and thus not one that can support it fully like AMD's latest GPUs.</p><p>"RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in FSR 4," Cerny continued. "I'm definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability."</p><p>FSR 4 doesn't have the same performance gains as its previous iteration, in part due to the additional overhead required for the vastly improved results. Cerny, however, believes the PS5 Pro can still support these image improvements despite the much weaker hardware in the PS5 Pro, without requiring major re-architecture. "That is what we are targeting, and we believe we can achieve it," Cerny added.</p><p>Sony and AMD continue to collaborate on Project Amethyst, with its first major milestone coming with the release of PSSR. Cerny believes there's a lot more to come by working closely with AMD, especially when it comes to machine learning and ray tracing enhancements for future console hardware.

                <p>Developer Psyonix has announced a futuristic theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> Season 18, with this new season kicking off on March 14. The season brings a new battle pass, a high-tech new arena, more Mutators, and another way to report toxic players.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 18 features free and premium tiers in the battle pass, and one of the highlights is the Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack car body in the paid tiers. This new car body is unlocked instantly for all players who purchase the premium pass. Other items in the premium pass include the modern Azura car body and accessories, such as the Space Tower Antenna, Spaceship Topper, and the Waypoint Trail.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C21PH5cISok" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C21PH5cISok" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond just cosmetics, Season 18 also features a new arena for players to experience. The brand new Futura Garden arena includes a design with towering, futuristic architecture. You can get a first look at Futura Garden in the trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">The season adds additional Mutators to give players new ways to play in Exhibition mode and private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 18 includes the following new Mutation options:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Jumps:</strong> Take to the skies by increasing the number of jumps you can do at once! Do a double-jump, triple-jump, octuple-jump… Or, turn jumps off entirely and keep the competition ground level. ⁠</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Number of Balls:</strong> Why have just one soccar ball when you could have six? Choose between having one, two, four, or six balls in play.⁠</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ball Gravity:</strong> Alter the ball's gravitational pull and let the mayhem ensue. Options include low, high, super, and good ol’ fashioned default.⁠</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dodge Timer: </strong>Change the time allowed between dodges. Dial things up to unlimited and avoid ANY obstacle!⁠</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Possession Score: </strong>Shake up the game by allowing players to score points just for staying in control of the ball.⁠</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Demolish Score:</strong> Bring on the destruction! Allow players to score up to three points for each demolition.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Normal Goal Score:</strong> Go for the goal like never before. Increase the points earned for each successful shot in the back of the net!</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Aerial Goal Score: </strong>Look out below! Increase how much you can score for each successful airborne shot.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Assist Score: </strong>Teamwork is the key to victory. Allow players to earn up to three points for each assist.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Enforce Territories:</strong> Get back on your side! This mutator enables the Split Shot wall, dividing teams across each half of the field. Players will be demolished if they touch the ground on the opponents' side.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">To help combat toxicity, Rocket League is expanding player reporting to include voice reporting. ⁠Voice reporting means in addition to being able to block, mute, and report other players, there will be an option to submit audio evidence when reporting suspected violations of the game's community rules.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also teases the Season 18 competitive rewards will be disco-themed items, including items like the Disco Ball Boost and Disco Party Goal Explosion.</p><p dir="ltr">Rocket league Season 18 runs from March 14 to June 18, and more details about the season can be found on the <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-18-springs-forth-futura-garden" rel="nofollow ">official Rocket League blog post</a>.</p>

Priced at $1,583--or 1,395 Swiss Francs so be prepared for some exchange rate fluctuations--the "<a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-int/h13605130-american-classic-boulton-titanium-death-stranding-two.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqM0R64A0wWo2VHBaQF56wxY2T0G97-HDK-LblpbMHuuTjP8Tj1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Classic Boulton: Death Stranding 2 Limited Edition</a>" watch is a pretty good-looking piece of equipment even without its links to the video game.</p><p>Limited to 2,000 pieces, it features a full titanium case, automatic mechanical movement, and seven different pieces of sapphire glass, so it might survive one or two Timefall sessions if you ever find yourself stuck in a Death Stranding apocalypse.</p><p>Hamilton is also a very renowned brand--especially its military-grade watches--and several of its pieces have popped up in Christopher Nolan-directed films like Interstellar and Oppenheimer. If you're looking to grab one yourself, it'll be on sale starting June 26, just in time for the launch of Death Stranding 2.</p><p>This isn't the first time that the worlds of Death Stranding and fashion have met, as Kojima Productions and Jean-Francois Rey collaborated on a pair of Ludens Mask sunglasses. These were limited to 888 pieces and sold for over $530 when they were first released, and as of now, <em>all </em>of them have sold out. For something more functional, Kojima Productions and Acronym once teamed up to create a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-functional-death-stranding-jacket-will-cost-y/1100-6476221/" data-ref-id="1100-6476221">Bridges staff jacket that looked comfy</a> and utilitarian in its design.</p><p>The only catch here? The price once again, as this jacket sold for $1,900 when it was first released. It's no longer available, but there are some <em>astonishing </em>listings on eBay, where people have it listed for an astronomical price.</p>
