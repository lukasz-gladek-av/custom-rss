                <p>Who doesn't love a little DIY arts and crafts project? They're fun, they get you doing something, and most of the time, you'll come out of it with something special, or at least a fun story. Unfortunately, this is the story of one fan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> project gone horribly wrong, and while it can't be fun for the poor guy at the center of it, watching it unfold sure has been pretty funny.</p><p>Recently, a TikTok user (<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-yellow-spray-paint-cart-1851786727?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) by the name of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gardner</a> shared that they wanted to paint their Switch 2 cartridge of the critically acclaimed 3D platformer yellow. The rationale behind the move is a simple one rooted in nostalgia: Nintendo has previously released Donkey Kong games with banana-yellow cartridges, like Donkey Kong 64, which Gardner flashes on camera as a reference point in the first of two videos.</p><p>I can already hear everyone groaning and screaming at their screens. I was there too, but it's worth it to enjoy the rest of this cringe-inducing ride.</p><p>Gardner then proceeds to crudely pry apart the crimson red Switch 2 cartridge, showing multiple failed approaches before it is finally cracked open. Once it is, they remove the card with the game files on it and take the spray paint can to each half of the cartridge casing. The first video ends as they piece it back together and insert the game in the console only to find it gets stuck about halfway through and can't actually fit back into the slot.</p><p>One comment on the first video reads, "Seems like the paint might melt and stick in the system when it heats up. This feels like a bad idea." If only that commenter knew how right they'd be within just 24 hours.</p><p>To make matters worse, Gardner returned with a second video a day later showing that despite the system's resistance to the painted-over case, they insistently jammed the game in anyways, where it is now irretrievably stuck. They even take a pair of pliers to the system but simply cannot pull it out, instead chipping the yellow paint and even breaking the cartridge. Eventually Gardner relents, hilariously saying, "Without tagging Nintendo, somebody let me know what I should do to get it out of my system. Again, I'm chilling because I'm going to play the game for a while but I'd love your suggestions."</p><p>As you might expect, Gardner's ridiculous journey for a yellow Bananza cartridge has already gone viral. Some chimed in with what they believed to be advice, like multiple comments suggesting they should've just 3D printed a yellow case and reprinted the game's art, but many of the commenters are also just poking fun at Gardner's dedication and misfortune.</p><p>One comment simply reads, "It's NOT THAT SERIOUS," alongside a crying emoji. Another jokes, "Guy buys a Switch 2 with Donkey Kong built in!!!" The most devastating of the bunch simply says, "Is now a bad time to mention it isn't even the right shade of yellow?" Ouch.</p><p>I guess the big takeaway here is that the next time you want to undertake a DIY project with your expensive gaming system, please just ask around the internet before doing a very costly amount of damage. I hope they're really enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza, because that seems to be the only thing that Switch 2 is going to be playing for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p>Developer 1047 Games has made some drastic announcements about the Splitgate series, confirming today that Splitgate 2 is reverting to beta and the servers for the original Splitgate are going offline.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, the developer's co-founders said they agree with the sentiment from many fans that the game was released into a 1.0 state too soon. "We've heard your feedback, and we agree with you: We launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew."</p><p>The studio went on to admit that some features were "rushed" and that the team made some "boneheaded mistakes," which could be a reference to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l8yux9/comment/mx8l8fe/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">overpriced microtransactions</a> or an executive's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">wear a certain hat on stage at Summer Game Fest. </a></p><p>"So we're going back to beta. We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special," the developer said.</p><p>Splitgate 2's progression system will be reworked "from he ground up," while maps will get more portals, the monetization systems will be simplified, and the game overall will be refocused on "classic game modes."</p><p>1047 Games said it will conduct playtests, issue surveys, and listen to fan feedback as it seeks to grow and improve on Splitgate 2. "Our goal is to combine the DNA of the first game with the best improvements from the second. Rebuilding the core experience isn't a quick fix; it's a long-term commitment," the developer said.</p><p>Despite what sounds like a major development effort from the part of 1047 Games, the studio is cutting roles. "To give ourselves the time to build the Splitgate you deserve, we've made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles and shift our resources to focus on this rework," the studio said.</p><p>"This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today. They're receiving severance and job placement support, and we're committed to doing everything we can to help them through this transition," the studio added. "We hope to bring them back when we can."</p><p>Additionally, the servers for the original Splitgate are closing as part of an "effort to retain as many team members as possible."</p><p>"While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team," the company explained. "Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches. And when we return, we plan to have a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original."</p><p>Splitgate 2 will remain playable through the rework, and the planned Chapter 3 update is still coming, along with the scheduled fixes and changes.</p><p>"We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible," the developer said. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up. We love this game, and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won't."</p>

The clip is also themed heavily around the location of Avalon, leading players to once again speculate that it could be the location of Warzone's next map.</p><p dir="ltr">As seen in the video below, the Season 4's outro shows Woods and Adler preparing to leave Avalon. Pantheon has collapsed, and the team is fully pardoned and ready to go home. Woods is on a call with Sev, who says she's not leaving with them. She's going to stay in Avalon and guide local factions now that Pantheon is gone.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1947688085824934141" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">"I thought you were done working from the shadows..."<br>With the codenames finally cracked, Pantheon has collapsed. Woods and his team are coming home to finish the job... with one exception. The future of Avalon is unwritten. <a href="https://t.co/3jrEhKDBbh" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/3jrEhKDBbh</a></p>  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1947688085824934141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's seasonal outro cutscenes usually tease a continuation of post-launch story for the next season, so some players are suggesting this could be a teaser to confirm the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">long-rumored Avalon map</a> for Season 5 of Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a fictional city featured in the Black Ops 6 campaign, and it's also been teased in post-launch content. It's possible the developer has a surprise up its sleeve for Warzone, but most likely the Season 4 story outro is teasing a continuation of Black Op 6's post-launch narrative that is meant to tie into Black Ops 7 and build hype for the new game. This could just be a tease that we'll see some of Sev's impact on Avalon in the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has confirmed that part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">Black Ops 7's campaign takes place in Avalon</a>, which was discussed on a recent Call of Duty podcast episode and shut down speculation that the Black Ops 7 reveal trailer was teasing Avalon as the next Warzone map. The clip in question showed a scene with a squad flying down onto Avalon with wingsuits, mimicking a drop into a match of battle royale. According to the podcast host, the scene is part of Black Ops 7's co-op campaign set on Avalon, which will support up to four players.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, they also didn't outright confirm the Avalon content wasn't also developed for Warzone, and it's worth noting that Call of Duty battle royale maps often include campaign and multiplayer locations. This means Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 could potentially still feature the rumored Warzone map at some point, but it's unlikely to launch at the end of Black Ops 6's cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-devs-shows-off-faithful-recreation-of-verdansk/1100-6530323/" data-ref-id="1100-6530323">rebuilt from the ground up</a> as a collaboration between several Call of Duty studios, so a lot of time and resources went into bringing this map back, making it unlikely to have such a brief return. Data miners have also found new information in the game files to suggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/">Verdansk's Stadium POI will be updated</a> in Season 5 to open up as a playable area, much like the map's original update in 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll learn more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">Black Ops 7 with the full game reveal</a> scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month. It's possible the Black Ops 7 reveal will also include details about the future of Warzone.</p>

The event will run from July 23 to August 6 and features tons of unique content to complement the hottest time of the year.</p><p>As is typical, the event will run in-game for about two weeks and kick off with new summer-themed quests, but the big festival itself will take place in the Grand Hub. That means that players need to have at least reached Hunter Rank 16 to access the social area, which was added to the Wilds' in its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunts-wilds-first-title-update-adds-grand-hub-new-monsters-and-more/1100-6530343/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvsOKq_9COAxVyFFkFHW3ABGEQFnoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fllxHNqNxGFHEZgIYb1VH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first title update</a> this spring.</p><p>The Grand Hub will be redecorated and feature a new summer-themed meal as well as playable minigames, like throwing a beach ball around. Additionally, there's a water gun emote that briefly turns Monster Hunter Wilds into a third-person Super Soaker shooter, and Capcom seems to be encouraging players to party up and throw down in the Grand Hub throughout the festival.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf0Xw15oLHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf0Xw15oLHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the event trailer, it seems like there will also be fireworks and some kind of performance to catch in the Grand Hub. Participation in the Flamefete Festival and login bonuses throughout the two-week run will give players a whole host of extra goodies, like Seikret decorations and craftable gear for hunters and their Palicos that adopts a fiery aesthetic.</p><p>Outside of the festival grounds, there will be two new event quests that appear to add a skintight diving suit made from the skin of the poisonous Rompopolo monster and another that will yield a joke weapon called the Cornpopper, which is essentially a gunlance that looks like a huge corncob. Most previous event quests will also be returning during the festival.</p><p>If all of that leaves folks feeling particularly thirsty, the summer festival update is also adding new swimwear outfits for the hunter as well as many supporting NPCs, including Alma, Erik, and Gemma. Players can buy a DLC pack beginning July 23 that permanently unlocks these cosmetics outside of the event. Speaking of NPCs, this update also allows Fabius, who acts as the leader of Wilds' core members of the Hunting Guild, to join the hunter in the field as an ally.</p><p>The Flamefete Festival launches on July 23 alongside the arrival of the Arch-tempered Uth Duna, both of which are part of the RPG's second free title update.</p>

The game debuts on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it's coming to Switch 2 on October 3, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said in a <a href="https://x.com/duvalmagic/status/1947702377185763768?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post.</a></p><p>Some had theorized or feared that Borderlands 4's Switch 2 version might release later in 2025 or possibly in 2026, but that's not going to be the case. Gearbox and 2K Games said from the start that Borderlands 4 would not come to Switch 2 alongside the other versions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6kiYmQrr9U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C6kiYmQrr9U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>An episode of Creator's Voice from Nintendo about Borderlands 4 confirmed that the Switch 2 version was made in-house at Gearbox as opposed to being produced by an outside developer.</p><p>"When you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends ... it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4," Pitchford said.</p><p>The Switch 2 is not as powerful a console as the PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, but Pitchford said the Switch 2 is "very powerful" and is "an incredible machine in a very tight form factor." It remains to be seen, however, what kinds of differences there could be between versions of Borderlands 4.</p><p>"We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can," Pitchford said of the Switch 2.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-has-been-announced-and-its-lower-than-some-expected/1100-6532450/" data-ref-id="1100-6532450">priced at $70</a> on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but Gearbox is selling a number of premium editions that scale in price up to $150.
