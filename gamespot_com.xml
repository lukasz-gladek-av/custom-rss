                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is an easy contender for that coveted game of the year award, having been received incredibly well by critics and players alike. But as with any breakout success from a brand-new studio, there unfortunately comes an annoying question: What's next? Developer Sandfall Interactive is still staying mostly quiet on that front, but in a recent interview with game director Guillaume Broche, it has been at least confirmed that Expedition 33 will not be the only Clair Obscur game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to YouTuber MrMattyPlays (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>), Broche explained that "Clair Obscur is the franchise name. Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4ZEP5kjw-w4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Broche played it understandably coy here, as Expedition 33 only came out in April this year. With how long game development takes--and with Broche noting in this interview that he wants to keep the team relatively small going forward--we probably won't know what a potential sequel looks like. The game is quite notably inspired by the Final Fantasy series, which generally takes an anthological approach to its releases, so there are still questions over whether a Clair Obscur sequel would be a direct follow-up, or something new entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're yet to try out the game for yourself, and you're looking for a helping hand in figuring out if it's for you or not, then you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> for more.</p>

      </div>
<p>Considering that even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-mobile-now-supports-60-fps-on-some-device/1100-6463504/" data-ref-id="1100-6463504">Fortnite on mobile is supported with 60 FPS</a>, bumping that up to 90 sounds impressive. Even in Destiny 2 for PS5 during Crucible runs, it can reach up to 120fps, but PvE typically drops to 60fps, which still looks great. As for players on Android, it seems it'll be 60fps, but at least the game features full cross-play between all mobile platforms.</p><p>Pre-download will be available today, with the game launching at 9 AM local time across four regional servers: North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.</p><p>Destiny: Rising is the latest installment in the Destiny franchise, expanding upon its well-established universe. Set in a solar system following a major collapse, the game chronicles the ongoing conflict between Guardians and emerging threats tied to a mysterious force known as The Shroud.</p><p>There have been over 10 million players who have pre-registered so far. Players can expect new subclasses, expanded gear customization, and a broader array of missions and world events.</p>

                <p>When you think Ubisoft, you usually think about its tentpole franchises like Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six Siege, but the company has also released several great small-scale games across PC, console, and mobile. Some of these IP have been dormant for years, but Atari has inked a new deal to acquire five Ubisoft classics and bring them to modern platforms.</p><p>As part of the deal, Atari has purchased the IP for Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Grow Home, Grow Up, and Child of Eden. These were all one-off games (save for Grow Home and Grow Up) published by Ubisoft and developed by numerous teams, but in terms of console releases, most of them remained locked to Xbox 360 and PS3. Aside from their PC, Xbox 360, and PC releases.</p><p>"Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for longtime players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time," Ubisoft VP of New Business Deborah Papiernik said in a press statement (via <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BusinessWire</a>). "Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, and we're excited to see how they'll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways."</p><p>Atari has picked a solid collection of games, as I Am Alive offered a tense survival experience in a post-apocalyptic world, Cold Fear played like The Thing meets Resident Evil, and the Grow games are delightful platformers. Child of Eden is the real draw here, as the 2011 game from Tetris Effect director Tetsuya Mizuguchi was a music-powered rail-shooter that appealed to fans of the developer's previous work on Rez and Lumines.</p><p>Meanwhile, Atari has been on a strategic tear lately with acquisitions. It recently became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-creator-acquired-by-atari-in-5-million-deal/1100-6533517/" data-ref-id="1100-6533517">the majority owner of Thunderful Group</a>--the company behind the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steamworld-build/">SteamWorld games</a>--and the last couple of years saw it double down on its retro focus by acquiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-buys-studio-that-makes-very-good-atari-games-and-remasters/1100-6518773/">Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse</a>, both of which specialize in remasters of classic games. Atari also purchased the rights to the Transport Tycoon IP <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-buys-ancient-rival-intellivision-insists-the-amico-is-still-coming/1100-6523679/">and its former rival, Intellivision</a>.</p><p>This isn't the only legacy gaming brand making a big comeback lately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/acclaim-is-coming-back-as-game-publisher-focused-on-reviving-classic-franchises/1100-6529576/">as Acclaim was revived last year</a>. The company has pledged to support indie developers and "reignite" classic franchises, and on September 10, Acclaim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/play-acclaim-showcase-is-coming-in-september/1100-6534289/">will show what it's working on with a dedicated showcase event</a>.</p><p>As for Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/">it's refocusing some its efforts with a new subsidiary</a>--funded in part by Tencent--that will be led by Ubisoft Montreal veteran Christophe Derennes and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's own son, Charlie Guillemot.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We're about a month out from the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" data-ref-id="5000-654978">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and later this week Sega is offering up another opportunity for you to try out the game through its latest Open Network Test--and an opportunity to see if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-still-doesnt-feel-like-it-has-an-identity-of-its-own/1100-6534251/" data-ref-id="1100-6534251">come away from it feeling better than us</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A new trailer shared on the official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel provided a nice overview of what you can expect from this latest beta test for the game, including how long it's running, and what kind of customization options will be available.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LX_P9EkIbU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6LX_P9EkIbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3 dir="ltr">When does the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test start?</h3><p dir="ltr">The exact dates the network test kicks off depends on where exactly you're located. In the US, for those in a PT timezone, it's running from August 28 to September 1, whereas in the ET timezone, the UK, and Japan, it's running from August 29 to September 1--it's all at the same time; the dates just differ because of timezone differences.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Start Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">August 28, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">August 29, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">End Date</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">September 1, 9 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">September 2, 12 AM ET / 4 AM UTC / 1 PM JST</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">How can I sign up to the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">All you need to do is head to your platform of choice, which includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0177-PPSA30664_00-SONICRACINGCWONT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9PGDMMC6QGGP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/sonic-racing-crossworlds-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-7aec63" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic</a>, and download the Open Network Test through their respective storefronts. After that, you'll be able to play! You can already preload the test ahead of its start time this week.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What's included in the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test?</h3><p dir="ltr">There's quite a lot available in the test, notably nine whole courses to choose from and zip through like Metal Harbour, Mystic Jungle, and Colorful Mall. Amongst all of those there are also seven CrossWorlds to get transported to while you're racing, such as Magma Planet and Holoska.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll have 12 characters to play as, obviously including Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow, and on August 31 you'll also be able to play as Persona 5's Joker--more on that in a moment. The test will feature 21 vehicles across five different types, and you'll have 42 gadgets to modify your playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of modes, there's the standard Grand Prix, which typically contains four races in one cup, World Match--which sees you racing online against 11 other players and features a World Rank you can increase--and Time Trials, a mode that lets you race for the best time on various tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the Joker Festival, which starts August 31 and runs for 24 hours from 12:01 AM ET. The event sees players split into three different teams, where you can earn points and Persona-themed titles. Whichever team comes out on top at the end of the event will also win an exclusive title. It is probably worth noting that save data does not carry over to the full game, however.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the technical details, you also don't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass subscription to play online, though to play the World Match and Festival modes on Nintendo Switch you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Cross-play is also enabled for the network test.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out September 25, and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
