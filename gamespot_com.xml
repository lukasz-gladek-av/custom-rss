                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/" data-ref-id="1100-6530614">Zelda Notes app</a> includes a way to fix your damaged equipment in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> for Switch 2--if you're lucky. The weapon-degradation fix is tied to the free app's daily bonus feature, which gives you a random item or effect once each day.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo highlighted the feature during one of its lengthy Treehouse Live segments following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Direct</a>, and the bonus roulette included things such as meal effects, energy-cell restoration, and stamina recovery. However, Zelda YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeltik </a>spotted two additional bonuses during a hands-on with Breath of the Wild's and Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 versions--equipment repair and bow repair.</p><p dir="ltr">The roulette didn't land on either for Zeltik during their demo, so it's unclear how the repair bonus actually works. "Bow repair" is self-explanatory in that it'll repair a bow, of course, though "equipment repair" is a little more vague. Link's other, non-bow equipment in both games includes shields and breakable weapons, but there's no indication yet as to which category that repair might apply to.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p>GoldenEye 007 is one of the most iconic and beloved games ever, but it's never gotten a proper remaster. That's not for a lack of trying, though. Stephen Kick, the head of Nightdive Studios, said in an interview that the company tried to make it happen--but Nintendo apparently shut it down.</p><p>Nightdive is known for bring back old games for modern consoles, with some of the titles under its belt including Turok, Doom 64, and Quake II, among many others.</p><p>Kick told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/we-never-give-up-remaster-kings-nightdive-on-saving-gamings-past/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that it was "a real heartbreak" for the GoldenEye remaster to fail to come together. Kick said Nightdive put "a lot of effort" into pitching the game and assembling a "dream team" to make it happen. He said the MGM/Eon side of the equation was on board, but things fell apart when it came to Nintendo.</p><p>After getting MGM/Eon to agree, "Then it was: 'OK, we're ready to go.' 'Well, did you guys get the rights from Nintendo?' 'Wait a minute, we thought you had that.' And then Nintendo was like, 'Yeah, no third party's ever going to touch any Nintendo stuff, ever,'" Kick said.</p><p>Nightdive's Larry Kuperman added that the company has a history of working with Nintendo, as Nightdive was the first company to bring an N64 game to Switch with Turok. "So that got their attention right away," Kuperman said. "But it didn't really lead to a partnership or anything," he added.</p><p>Kuperman went on to say that Nintendo has a "very successful business philosophy that's worked well for them," so he understands why Nintendo didn't want to let Nightdive make a remaster.</p><p>"It's very hard for [Nintendo] to make an exception. And I don't know whether they knew that it was going to--how should I put this politically correctly--that it was going to leave something to be desired in there. What they put out was kind of minimal," he said. "And I'm trying to be fair about it, but I don't think that they could say, 'Well, we're going to make an exception.'"</p><p>In 2023, GoldenEye 007 came to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-007-controls-on-switch-are-wildly-unintuitive/1100-6510933/" data-ref-id="1100-6510933">Nintendo Switch and Xbox.</a> It's currently available for Xbox Game Pass. On Xbox, the game includes support for 4K resolution, with smoother frame rates. Years before this, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-remaster-gameplay-leaks-but-well-never-play-it/1100-6486936/" data-ref-id="1100-6486936">new version of GoldenEye 007 for Xbox 360 leaked online</a>. It was reportedly canceled due to rights and licensing issues. The situation may be even more complicated now that Amazon MGM Studios owns the rights to James Bond, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">original producing partners Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

                <p>Studio Chaf has announced that it is shutting down its debut game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790930/Velev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Velev</a>, days after it launched into Steam Early Access on April 9.</p><p>"As some of you may have already noticed, we weren't able to reach the point we needed to continue supporting and servicing Velev," the development team said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2790930/view/574879683755115731" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Despite our best efforts, we couldn't secure the investment we needed from VCs or larger partners. With limited options, we made the decision to launch in Early Access, hoping for the best."</p><p>Chalf added that the studio understood that Velev wasn't in the best state when it launched as a paid early access title on Steam. However, it was the only viable path forward in order to continue development.

href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-coming-in-2025-according-to-leaks-3179371/" rel="nofollow ">reported by Dexerto</a>, new Call of Duty leaks came from a Reddit post by someone named Bigbyy, who claimed they were part of a study group assembled by Activision to see what the average player might be excited about for the next Call of Duty game. The Redditor claimed the story is set in 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black Ops 2 campaign, bringing back the characters Woods and Mason. The campaign is reported to have "up to four player co-op" and an open world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the Call of Duty 2025 leaks provided by Bigbyy do align with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">original leaks from Insider Gaming</a>, and it also offers new details that suggest exciting news for Zombies fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The leaker claimed Zombies mode will have the "largest round-based map ever created," a remake of the Tranzit map from Black Ops 2, and feature a difficulty slider. As for the story details, the leaks suggest a focus on the original Zombies crew and "an exploration of the old timelines." Treyarch added Richtofen back into the Zombies storyline for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but it's been several years since Dempsey, Nikolai, or Takeo were featured.</p><p dir="ltr">The multiplayer maps Bigbyy said were shown to the study group included many older maps from the Black Ops series, but they were ported into a new futuristic Japanese setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The post also reported that Call of Duty 2025 will continue to feature Treyarch's omnimovement in all game modes, in addition to a new wall-running mechanic. Call of Duty's "Carry Forward" program is rumored to return, which would transfer the weapons and operators from Black Ops 6 into Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The original post from Bigbyy has since been deleted, and with this being leaked from an alleged study group, it's possible that any of this information could change prior to launch. We're probably a long way away from an official announcement from Activision, but until then, we have highlighted all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">rumors and details about Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, Call of Duty recently added the stoner duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/">Jay and Silent Bob as playable operators in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>. Season 3 just brought back the OG Verdansk map, and it's been<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-just-hit-a-2025-record-on-steam-following-verdansks-return-to-warzone/1100-6530610/"> successful in driving players back to Warzone</a>.</p>
