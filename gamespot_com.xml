                <p>While learning a language is challenging, it's never been easier to start, thanks to the abundance of learning apps and online classes. One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is <a href="https://go.linkby.com/ONMGOMZQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosetta Stone</a>. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering <strong>a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions</strong>, dropping the price to<strong> just $149 (was $400)</strong>, which could make it much easier to commit to the process.</p><p>While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side:</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts</h2><ul><li>Lifetime Plan -- $149 (<del>$400</del>) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages</li><li>12-month plan -- $126 (<del>$240</del>) (billed annually) | Includes one language</li><li>3-month plan -- $48 (<del>$60</del>) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language</li></ul><p>Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.</p><p>Rosetta Stone offers mobile and web apps, all of which grant you access to the same set of lessons, activities, and learning tools. Rosetta Stone uses an immersion learning approach where lessons primarily use the langauge you're trying to learn, rather than relying on explanations and translations in your native language, especially as you pass the early lessons. That may sound more intimidating than, say, Duolingo, but the upshot is this approach is closer to how you would learn a language if you moved to a new country, which helps your brain learn the information faster.</p><p>Along with the lesson plans, Rosetta Stone also includes access to free livestream classes and interactive activities like Seek &amp; Speak visual vocabulary scavenger hunts, a collection of stories read by native speakers, and a Phrasebook filled with common words and phrases that use Rosetta Stone's proprietary TruAccent tool to aid in your pronunciation accuracy. The vast majority of Rosetta Stone's content is also downloadable and usable offline.</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Languages</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Arabic</li><li dir="ltr">Chinese (Mandarin)</li><li dir="ltr">Dutch</li><li dir="ltr">English (American)</li><li dir="ltr">English (British)</li><li dir="ltr">Farsi (Persian)</li><li dir="ltr">French</li><li dir="ltr">German</li><li dir="ltr">Greek</li><li dir="ltr">Hebrew</li><li dir="ltr">Hindi</li><li dir="ltr">Irish</li><li dir="ltr">Italian</li><li dir="ltr">Japanese</li><li dir="ltr">Korean</li><li dir="ltr">Latin</li><li dir="ltr">Polish</li><li dir="ltr">Portuguese (Brazil)</li><li dir="ltr">Russian</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Latin America)</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Spain)</li><li dir="ltr">Swedish</li><li dir="ltr">Tagalog (Filipino)</li><li dir="ltr">Turkish</li><li dir="ltr">Vietnamese</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-all-time-best-price/1100-6529777/">PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>The month of December is a busy one for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The major highlight of the month is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-arc-raiders-cold-snap-update/2900-7344/" data-ref-id="2900-7344">Cold Snap update</a>, which introduces a slew of content to the game and balancing fixes across the board. However, launching right after the Cold Snap update is the first Expedition in Arc Raiders, which is essentially the game's version of a "wipe."</p><p>To find out more about Expeditions, including when the first one will begin and the requirements to embark on one, check out the guide below.</p><h2>How Expeditions work in Arc Raiders</h2><p>For starters, what exactly are Expeditions? If you've played a game like Rust or Escape from Tarkov before, then you can think of an Expedition like a wipe. This involves your character's progress being reset, forcing you to start over from scratch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623958" data-ratio="0.56382978723404" data-width="940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623958"></a><figcaption>Expeditions are a way for players to build their Raider back up </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623958-026da46f2492-expedition-project.jpg"></figure><p>However, unlike in other games, <strong>Expeditions in Arc Raiders are not forced upon every player</strong>. Instead, players can individually choose whether or not they want to participate in the Expedition. So, if you want to keep grinding out your current character, you don't have to opt into the Expedition and can simply play like you have been since the game launched. Players also have to be at least level 20 for Expeditions to unlock.</p><p>If you choose to enter the Expedition, your character isn't totally wiped. While you lose your skills, gear, blueprints, coins, quest progression, stash upgrades, and more, here's everything you keep after entering an Expedition:</p><ul><li>All unlocked maps</li><li>Cosmetics</li><li>Raider Decks</li><li>Raider Tokens</li><li>Cred </li><li>Entries in the Codex</li><li>Workshop Stations</li><li>Trials</li><li>Active Leaderboards</li><li>Personal Event progress</li></ul><p>For players who want to participate in the Expedition, though, it's not a simple one-click process. While you can choose to send your Raider on an Expedition, you want to ensure you have as much loot as possible in your stash, as the more you have, the more rewards you earn in the Expedition.</p><h2>All Expedition Rewards</h2><p>You receive one Skill Point for every one million coins of value you have in your stash at the time you enter the Expedition. You can earn a maximum of five Skill Points this way, meaning you only need five million coins or items of equal value in your stash. You can store all of this value away in your Caravan, which you can find in the Expeditions menu in-game. This allows you to save up coins and gear for the Expedition.</p><p>In addition to the extra Skill Points, here's a list of other rewards you earn by embarking on the Expedition:</p><ul><li>Patchwork Raider Outfit</li><li>Scrappy Janitor Cap</li><li>Expeditions Indicator Icon</li><li>12 extra stash spaces</li><li>10% repair buff (temporary)</li><li>5% XP boost (temporary)</li><li>6% more materials from Scrappy (temporary)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623959" data-ratio="0.49404761904762" data-width="1512" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623959"></a><figcaption>The rewards for the first Expedition in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4623959-expedition-project-cosmetic-rewa.jpg"></figure><p>The temporary rewards remain active until the next Expedition in Arc Raiders. To keep the buffs active, you'll have to participate in the following Expedition. Doing so also rewards you with increased buffs, meaning you get an even larger XP boost, materials, and repair times. If you don't participate, the buffs will deactivate.</p><h2>What is the release schedule for Expeditions?</h2><p>The first Expedition in Arc Raiders is going live on December 23, 2025. However, you need to register for the first Expedition between December 17-22. If you don't register in time, you won't be eligible for the Expedition.</p><p>After Dec. 23, you can expect the next Expedition to begin roughly two months later. We don't have any official dates for the second Expedition as of yet, but mid-February is likely when the next one will open registration.</p>
