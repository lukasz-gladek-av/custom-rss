                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is expected to be, by some accounts, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">most important release in the history of video games</a> as it relates to helping the video game industry rebound. But GTA 6 is not a magic bullet and cannot solve the wider issues within gaming as it relates to health and stability, according to analyst and NYU Stern professor Joost van Dreunen.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-how-does-this-impact-the-rest-of-the-industry" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">He told IGN </a>that people should not look to GTA 6 to help address the wider, more systemic issues impacting the video game business. GTA 6, of course, is expected to have a gargantuan debut, with one firm modeling sales of 40 million and revenue of $3 billion in the first year alone. Van Dreunen concurs that GTA 6 will be a massive launch, but said people are overly optimistic if they think GTA 6 is a magic bullet.</p><p>"After the high comes the hangover," he said. "I realize that many in the industry are looking forward to this undoubtedly pivotal moment. There's even a somewhat naive expectation that this one release will reverse the industry's current direction. It won't."</p><p>When GTA 6 comes out, gamers and investors alike with "enjoy their respective highs," but the painful comedown may come next.</p><p>"I expect a period of sobriety to follow. In the absence of any similar releases in the near future especially investors are likely to redeploy their capital elsewhere, thereby lowering the industry's overall valuation," he said.</p><p>The video game industry has faced cuts and setbacks in recent years, including a spate of mass layoffs, price increases, and numerous game cancellations.</p><p>People like former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">saying time and again that the AAA scene is unsustainable.</a> In 2012, Assassin's Creed III director Alex Hutchinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev/1100-6365381/" data-ref-id="1100-6365381">the pursuit of AAA games represents a "cancerous growth." </a>Because of this, Hutchinson said he expects AAA games to die out. "I think that will leave the AAA blockbusters as nothing more than the last of the dinosaurs," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in November 2026 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, following a delay from May 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Activision and developer Treyarch have an official excuse for people who want to blow off work to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-the-replacer-is-becoming-a-playable-operator-in-black-ops-6/1100-6527638/">The Replacer</a>, a fictional character portrayed by Peter Stormare, has written a sick note for players to give to their bosses, while jokingly adding that he will step in and boost productivity.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1989324006709707185" rel="nofollow ">official Call of Duty account on X</a> provided the sick-note template as Black Ops 7 launches today on PC and consoles. However, students are apparently out of luck, as the letter only addresses employers and not principals nor teachers. It also feels as if a parody on asking AI, like ChatGPT, to craft an excuse is missing here.</p><p dir="ltr">The sick note for a popular game release is nothing new. In fact, almost a decade ago, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skip-work-or-school-to-play-fallout-4-with-this-to/1100-6432097/">a fake doctor's memo created for Fallout 4</a>. In 2019, developer Respawn posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-sick-note-for-star-wars-fallen-order-play/1100-6471480/">a silly droid note for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order players</a>. Meanwhile, last year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-replacer-has-come-to-replace-your-favorite-memes/1100-6527319/">Replacer came to replace your favorite memes</a>, with Stormare even doing<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condescending_Wonka" rel="nofollow "> the Condescending Wonka meme</a>. Stormare first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaIhm01aIY4">brought the character to life for Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 in 2013</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you do skip work or school today, be forewarned that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-pause-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-so-you-better-hold-it-in/1100-6536212/"> Black Ops 7 doesn't let you pause the campaign</a>. That means if someone calls to check up on you, they might hear explosions and gunfire in the background. In addition, Treyarch has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/"> tweaked aim assist with Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign review</a>.</p>

                <p>It's a been a long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, but the return of bounty hunter Samus Aran is just a few weeks away. Now, Nintendo has dropped an extended trailer for Metroid Prime 4 that sets up the story, shows off her new powers, and reveals that she does have allies on the planet Viewros. What she doesn't have is a way to get off the hostile world that's trying to kill her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBR0H1F5hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mBR0H1F5hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the opening minutes of the trailer, Samus answers a distress call from a Galactic Federation research center that comes under attack by her rival, Sylux. During the battle, Samus is somehow transported to an unknown and hostile world called Viewros. And some of the Galactic Federation troops survived to make the trip as well. But without a ship, this may be a one-way journey for Samus and her allies.</p><p>Samus' standard abilities are back in this game, and she picks up a few new skills including psychic powers that can direct her shots with precision or operate the long-abandoned machinery on Viewros. GameSpot recently had a chance to try out those psychic powers during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/" data-ref-id="1100-6536193">a hands-on experience with Metroid Prime 4</a>. </p><p>There are several different biomes on the planet, abandoned factories, and an open-world desert that Samus can travel across on her motorcycle, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">the Vi-0-La</a>. Samus can even summon the Vi-0-La while exploring the various factories, and the game shifts from first-person to third-person in these scenes.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4 will be available on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4, but only the latter has mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 that can give Samus even greater control of her aim. The video demonstrates how players can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">swap from standard to mouse controls</a> at will.</p>

                <p>After getting leaked earlier this week, Epic Games has revealed that Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator will join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on November 14 as an purchasable skin.</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1989332670351102047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a seven-second teaser video</a> of the "Don't Tap the Glass" rapper's skin. In the clip, we get a look at two outfits for Tyler, the Creator: his green "Chromakopia" getup and an ensemble that closely resembles his "Wolf" or "Cherry Bomb" days.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/tyler-the-creator-fortnite-skin-leaked-all-cosmetics-outfits-prices-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 12 Vice story</a>, prolific dataminer NotPaloLeaks unveiled this Tyler, the Creator collaboration in an X post on November 11. As Vice speculates, his skins could cost 1,500 V-Bucks, and his arrival may come with cosmetics like weapon wraps, pickaxes, backpacks, jam tracks, and emotes. The official Fortnite X account hasn't confirmed this yet, but Tyler, the Creator hits the in-game shop on November 14, so it won't be much longer until everything is made clearer.</p><p>Regardless of what comes with Tyler, the Creator's arrival, the Fortnite community is losing its mind. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1owxaqw/the_wait_is_over_tylerthecreator_is_landing_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent post in r/FortniteBR about the reveal</a>, the comments are filled with excitement. "Pretty cool. Was hoping for Chromakopia," one Redditor said. "God yes," another user chimed.</p><p>The sentiment is about the same on X. In the replies to the teaser video, users expressed their enthusiasm for the skin. "Finally," <a href="https://x.com/G_BoysAccount/status/1989336309735841871" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one poster said with a Family Guy GIF</a>. "It's enough to make a grown man cry," <a href="https://x.com/AbrahamDia11852/status/1989333187290435877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied another</a>.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is pleased with the collab. Some in that r/FortniteBR post dismissed the skin. Meanwhile, users in the replies to Fortnite's X post were taken aback by his appearance, with one poster calling the skin "<a href="https://x.com/SrSonicCraft1/status/1989333226704249240" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tyron the Architect</a>" because of the face he makes when diving from the Battle Bus in the teaser video.</p><p>Tyler, the Creator joins Fortnite just as Springlefield continues taking over the battle royale shooter. The Simpsons have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">running all over Fortnite Island</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/son-of-a-diddly-ned-flanders-has-eliminated-33000-unneighborly-fortnite-players/1100-6536031/" data-ref-id="1100-6536031">Ned Flanders in particular piling up the bodies</a>. However, Fox's cartoon won't stick around for much longer; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">Season 7 is slated to start on November 29</a>, with Fortnite Island possibly taking on a distinctive LA flair and new collabs--from Kill Bill to SpongeBob SquarePants--hinted at joining the game.</p>
