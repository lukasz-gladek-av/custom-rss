                <p>You'll take on a lot of quests that send you to the Dam Battlegrounds in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, including one from Tian Wen who wants you to search for Major Aiva's Mementos in some apartment buildings. This is a straightforward quest on paper, but because there are multiple buildings to explore and the ever-looming threat of ARC and other raiders, it's best to know right where to find these mementos so you can get out quickly.</p><p>Since you need to extract with Major Aiva's Mementos, it's a good idea to equip an augment that lets you store an item in a safe pocket. Once you pick up the mementos, you can toss it in that safe pocket and take it home with you even if you end up dead before you can extract.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's find Major Aiva's Mementos and wrap up The Major's Footlocker quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva’s Mementos for The Major's Footlocker quest</h2><p>Major Aiva's Mementos can be found in an apartment building located at the Ruby Residence POI. This area is located in the northwestern section of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138" data-ratio="0.58616404308202" data-width="2414" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138"></a><figcaption>Ruby Residence</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the apartment complex, you'll want to head into the leftmost building. The item you're looking for is on the top floor (not the roof). Head up two flights of stairs, then wrap around and follow the rooms until you reach a dead end with a window and a box on a desk in the corner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg"></figure><p>This box contains Major Aiva's Mementos. You'll need to interact with it, then pick up the item and store it in your inventory.</p><p>As stated above, you're required to extract with this item. Hopefully, you have a safe pocket slot! Either way, your closest options are likely to be the Central Swamp Lift to the south or the North Complex Elevator to the east. The safer choice is probably the latter, as the former tends to stay pretty busy with other players perusing the swamp for mushrooms and other quests. Whichever you choose, play things safe and get out alive, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly trickling in, including a limited-time offer on NordVPN. The VPN company is offering its several of its <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscription plans for up to 77% off</a>, with an additional 3 months tacked on for even better value</strong>. Using a VPN is a good way to buff up your privacy capabilities and maintain access to region-locked content while traveling. If you've been on the fence, NordVPN's discounted prices make now a great time to consider a subscription.</p><p>NordVPN is offering all 24-month and 12-month versions of its Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime subscription tiers at significant discounts, with an additional three months included. That's 15 total months of VPN service for far less than you'd normally pay.</p><p>The 24-month Prime plan offers the best value. It includes full access to the VPN, plus additional incentives such as 1TB of cloud storage, advanced identity protection, and the NordProtect service, which has a robust suite of insurance, Dark Web monitoring, and credit freeze assistance options. The 24-month Prime plan normally costs $836.73, but with the discount, new subscribers can sign up for just $186. That's a whopping $650 savings, and it includes the bonus three months, for a total of 27 months.</p><p>If you're looking for something in the short term, the 12-month plans are also discounted, and each one includes the three extra months. For example, the 12-month Prime subscription includes everything in the 24-month plan, but instead costs $127.35 (normally $464.85/year), and you're getting 15 months at that price thanks to the bonus three months.</p><p>We've included a quick breakdown of NordVPN's discounted plans below, and you can browse the full details of the deal at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NordVPN's website</a>. NordVPN lists the monthly cost of its plans, but the 2-Year plans are actually billed every 24 months, and the 1-Year plans are billed annually, so you'll pay the full price for the subscription period upfront when you sign up. NordVPN also offers monthly plans, but these are not eligible for the Black Friday deal. It's also important to note that your subscription will revert to the standard price after the promotional period ends, unless you cancel or update your plan before the end of the promotional period.</p><h2>NordVPN Black Friday Deals</h2><h4>2-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $80.73 (<del>$313</del>)</li><li>Plus 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $105 (<del>$404.73</del>)</li><li>Complete 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $132 (<del>$493.83</del>)</li><li>Prime 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $186 (<del>$836.73</del>)</li></ul><h4>1-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months --$68.85 (<del>$173.85</del>)</li><li>Plus 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $82.35 (<del>$224.85</del>)</li><li>Complete 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $97.35 (<del>$274.35</del>)</li><li>Prime 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $127.35 (<del>$464.85</del>)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>In 2010, Visceral Games and Electronic Arts unleashed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dantes-inferno/" data-ref-id="5000-40808">Dante's Inferno</a>, an action-adventure game that was their answer to God of War. The story was very loosely inspired by Dante Alighieri's classic text, The Divine Comedy, as Dante sought to retrieve the soul of his wife, Beatrice, from Hell while facing Lucifer and the forces of evil. Now, 15 years after the game's release, new details have emerged about the canceled sequel, Dante's Inferno 2: Purgatorio.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> has an extensive report about Purgatorio, which includes a comprehensive breakdown of the story. The follow-up was envisioned as the inverse of the first game, as Dante was meant to scale Mount Purgatory to reunite with Beatrice and reach the Garden of Eden on top. However, each layer of the mountain represented one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and Dante had to both purge himself of those sins and defeat the embodiment of each one.</p><p>Dante also would have found himself in the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell, which he inadvertently set off by allowing Lucifer to escape Hell and invade Purgatory. St. Lucia--Dante's guardian angel from the first game's DLC--and the poet Virgil would have returned to guide Dante on his journey. To reach his goal, Dante would have to defeat some lethal archangels who considered him to be their enemy.</p><p>Along the way, Dante would have reunited and reconciled with Beatrice and banished her evil side from her. Or at least that's what he thought he did. In the game's closing moments, Dante and Beatrice made it all the way to Heaven, just for the former to discover that Lucifer had tricked him again. Through Beatrice, Lucifer murders Dante and casts him all the way back down to Hell. The only hope that ending offered is the spirit of St. Lucia, who assures Dante that even his death was part of God's plan.</p><p>The proposed third game, Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso, would have brought the war between Heaven and Hell to Earth and introduced Dante and Beatrice's daughter, who would be among the mortal warriors who fight alongside angels to reclaim Heaven from Lucifer and save Beatrice. God's plan would have been revealed as a plot to tear down the unforgiving ritual of sending souls to Heaven or Hell and replace it with something more compassionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, these ideas will likely never see the light of day as a game. But it's an intriguing look at what could have been.</p>

The original Switch will continue to be sold, Nintendo confirmed, but the company will focus on the Switch 2 going ahead.</p><p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware," Nintendo said.</p><p>In total, Nintendo has sold 154.01 million Switch consoles worldwide through September 30, and that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">just 10,000 units short of passing the DS</a> to become Nintendo's best-selling platform of all time.</p><p>The Switch is still millions of units short of catching up to the PS2, which is the best-selling console of all time with an estimated 160 million units sold. At least one expert believes the Switch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">will not catch the PS2.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and a variety of accessories</a> due in part to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo is predicting to sell fewer Switch consoles than before. For the current fiscal year, Nintendo is now expecting to sell 4 million units, down from a previous prediction of 4.5 million. However, Nintendo is revising Switch game sales up from 105 million to 125 million.</p><p>For the Switch 2, meanwhile, Nintendo is raising projections from 15 million to 19 million for the current fiscal year. The Switch 2 has sold more than 10 million units worldwide, making it the fastest-selling Nintendo platform ever over its first four months.</p>

This includes the full list of multiplayer maps, game modes, and operators available in Black Ops 7 before the launch of Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">For maps, Black Ops 7 launches with 18 multiplayer maps. This list consists of 16 core 6v6 maps, while the additional two are large-scale 20v20 maps designed for Black Ops 7's new Skirmish mode. Most of the maps are brand new, but the game does include a few popular remasters from Black Ops 2. The full list of launch maps can be seen below.</p>

This is a variant of Treyarch's iconic Nuketown map, which is reimagined with the aesthetics of a near-future design. Nuketown 2025 is not available at launch, but it will arrive before the start of Black Ops 7's first season of content.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 12 game modes confirmed for launch, and these are featured for the game's standard core and hardcore playlists. Many of the modes are Call of Duty staples, such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search and Destroy, and Hardpoint. However, Black Ops 7 does introduce the 20v20 objective-based Skirmish mode and the new Overload mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Overload is a 6v6 respawn mode that tasks teams with fighting to gain possession of an overload device. Overload begins with players rushing to grab the overload device. Once they have it, the team possessing it must protect the carrier as they attempt to bring it to a designated zone. Overload is a back-and-forth game of attack and defend, and this is also the new competitive game mode for the Call of Duty League.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All MP game modes at launch:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Overload</li><li dir="ltr">Team Deathmatch</li><li dir="ltr">Domination</li><li dir="ltr">Search and Destroy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Confirmed</li><li dir="ltr">Free-for-All</li><li dir="ltr">Hardpoint</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Order</li><li dir="ltr">Control</li><li dir="ltr">Face Off Moshpit</li><li dir="ltr">Skirmish (20v20)</li><li dir="ltr">Gunfight (2v2)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has 24 playable operators, but not all of them are available right away.
