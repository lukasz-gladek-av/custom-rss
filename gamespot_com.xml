                <p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced that it's making a game for Sony Interactive Entertainment based on an IP that Sony owns, though it remains to be seen what the game is.</p><p>In a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, People Can Fly said the new game is in the works under the codename Project Delta. As part of the agreement between People Can Fly and Sony, <span>there will be a milestone process. Details weren't provided, but this is a common practice where development progress is reviewed at certain intervals.</span></p><p>People Can Fly did not divulge the specific scope and terms of its milestone agreement with Sony but said it does not differ much from standard work-for-hire projects of this nature. The Polish studio has a lot of experience in this department, as it has worked with big game companies on projects before, including Gears of War: Judgment with Microsoft, Fortnite: Saves the World with Epic, and Outriders with Square Enix. People Can Fly is also working with PUBG company Krafton on a new game codenamed <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">collaborating with The Coalition on Gears of War: E-Day. </a></p><p>The official word is that People Can Fly's game with Sony is "based on the intellectual property rights owned by" Sony, but there is no word on what it is. It sounds like it could be an existing Sony franchise, but that is never stated outright in the document. Another document from People Can Fly describes the agreement as<a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-3-2025-commencement-of-negotiations-with-sony-disclosure-of-delayed-inside-information-final.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> covering work to create a prototype</a>.</p><p>Founded in 2002, People Can Fly released the first-person shooter Painkiller in 2004 as its first game. Epic Games took a majority ownership of the company in 2007 following the cancellation of People Can Fly's game Come Midnight with now-defunct publisher THQ. In 2012, Epic bought People Can Fly and re-named it Epic Games Poland, but in 2015, People Can Fly became independent again.</p>

                <p>Bethesda's 2023 RPG Starfield is not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">ruled out for PS5</a>, but it also hasn't been announced for Sony's system like some of Bethesda's other games have, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Now, a listing on Bethesda's modding website might suggest a PS5 edition of the game is coming. </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1jb6ldu/they_have_added_the_playstation_logo_to_a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user Dollar99Man</a> reshared a finding from YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@510DeshawnPlays/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">510deshawn</a> who discovered that the Bethesda Creation Kit website for Starfield was updated with the PlayStation logo, sitting alongside the logos for PC and Xbox. However, the Starfield Creation Kit hub <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not allow players to choose "PlayStation" as a platform in the filter</a>, despite the logo appearing on one of the mod's pages.</p><p>It's possible to<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=PS&amp;sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> tweak the URL</a> to force the filter to show mods listed for PlayStation. For a period of time today, March 14, this displayed one result for the mod listed for PlayStation. However, it has since been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675" data-ratio="0.52787663107948" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675"></a><figcaption>A PlayStation listing sits alongside Xbox and PC platforms for a Starfield mod.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png"></figure><p>It's possible this whole thing was an error and that it doesn't signal any kind of forthcoming announcement from Bethesda.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm that Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console. He said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">"No,"</a> going on to state that he sees no reason to ever "put a ring fence around any game" and say it could never come to a platform where it could find an audience and bring in money for Microsoft. </p><p>Starfield coming to PS5 would fit within Xbox's strategy of bringing more games to PlayStation. However, the wait for Starfield to come to PS5 has been lengthier compared to some of the other Xbox games that eventually came to PS5.</p><p>Starfield launched in September 2023 and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-passes-15-million-players-as-game-adds-new-vehicle-and-quest/1100-6527873/#:~:text=Starfield%20has%20crossed%20a%20new,quest%2C%20fixes%2C%20and%20more." data-ref-id="1100-6527873">reached more than 15 million players.</a> Bethesda recently acknowledged that fans are eager for updates, adding that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"hard at work" on new content</a>, but it's too soon to reveal anything. "We have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right," Bethesda said.</p>

                <p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has been out for almost a decade, and it's been endlessly modded in the intervening 10 years. However, the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced</a> upgrade isn't compatible with mods from the prior version. But now, it looks like Rockstar is opening the door for those mods to make the leap into the Enhanced era, courtesy of the team behind its FiveM and RedM creator communities.</p><p>Cfx.re, which was brought into Rockstar in 2023, <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has revealed</a> that it is developing a new official mod tool that will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade."</p><p>According to the announcement, Cfx.re hasn't set a release date for the mod tool yet. But it notes that that "we're currently focused on completing the final few tasks required to release the tool." The full announcement of the tool, with "comprehensive documentation," will be shared on the day it goes live.</p><p>While GTA 5 Enhanced gave the PC version upgraded visuals, it's also been bombarded with bad reviews on Steam. The original version of GTA 5 has also been delisted on Steam, which means that the enhanced version is the only one available to new players.</p><p>For now, GTA 5 Enhanced will be the only modern Grand Theft Auto game on PC, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S when it's released later this year.
