                <p dir="ltr">A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">Itch</a>, thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit.</p><p dir="ltr">Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYewjNYxV-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JYewjNYxV-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In the week preceding its launch, Santa Ragione published an </span><a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ</a><span> explaining that Horses had already been banned on Steam, as well as outlining why the storefront might have made this decision. Why? According to Santa Ragione, the chief reason for Valve's response seems to stem from a review build of Horses back in 2023 and a back-and-forth between the game's publisher and Valve that resulted in Horses' ban before the game could even be finished or meaningfully altered. More specifically, the development team believed that a scene from the in-progress build, which featured a child riding on the shoulders of a naked woman, was Valve's biggest cause of concern. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But as anyone who has actually played Horses can attest, the scene has been altered for the better, and now features a grown woman in the place of the little girl. The scene becomes stronger with this change largely due to the dialogue the player has with the woman, who calmly acknowledges the human-shaped horse in the room, making herself and her father knowingly complicit in the awful violence being enacted on the farm. The alteration also happens to clear up any suspicion that Horses ever featured a pornographic scene--even if the interaction in question was never sexual--with a child.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Despite the ban, Santa Ragione still forged ahead and released the controversial title on December 2 across other digital storefronts, including the Epic Games Store, Itch, and GOG. In an unfortunate eleventh-hour reversal, EGS (through which a handful of reviewers had actually redeemed and played through Horses) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/">removed the game from its storefront</a>. A few days later, Humble briefly took down Horses from its store as well, before reinstating the game after reviewing it more closely.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice to say, the impact of these bans has irreparably harmed Horses and the publisher behind it, even if the controversy and noise around the game has drawn support and attention it might not have otherwise received.</p><p dir="ltr">Horses' ban is just the latest in a concerning trend though. In the months since Valve first purged its store of a number of concerning NSFW games and simulations--ones that <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">promoted</a> "rape, incest, sexual torture, and child abuse" and that the organization Collective Shout <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">reportedly</a> applied pressure to Steam's payment processors in order to remove--it appears to also be increasingly clamping down on many current <em>and</em> future adult games that might broach similar themes. To that end, games which feature "mature themes," i.e. sexually explicit content, are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-is-no-longer-allowing-adult-games-in-early-access/1100-6534685/">no longer permitted in Steam's early access program</a>, making it that much harder for independent developers who regularly explore these topics to have viable pathways to success (let alone visibility) in the medium. Despite the fact that the intent of this movement appeared to be ridding these stores of harmful bad actors, the consequences of it have rippled outwards in a way that threatens many developers, though it certainly isn't impacting everyone equally.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624026" data-ratio="0.57354925775978" data-width="741" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624026"></a><figcaption>Horses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4624026-2358886564-7c6ec.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Paired with the AA and AAA gaming space's reluctance to explore and address similar themes (with a few notable exceptions), the chilling effect of this wave of bans threatens to stunt the growth of the games industry, its creative forces, and the audience that engages with games. We are currently watching a digital storefront pick and choose who and what passes a purity test whose terms and requirements are largely nebulous, and policing what art gets to entertain and provoke us. If Horses' ban, which on Steam alone threatens to preclude it from "</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam" rel="nofollow ">more than 75 percent of the PC gaming market</a><span>," as well as the numerous developments around Steam's policies, are any indication, there is tremendous cause for concern about the future of artistry in games.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, I'm concerned about what these enforcements have to say about what is permissible in these stores, and more importantly, <em>who</em> is allowed to do it. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/" rel="nofollow ">Aftermath</a>'s Chris Person points out, there are games, even whole franchises, that feature similar themes and have gotten away with little to no scrutiny over their depictions. He writes: "If the invalidating content was slavery, then Final Fantasy XVI, Fallout: New Vegas, and Dragon Age: Origins would never be allowed to be sold. If torture is unallowed, then (Grand Theft Auto) V violates Epic's terms of service with 'By The Book,' a mission where Trevor tortures a guy by pulling his teeth out with pliers and electrocuting his nipples on behalf of the government. Americans understand and respect graphic violence, torture, and abuse as art, and on that front Horses is far less graphic than any 30 seconds in a recent Mortal Kombat game."</p><p dir="ltr">The actual events of Horses are gnarly, and its content warnings should not be taken lightly, but it is not only tamer than the far cruder works from which it takes inspiration--chiefly the Italian film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom" rel="nofollow ">Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</a>--but shows far more restraint in its depictions of violence than most M-rated games. The content Horses features, and the themes it uses these subjects to probe, are not exactly the stuff of children's books and fairy tales, so why is it and its potential audience being handled with kid gloves?</p><p dir="ltr">The answer, as usual, seems to come down to some degree of clout and/or reputation. If you are too large to fail or deny--like a Grand Theft Auto game bound to sell millions of copies for the decade following its release--and replicate the same tepid and self-serving explorations of these adult subjects, then you can probably get away with being a game for adults by adults. In other words, games can be about sex so long as the player can romance and sleep with their in-game crush. Games can be about violence if the player is the one capable of committing outstandingly gratuitous and self-aggrandizing acts of violence or if they can reap the benefits of it. But you can only really be about either if you're sure to be a big seller, and you don't actually need to look much further than the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/">2025 Game Awards</a> for proof of this trend, either.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian Studios, the now beloved developer behind 2023's landmark game Baldur's Gate 3, recently unveiled its upcoming game, Divinity, in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/">boundary-pushing trailer</a> that reveled in extremely photorealistic violence, gore, and depictions of brazen sexuality. In it, a man is strung up to be sacrificed in a pyre while cultists watch, self-flagellate, and engage in public orgies. As he catches fire, we watch his skin melt off and his gaunt figure be torn to shreds. A child, who at one point seems concerned about the violence and is shown tugging on her mother's dress, is then revealed to be yet another zealous onlooker of all the violence and seemingly crass displays of sex that we've all just witnessed. And while the whole thing has caused some stir and raised some eyebrows, Larian is far less likely to be condemned and have their game withheld from stores than Santa Ragione.</p><p dir="ltr">The only clear distinguishing factor between these games and Horses seems to be that some of the above companies are too affluent (and their games are considered too profitable) for any of these stores and their creators to police. Santa Ragione and the likely hundreds of independent developers suffering at the whims of Steam's policy changes, aren't. Threatening one of the former would impact these stores' bottom lines. The latter likely won't.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems the corporations in control of the games industry seem intent on infantilizing gaming audiences, and bottle-feeding them the "right" kind of mature games. Anything that falls outside those thinly defined parameters, set by the most influential and powerful figures in gaming, is now morally deviant. But in a medium increasingly dominated by the likes of Fortnite, PlayStation's growing crop of prestige bids, AI slop, and games that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-ceo-responds-to-child-predator-concerns-poorly/1100-6536445/"><em>actually</em> harmful to kids, like Roblox</a>, I desperately want games to <em>also</em> carve out a niche for avant-garde and otherwise deviant experiences. Games that push boundaries, raise questions, and give voice to uncomfortable notions and themes. Games that live up to the foundational tenets of art, even if I don't like or play them. Anything less is unbecoming of a field that constantly fights for a seat at the table of other artistic mediums, all of which have borne fruit far more boundary-pushing than anything found in Horses.</p><p>There is a rot at the core of this issue that threatens to swallow the artistry of the medium whole. A rot that wants to paper over the uncomfortable and authentic tendencies of art that are often antithetical to the profit-driven motives of corporations. For the sake of this maturing field, a field which so desperately wants to be seen and treated as if it's grown, I hope that we can stymie its efforts. For Horses, for every NSFW and adult game wrongfully censored before it, and for any future deviants to come.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Shooters are having a moment in 2025, with Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">Arc Raiders topping the charts</a> and attracting large player counts as the year comes to an end. The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 - "Something to Fight For" Launch Announcement Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come. From microtransaction controversies to studio CEO Ian Proulx donning the most egregious headwear possible in a livestreamed industry event, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/">developer layoffs</a> and an extremely unusual<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/"> "unlaunching" of the game</a>, 2025 was nothing but tumultuous for the Splitgate team.</p><p dir="ltr">But what is easy to forget amid the public drama is how Splitgate 2 played--and it actually played very well. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 delivered crunchy gunplay</a>, retaining the simple-to-play, hard-to-master feel of its sleeper-hit predecessor. Whizzing around the map through portals was still a thrilling sensation, and the streamlined controls map portal creation to just one button (instead of two, like the previous Splitgate), made traversal feel faster and snappier.</p><p dir="ltr">Placing and traveling through portals remained an excellent and approachable movement tool. While other first-person shooters today have more advanced and esoteric movement techniques like slide-canceling and other exploits, portals are an easy concept to grasp--one that even the most casual player could use for creative strategies and plays.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620333"></a><figcaption>Splitgate 2 successfully retained the fast and frenetic pace of its predecessor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620333-yo40sq5wr82f1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The early days of Splitgate 2 were also a reminder of the joy of "discovering" a game, watching new players try to wrap their heads around the portal traversal, and either stumbling or instantly excelling in matches. In those early days, it was much easier to create portals in strategic zones and completely mow down clueless opponents through them--which was fun in its own way. But as time passed, the budding player-base collectively figured out the inner workings of Splitgate.</p><p dir="ltr">The new game also addressed one of my biggest gripes with the prior one: the lack of any personality or visual identity. Splitgate 1 came across as a hodgepodge of assets and art styles, with generic soldiers that looked like "Master Chief at home" and anthropomorphic characters that make Peely from Fortnite look grounded in comparison.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2, on the other hand, presented a bolder and more refined art style, defined by bright, pastel colors. With sleeker character designs and environments, Splitgate 2 not only looked a lot better and more coherent, but the world of Splitgate became more tangible. Instead of vaguely resembling a Halo rip-off, Splitgate 2 made strides to build its own look and universe.</p><p dir="ltr">More controversial in Splitgate 2 was the addition of Factions, which were essentially archetypes or classes, each with its own unique kit of abilities. Larger franchises like Call of Duty and Halo have toyed with the concept, adding elements of Overwatch-style hero shooters in the mix, usually resulting in fan backlash.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620336"></a><figcaption>The addition of a battle royale mode felt contradictory to Splitgate 2's mission.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620336-splitgate2_launch_blog_storm_01_1080p0_f12e7ca6d8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">From my experience, Factions and abilities are mostly harmless, rarely changing the calculus of a match, though I did desire game modes that lacked these additions and put a greater focus on the core portal FPS arena action. At the very least, the presence of Factions showed that 1047 Games was tempted by modern shooter ideas, even ones that were at odds with Splitgate's stated mission of bringing back a pure arena experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The strength of Splitgate 2 as a game was ultimately upended by the behind-the-scenes strife and widely reported missteps by the studio's management. Enjoying Splitgate 2 became a frustrating affair, knowing how much better the game could be if its makers stopped fumbling the ball.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because, on paper, Splitgate is an easy property to root for: It's built by an independent studio out of love for classic, beloved games, and it's an underdog swimming in a sea of live-service games. On the surface, 1047 Games appears to be a very collaborative studio, engaging directly with the community and seemingly taking feedback to heart. But the questionable decisions added up, with Splitgate 2 flying too close to the games-as-a-service sun with ridiculous in-game shop prices and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-battle-royale-mode-out-now-alongside-splitgate-2-official-release/1100-6532195/">shoehorned battle royale mode</a>. Proulx's "Hatgate" at Summer Game Fest also suggested that this studio, or at least the top brass, simply wasn't ready for the spotlight it craved on its crusade to revive the arena-shooter genre.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620338"></a><figcaption>The rebooted Splitgate: Arena Reloaded represents a rare second chance for a struggling studio.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4620338-abyssactionwithportal1p.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the past few years, 1047 Games experienced a greater volume of triumph and turmoil faster than most studios ever will. Splitgate 1, years after a lukewarm launch, blew up during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-to-have-historic-launch-with-many-new-features-planned-thanks-to-100-million-investment/1100-6496241/">massive amounts of funding</a>. Then, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-developer-announces-end-to-feature-development-shifts-focus-to-new-game/1100-6507095/">pivoted to making a sequel instead of building on the original game</a>. And after a botched launch of the sequel, the studio pulled the game back into a beta state, which, quite honestly, I didn't know was something game developers would even dare to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after all of this, 1047 Games is still standing, ready to relaunch Splitgate 2 into a new, even more streamlined experience<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-arena-reloaded-will-relaunch-the-halo-meets-portal-shooter-after-a-rough-year/1100-6536677/"> called Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</a>. Somehow, the studio survived ordeals that would kill most organizations, and it has a second chance that many studios would never receive.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who played Splitgate 2, or at least found some investment in the game, has likely made up their mind on whether or not 1047 Games deserves this second chance. But with how fun and pure its Halo-meets-Portal action is, the gameplay concept itself is absolutely deserving.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>"It's been the blueprint, especially the community participation with early access, which is what interests us. It was [with] Divinity: Original Sin 1, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3--they [the community members] were a large part of how we developed the games," he said.</p><p>Vincke said these games "improved massively" due in part to them releasing in early access.</p><p>"Players being invested in it increases the pressure and their participation in it, so you get something really cool out of that process--even if it's painful for the developer," he said. So, we have to swallow our pride and say, 'Ok, you guys are right, we're wrong, we accept it, you've made your point.'"</p><p>Putting a game into early access "causes extra development effort, but it leads to a better game," Vincke said, adding that this is the whole point.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 has been Larian's biggest success to date, selling more than 20 million copies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Bloomberg.</a> That game's first act launched into early access in August 2020, and Larian added more content over the ensuing months and years leading up to the public release for everyone in August 2023.</p><p>As for the new Divinity game, it was announced at The Game Awards with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">super-gross trailer.</a> The game will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts," according to Vincke.</a> The developer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI for Divinity</a> to help developers have more time and freedom to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">work on creative concepts instead of boring work that "nobody wants to do."</a> At least one former Larian developer spoke out against Larian's use of generative AI, saying the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">should show their employees "some respect."</a></p>

                <p>Terminator: Survivors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-survivors-delayed-to-2025/1100-6525734/" data-ref-id="1100-6525734">once planned for release in 2024</a>, has been delayed yet again and is now set to launch sometime after 2025.</p><p>The game is in development at Nacon Studio Milan. Creative director Marco Ponte said the decision to delay the game was made "after months of internal testing," along with discussions from fans. As a result of these discussions, the developer also decided to cut multiplayer co-op from the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Terminator Survivors - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>

<p>"We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day," Ponte said.</p><p>Additionally, the developer canceled plans to launch the game as an early-access title. "We want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience," Ponte said.</p><p>As for a new release date for Survivors, Ponte didn't have one to give, but the game will not be out in 2025. That was what many people guessed already, though, given the year is nearly through.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nacon will conduct closed playtests in the time ahead--you can <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.nacongaming.com%2Fplaytests">sign up here</a> for a chance to get into a future test.</p><p>"We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we've been working on. For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the Terminator legacy," Ponte said.</p><p>Terminator: Survivors was not the only Terminator game to be delayed this year, as Bitmap Bureau and Reef Entertainment delayed Terminator 2D: No Fate, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-has-been-delayed-yet-again/1100-6535978/" data-ref-id="1100-6535978">finally came out on December 12.</a></p>
