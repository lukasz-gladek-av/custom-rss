                <p>XP has been a regular topic of conversation among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players during Chapter 6 Season 4, as Epic Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-xp-gains-are-reportedly-slower-in-chapter-6-season-4/1100-6533768/" data-ref-id="1100-6533768">apparently slashed how quickly most folks will level up</a> just by playing normally. Since this season is a month longer than last season was, it's not a particularly surprising change. Fortunately, Fortnite is easing the burden a bit by offering double XP all weekend. The boost will last until Monday, September 8 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p><p>Double XP weekends aren't a very common thing in Fortnite. Typically, when Epic wants to help players gain XP faster, it adds limited-time event quests with simple objectives that are easy to complete in Battle Royale, Reload, or whatever other mode the company wants to promote. Fortnite's most recent double XP weekend event like this one happened back in March.</p><p>The double XP is only one of the things Epic changed for this weekend. Blitz Royale is having a Golden Llamageddon event, where the map will be filled with special gold llama pinatas full of top-tier loot. And in Battle Royale, they've unvaulted several old weapons, including the grapple glove, the Boom Bow, the original pump shotgun, and the beloved Holo Twister rifle that was everybody's favorite gun during the first two seasons of Chapter 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859" data-ratio="0.51230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859"></a><figcaption>The Holo Twister assault rifle is back in Battle Royale this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg"></figure><p>And over in Fortnite OG, the path is diverging from how it went in Chapter 1 Season 5 the first time, with the giant purple cube Kevin from back in the day being replaced by the giant red cube Revin.</p><p>All these shenanigans are likely to come to an end at the same time double XP does on Monday, so there's only a limited amount of time to take part before things go back to normal.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a>'s November release, Treyarch dropped a <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1964011130155913323" rel="nofollow ">brief video</a> to answer some questions about the game's multiplayer. The developer discussed some of the movement changes coming to Call of Duty in Black Ops 7 as well as teased more remastered maps from 2012's Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of popular Call of Duty maps have been remastered over the years, and Black Ops 7 is already confirmed to have three at launch. Raid, Hijacked, and Express return this year, but they've all been remastered in previous Black Ops games, leaving fans eager for different maps to appear.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if players can get some Black Ops 2 remasters that have never been seen before, Treyarch design director Matt Scronce simply answered, "Yes, you can."</p><p dir="ltr">Maps like Yemen and Plaza have been highly requested over the years, so hopefully these locations will finally return to Call of Duty as remastered maps in Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce also discussed the movement for Black Ops 7 multiplayer. The developer re-confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 doesn't feature jet packs or wall-running mechanics. Instead, the game includes redefined omnimovement with a wall-jump ability, which can be chained together for up to three jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">"On that second and third jump, you're going to lose a little bit of momentum," Scronce explained. "We honestly want to make sure people aren't ping ponging around the maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision recently revealed that the previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7 has been cancelled</a>, mostly. Weapons, operator skins, and other cosmetics from Black Ops 6 will no longer transfer to Black Ops 7. Only double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to try out the game's multiplayer next month, as detailed in our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">how to get access to the Black Ops 7 beta</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. You can find highlights of all major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">Black Ops 7 announcements</a> here, which includes details on an endgame for the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic design for multiplayer.</p>

All the basics are recreated, of course, like the general layout of the office and the desks. The downstairs warehouse is there, too.</p><p>But this user-created space really shines with the finer points, like two chairs on the roof to signify where Jim and Pam watched fireworks together, along with the snowman-like sculptures in the parking lot where Jim was terrorized by Dwight.</p><p>It also includes a radar speed sign outside and multiple people standing around it, mirroring that time Michael ran a humanly impossible 31 mph. These smaller details aren't in the flyover video embedded below, but can be found in the creation itself and shared by the creator in comments posted on Reddit.</p><p>This is just the latest example of the immense creativity of No Man's Sky players, and you don't have to look hard to find more. Game creator Sean Murray highlighted some of his favorite No Man's Sky custom ship builds this week, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-players-are-going-wild-with-the-new-ship-builder/1100-6534464/" data-ref-id="1100-6534464">a ship modeled after Thomas the Tank engine and even himself.</a></p><p>As for The Office, the show's spin-off series The Paper is out now on Peacock. The show follows the same in-universe documentary crew that made The Office, but this time they're making a documentary about a struggling newspaper and the efforts to revitalize it. The show stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore, all episodes are out now, and a second season has already been ordered.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p dir="ltr">Roblox developers announced plans to introduce comprehensive age verification for all players who wish to communicate in-game. The verification will use "a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent."</p><p dir="ltr">Roblox detailed the upcoming changes in a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman, which it published on its website. In the statement, Kaufman claims the new methods will provide a more accurate age estimate than user input alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Once these system are in place, Roblox has promised to introduce more safety tools to prevent children from playing with adults who they don't know in real life. The announcement touts that Roblox has introduced over 100 safety tools to the platform since January 2025, including an open source AI system called "Roblox Sentinel" that's meant to detect early signs of child endangerment.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement does not outline a more specific timetable for these changes or address any privacy concerns players may have.</p><p dir="ltr">"We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow," the statement reads.</p><p dir="ltr">The change will make Roblox compliant with the UK's Online Safety Act, which passed in early August.</p><p dir="ltr">These changes come after Roblox has come under legislative scrutiny.

<section><p>And Roger isn't very accessible, but maybe that's the point.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">How does one properly deal with grief? The grief of recollecting beautiful memories, knowing they can never return. The grief of watching the life you built for yourself drastically slip away. The grief of seeing a loved one lose themselves to dementia. I've lived these moments. The pain of watching my grandfather, the kindest and gentlest man in my life, lose his entire personality and identity to dementia. The worst part is arguably watching the disease progress, seeing him lose more and more every year. Yet, throughout these powerful and intense moments of grief, love shines through in every scenario. This is the excellence of And Roger, a visual novel that swept me away with its brilliant gameplay and masterful storytelling, and for the first time in my life, made me reconsider how I critique inaccessibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for And Roger to follow.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Developed by TearyHand Studio, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/and-roger/" data-ref-id="5000-654160">And Roger</a> follows a couple as the wife, Sofia, progressively loses herself to dementia. The hour-long game, composed of three chapters, recounts moments throughout Sofia's life, particularly those associated with her husband, Roger. Players see the evolution of the couple's life together, performing varying quick-time events to progress the story. Yet, with each loving and tender core memory, the shadows of Sofia's disability continuously lurk.</p><p dir="ltr">But I'm not here to explore the emotional depth of one of the most powerful games I've ever played. Rather, I want to explore something that continually struck me as I completed each minigame: how a lack of accessibility, ultimately leading me to struggle, made the story much more impactful. The power of this short experience was so great that it made me reflect on my own beliefs and journalistic practices as both a disability reporter and disabled gamer. How I view accessibility will forever be changed because of this game.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Love and quick time events</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">And Roger begins with Sofia as a small child, struggling to wake herself. She tells herself she's exhausted and dizzy--that her body feels abnormally heavy. The music during this sequence is haunting and made me feel uneasy, as if I were about to enter a horror game. Instead, I found myself thrown into the game's first QTE, which required me to rapidly press a white button to sit Sofia up. Like Sofia, I struggled immensely to click the button on the screen. With every slip, she would fall back into her bed, forcing me to start over. And after completing the task, I felt drained, barely able to move my hand across the mouse. My stamina mirrored hers, yet this was only the beginning; as she slowly forced herself into the bathroom, we were confronted by another minigame: brushing her teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">After finishing that sequence, players are introduced to a strange man that Sofia mistakes for her father. He appears friendly, instructing her to go about her day and eat breakfast. The interactions are tense, with one minigame consisting of the strange man feeding Sofia, much to her objection. The uneasiness builds, with the stranger asking Sofia to take some medication to feel better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834"></a><figcaption>Sofia sleepily brushes her teeth in And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a scared child, she resists. And the QTE expertly reflects her struggles to fight. Again, by rapidly pressing a button, players are meant to push the man's hand away. The event itself was impossible to complete without outside assistance. Like Sofia, I felt powerless, completely unable to budge the extended hand until someone else was able to take control. After the event, I felt considerably weaker, but I continued to play, leading Sofia out of the apartment and into a bakery where she collapses at the sight and smells of a presumably safe space.</p><p dir="ltr">The bakery remains a key setting, both in terms of QTEs and core memories. Chapter Two begins with Sofia entering the bakery to purchase baked goods; There she meets Roger, and the connection is immediate. The ensuing dates consist of QTEs ranging from moving dials to choose a hairstyle, to tracing heart monitor lines as the two talk. It's a beautiful way to explore their blooming relationship, and the games expertly reflect the tenderness and fragility of new love.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these sections, Chapter Two beautifully demonstrates the importance of love and finding joy. Yet the struggles of dementia are ever present, and one QTE abruptly and forcibly brought me back into Sofia's current world.</p><p dir="ltr">Food is integral to the relationship between Sofia and Roger. Their romance began at the bakery, and numerous QTEs--from chopping vegetables to shifting dials to purchase bread--reflect this special bond. In one scene, players are required to spin a button around a pot, stirring the soup inside. If the button falls outside of the ring, the meter to complete the objective progressively depletes. On numerous occasions, my strength and stamina levels would fail to keep up with continuously spinning a button. After approximately 10 minutes and several breaks, I finished the task, once again leaving me physically exhausted. And after finishing and eating the meal, Sofia mimicked my energy levels, dropping the pot of soup on the floor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Inaccessibility as a tool</h2><p dir="ltr">I've been professionally critiquing accessibility in games for six years. My reviews always focus on what is or isn't included, and how the lack of appropriate options or designs make games unplayable. With And Roger, I found myself conflicted with my own ethics and morals as a disability reporter. As someone who regularly pushes back on the belief that accessibility can ruin artistic vision, I struggled coming to terms with the fact that, in this instance, inaccessibility had made the game so much more profound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837"></a><figcaption>Sofia says she feels like she forgot something in a still for And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players are meant to feel Sofia's struggles as she navigates her world. We're meant to feel her exhaustion, frustration, and animosity toward people and activities that once brought so much light into her life. And for me, someone with a physical disability, struggling to perform and finish certain QTEs only enhanced my connection with her. Do I recommend more games adopt this practice of forgoing accessibility? Absolutely not. But for this specific work of art, the emotional journey was vastly improved because I struggled to play.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger wants players to appreciate the everyday moments in life, cherishing them on the chance they're one day outside of your control. Yet in addition to a greater appreciation for life, I also have a newfound appreciation for games and the unique way my disability interacts with them. Inaccessibility is so innately tied to the disabled experience. And Roger showed me that there is often beauty in moments of frustration.</p>
