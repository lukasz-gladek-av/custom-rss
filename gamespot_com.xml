Ahead of its release on January 16, PS5 players will get access to a preview slice for free on November 22, right on time for the weekend.</p><p>The demo, which was previously playable at this year's Tokyo Game Show, has you wielding an array of weapons as the "nameless hero" to survive in the Battle of Sishui Gate. Unlike the playable teaser in the event, there's no time limit for the console demo, and you'll be able to choose the difficulty level.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_iFXThRtls" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_iFXThRtls" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Choosing from four weapon types--sword, guandao, pudao, and wheels--you can mix and match a number of arts, gems, and accessories with them to try different combinations in the demo. Then, you can opt for a strategic approach by acting as a commander for a number of allies, or by jumping into the fray solo against enemy armies.</p><p>If you've recently grabbed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>, good news, as the demo will be enhanced for the console. In case you're interested in buying the game early, preorders will also go live on November 22, including a collaboration costume inspired by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/" data-ref-id="1900-6418040">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>.</p>

                <p>Pokemon players will soon have a chance to add a shiny legendary Pokemon to their collections. Starting December 19, shiny Rayquaza will appear as a special Tera Raid boss in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>.</p><p>Once the event is underway, players will be able to encounter shiny Rayquaza in five-star Tera Raids across the Paldea region. This particular Rayquaza will be a dragon Tera type, making it vulnerable to ice, fairy, and other dragon Pokemon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxydjASgrI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QmxydjASgrI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like other special raid bosses, shiny Rayquaza can only be caught once per save file. However, you can continue to participate in the Rayquaza raids and earn additional rewards even after catching one.</p><p>The shiny Rayquaza event is scheduled to end on January 5 at 3:59 PM PT / 6:59 PM ET. Even if you miss your chance to get one during the event, The Pokemon Company notes that the legendary Pokemon "may be featured in future events or become encounterable through other methods."</p><p>Rayquaza isn't the only shiny Pokemon that players will have a chance to catch during this event. Other dark-colored shiny Pokemon such as Cetoddle, Carbink, and Fraxure will also be appearing more frequently in mass outbreaks across Paldea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy, respectively.</p><p>Scarlet and Violet are also hosting several other in-game events in the lead up to shiny Rayquaza's arrival, including a Chansey mass outbreak starting November 28. You can see the full event schedule on the games' <a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/shiny-rayquaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>

                <p>More than a year after Baldur's Gate 3 originally launched in August 2023, the game is still putting up impressive numbers, and has even sold one additional copy to someone who may know Pope Francis.</p><p>Larian publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some new Baldur's Gate 3 stats on social media recently</a>, beginning with how the game's average daily peak concurrent players are up 3% this year compared to last year. That likely has to do with the introduction of mods earlier this year, Douse said. Mods have proven to be extremely popular in Baldur's Gate 3, as players have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">downloaded more than 50 million of them</a>.</p><p>Daily active users, meanwhile, are up more than 20% over last year's numbers, while average daily Steam Deck users have increased 61% year-over-year. It's not clear if Douse is talking about Steam numbers specifically with all of these stats, or if they also include data from the Xbox and PlayStation versions.</p><p>These statistics are all well and good and speak to the ongoing and growing popularity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">one of 2023's best games</a>. But the real standout statistic is that Larian sold precisely one more copy in The Holy See, and specifically the Vatican itself. "Thank you Mr. Pope and enjoy the game," Douse said.</p><p>Earlier in November, Douse revealed that Larian had sold two copies of Baldur's Gate 3 in The Vatican, and that the game <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was on one other wishlist</a>. Perhaps that person has now decided to buy the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/holy-see-vatican-city/#people-and-society" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to the CIA</a>, about 1,000 people lived in Vatican City in 2022. The safest bet is that a regular person bought Baldur's Gate 3, not the Pope himself. But imagine if he did?</p><p>Pope Francis met with popular YouTubers, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pope-now-has-at-least-one-video-game-this-one/1100-6441528/" data-ref-id="1100-6441528">one person gave him a copy of the indie RPG Undertale</a>. Pope Francis is not the first world leader to have been gifted a video game. In 2011, Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110469-Polish-Prime-Minister-Gives-Obama-Witcher-2" rel="nofollow " data-ref-id="false">gave United States president Barack Obama a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>.</p><p>Following the smashing success of Baldur's Gate 3, some might have expected Larian to make Baldur's Gate 4, but the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">making something else next instead.</a> "We're working on it. If we're brutally honest, we're trying to figure out what the hell it is," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">Larian boss Swen Vincke said in May</a>. "We have ideas. We have lots of little fragments."</p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Syndicate: 60 FPS Console Update Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft didn't give a reason for why this update was coming now, nearly a decade later, but encouraged players to "discover, or rediscover, this classic on new generation consoles."</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Syndicate is set in London during the Industrial Revolution and was the first entry in the series to let players choose between two different protagonists, twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob excels at close-range combat, while Evie specializes in stealth, letting players pick which character matches their playstyle or may be better suited to a specific type of mission. Syndicate is the ninth entry in the longrunning Ubisoft franchise and was the follow-up to 2014's poorly received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-unity/" data-ref-id="5000-253830">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>--criticized at launch for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-fix-assassin-s-creed-unity-bug/1100-6423555/" data-ref-id="1100-6423555">numerous (and often hilarious) bugs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft recently delayed the next main entry in the series, the feudal Japan-based Assassin's Creed Shadows, in order to further "polish and refine the experience" following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"softer than expected" reception to Ubisoft's previous big open-world game, Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Originally slated to release this November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive February 14, 2025</a>. Much like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Shadows will let players freely swap between two different protagonists, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">the African samurai Yasuke or the ninja-like Naoe</a>.</p>
