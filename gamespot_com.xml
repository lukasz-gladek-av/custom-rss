                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-nearing-50-billion-deal-with-saudi-arabia-and-other-investors-to-go-private-report/1100-6535057/" data-ref-id="1100-6535057">rumors</a> were true: Electronic Arts has announced that it's sold itself in a $55 billion deal. EA sold itself to an "investor consortium" made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake.</p><p>EA said the all-cash deal "positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment." EA CEO Andrew Wilson is still on board as CEO.</p><p>The investor consortium will take over 100% of EA. The PIF already had a 9.9% stake in EA prior to this deal.</p><p>It's a good day for EA stockholders, too, as they are getting $210 per share in cash as part of the deal--that's a significant premium over what the stock was trading for last week.</p><p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," Wilson said. "Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</p><p>PIF's Turqi Alnowaiser said, "This partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale."</p><p>Affinity's Egon Durban shared an enthusiastic quote, too. He said, "The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business, and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations."</p><p>As for Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law said, "Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future."</p><p>The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wide range of human rights violations</a>. The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group, has invested in or acquired numerous gaming companies over the years. Before EA, Savvy bought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Pokemon Go developer Niantic's gaming division for $3.5 billion</a>. The company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/" data-ref-id="1100-6513000">owns mobile and social gaming giant Scopely, paying $4.9 billion.</a></p><p>The PIF also owns stakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabias-400-billion-wealth-fund-invests-in-ea-activision-blizzard-and-take-two/1100-6487651/" data-ref-id="1100-6487651">Activision Blizzard, Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/" data-ref-id="1100-6504587">Embracer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-5-of-nintendo/1100-6503575/" data-ref-id="1100-6503575">Nintendo</a>.</p><p>The deal to buy EA is now the No. 2 biggest acquisition in the history of gaming, and one of the largest in any business sector of all time. The biggest gaming buyout ever was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">Microsoft's $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">have made it pretty clear</a> that they don't want the game to follow in the footsteps of Call of Duty with its celebrity operators and cartoon-like skins featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis and Butt-head</a>. Now, EA and Battlefield Studios appear to be poking fun at Call of Duty with a live-action Battlefield 6 trailer that introduces some celebrities soldiers before ruthlessly dispatching them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EunkRPRzECg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett play themselves as the warriors who prove to be expendable in more ways than one. This video appears to be a callback to Call of Duty's "There's A Soldier In All Of Us" series of trailers that featured all manner of celebrities, including Sam Worthington, Jonah Hill, and Dwight Howard. The celebrities operators had a much easier time in that video than they did with Battlefield 6's urban chaos and destructible locations.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has already had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-new-campaign-trailer-featuring-tons-of-explosions-during-state-of-play/1100-6534997/" data-ref-id="1100-6534997">a launch trailer for its campaign</a>, which highlighted the extent that bringing down buildings can reshape the game. Another trailer put the spotlight on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-what-battlefield-6s-portal-mode-can-let-you-create-in-wild-new-trailer/1100-6535026/" data-ref-id="1100-6535026">Battlefield 6's Portal mode</a>. That's the part of the game that puts tools in the hands of players and lets them create customized maps that inject more chaos into the battles.</p><p>DICE boss Rebecka Coutaz recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-felt-an-obligation-to-make-a-better-game-after-2042-stumbled/1100-6534972/" data-ref-id="1100-6534972">she felt an obligation</a> to deliver a greatly improved incarnation of Battlefield following the disappointing response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. GameSpot has shared its<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-story-campaign-lets-you-have-fun-with-destruction-when-it-wants-to/1100-6534987/" data-ref-id="1100-6534987"> first impressions of the game</a>, following a hands-on preview. Fans will be able to get their chance to weigh in when Battlefield 6 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.</p>
