                <p>AT CES 2025, Microsoft VP of Next Generation Jason Ronald teased a refreshed user experience for Windows handheld gaming PCs: one that could combine the best aspects of its operating system and Xbox. While Windows 11 allows for more choice--users can access Steam, Epic Games Store, and several other marketplaces--it can be a chore to use because it is natively designed for PCs and laptops--not handheld systems with much smaller screens.</p><p>"We've been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it's really about how do we bring those innovations that we've incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space," Ronald said an AMD and Lenovo event (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>). "I would say it's bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it's really locked to the console. What we're doing is we're really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem."</p><p>Ronald explained that Microsoft aims to bring a console-like experience to handhelds and "make Windows great for gaming" on any device. Microsoft will have more details to share later in the year, Ronald said, adding that the idea is to move away from a Windows desktop setup on handhelds and toward a "gaming-centric" experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox chief Phil Spencer has candidly spoken about the idea of a Xbox handheld device for several month, and it has been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">Microsoft is currently working on a prototype</a> that is still years away from being released. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/" data-ref-id="1100-6528686">Valve's SteamOS is coming to more PC gaming handhelds</a>, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S later this year.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy VII is among the most beloved entries in the series, but could there one day be another film adaptation? Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase said in an interview recently that, although nothing is "officially planned," he's aware of the game's appeal in Hollywood.</p><p>Kitase told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&amp;list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&amp;index=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Pena</a> that he's "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy VII, and many creators respect the title."</p><p>Kitase added: "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe. And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."</p><p>However, he confirmed "no talks have been had" about making Final Fantasy VII into a Hollywood movie.</p><p>Square Enix has already launched a Final Fantasy VII movie, having released the 2005 anime Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Directed by veteran artist Tetsuya Nomura, the straight-to-DVD film takes place a couple years after the events of the game.</p><p>Before this, actor Robert Pattinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-stars-robert-pattinson-john-david-washington/1100-6481355/" data-ref-id="1100-6481355">Final Fantasy VII was one of his favorite video games, pointing out how it made him cry</a>. He also discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-pattinson-discusses-final-fantasy-7-love-triangle/1100-6501075/" data-ref-id="1100-6501075">being in love with both Aeris and Tifa in a love triangle.</a></p><p>While there is no new Final Fantasy VII movie in the works right now, Hollywood is pressing ahead with numerous adaptations. Just this week, Sony announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-are-officially-in-development/1100-6528663/" data-ref-id="1100-6528663">movie versions of Helldivers and Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/" data-ref-id="1100-6528665">Until Dawn movie</a>, meanwhile, debuts this April, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-director-explains-why-it-isnt-called-the-minecraft-movie/1100-6527977/" data-ref-id="1100-6527977">A Minecraft Movie comes out the same month.</a></p><p>As for the game series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the newest extension of the popular game, itself serving as a sequel to 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake. A third entry in the remake series is now in the works.</p>

                <p>It's official: Valve's SteamOS will be available on more platforms soon, and the first handheld PC gaming device to adopt the operating system will be the new Lenovo Legion Go S. At CES 2025, it was revealed that the slim Lenovo unit will run on the Linux-based OS--, the same one used on Valve's Steam Deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg"></figure><p>The big draw here is that SteamOS is more intuitive to use and better suited for smaller screens when compared to its Windows 11 counterparts. While you are losing out on the flexibility of being able to load games from multiple storefronts, SteamOS makes up for it by being quick and easy to use thanks to its design. Essentially, if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play handheld gaming PC that isn't a chore to use and you don't mind sticking to Steam, these new Lenovo devices could be perfect for you.</p><p>As for the new Lenovo model, the Legion Go S looks like it'll be a direct competitor to the Steam Deck thanks to several hardware changes. Most notable is that it won't offer Switch-like removable controllers, but it will keep the small trackpad found underneath the face buttons. These handhelds will be flexing some impressive power thanks to the new AMD Z2 Go chip. These will also be equipped with a 120Hz variable-refresh-rate display and customizable levers on the rear.</p><p>Lenovo will launch a $730 model equipped with a Windows OS, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of RAM first, and another Windows OS version with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for $600 in May. The SteamOS Legion Go S is also planned to launch in May, and while exact hardware specs haven't been confirmed yet, we do know that it'll be priced at $500. Additionally, Valve will support it with SteamOS updates.</p>
