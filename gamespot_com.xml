                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 players can rejoice as cross-play will be introduced with the game's next big update, Patch 8. Fans have been clamoring for cross-play capabilities for a while and soon PC players can join in with their console-playing friends--but that's not all. The patch also includes a brand-new photo mode and 12 new subclasses to use in the fight against the Absolute.</p><p>Stress testing for the update will go up in early January, and players will have the opportunity to sign up for it before then. The information for when and where will be available with the company's next Community Update. There's no word on when Patch 8 will release in full.</p><p>With cross-play, much like with other online games, players will be able to invite their friends to join a cross-play lobby directly, regardless of platform. They can also find other available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network.</p><p>As for the subclasses, some are fan favorites from the tabletop version of Dungeons and Dragons, and others have been homebrewed in the game, such as Drunken Master. You can read more about each class over at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page for the game</a>, but here's the list:</p><ul><li>Bard - College of Glamour</li><li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li><li>Cleric - Death Domain</li><li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li><li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li><li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li><li>Monk - Drunken Master</li><li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li><li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li><li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li><li>Warlock - Hexblade</li><li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li></ul><p>Lastly, the all-new Photo Mode has a whole slew of options to let players customize and edit their in-game photos. Whether you're using it while adventuring, taking on your enemies, dialogue, or even cinematic scenes, players can grab a pic of their Tav and party. It will even include frames and the ability to use stickers with over 300 emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects, and items to choose from to decorate your image just right.</p><p>Larian confirmed that it will be wrapping up its heavy-duty updates for Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 soon, but it reassured players that is not the end for its mod tools.</p><p>"With the continued support of mod authors in the community testing out new features, we have big updates still to come including adding even more functionality to let you tell your own stories," Larian said in a statement.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 is currently on sale for $48, with the Digital Deluxe Edition DLC also on sale for $8 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the game industry prepares for Geoff Keighley's annual smorgasbord of news from The Game Awards, Devolver Digital has decided it's not going to wait until next month. Today, the publisher released Devolver Delayed 2024, a tongue-in-cheek awards show recognizing three games that have been pushed to 2025: Baby Steps, Stick It To The Stickman, and Skate Story.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game's delay was announced as a specific "award" given to the game against other fictional nominees. Specifically, the awards were named as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Best Inadvertent Tripping Simulator</strong> - Baby Steps</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Best Late Stage Capitalism Roguelite</strong> - Stick It To The Stickman</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Best Glass Demon In A Leading Role</strong> - Skate Story</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4406334-baby-steps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406334" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4406334-baby-steps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406334"></a><figcaption>Baby Steps, winner of Best Inadvertent Tripping Simulator</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4406334-baby-steps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The "awards ceremony" then proceeded to a fourth award, <strong>Best Color Version Of A Monochromatic Classic</strong>. The winner was the previously unknown Volvy's Adventure DX, with a brief gameplay teaser showing an 8-bit side-scrolling platformer starring Devolver's rat-like mascot.</p><p dir="ltr">The presentation never actually confirms the game's existence, and Inscryption creator Daniel Mullins specifically says he "doesn't even think it's a real game" when he appears to receive the award for some unexplained reason, so whether or not Volvy's Adventure DX actually exists remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">All three of the confirmed games in the presentation--Baby Steps, Stick It To The Stickman, and Skate Story--will now be launching in 2025 after being previously announced for a 2024 release window. Baby Steps was first unveiled at the Devolver Digital Showcase in June 2023, while both Skate Story and Stick It To The Stickman debuted the previous year.</p>
