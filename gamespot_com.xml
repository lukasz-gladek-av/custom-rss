                <p>Sony shed more light on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-drops-predecessors-samurai-combat-to-make-atsu-a-walking-arsenal/1100-6533101/" data-ref-id="1100-6533101">its State of Play</a> earlier this week. While the focus of the event was primarily on the gameplay and story, there's something special coming for fans of the game. Now, Sony has unveiled the first look at the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition PlayStation 5 bundles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpy0vfXXnd8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpy0vfXXnd8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two options for fans: Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and Ghost of Yotei Black Limited Edition Bundle. The Black model will be exclusively available through PlayStation's official store, while the Gold model will be sold everywhere else. Both bundles include a disc drive, a matching DualSense controller, and a digital copy of Ghost of Yoeti with all preorder bonuses.</p><p>The dev team at Sucker Punch designed both limited editions, and noted that the Gold bundle was inspired by the Japanese art form known as kintsugi, which is used to repair broken objects with gold and lacquer. The Black bundle's look was taken from another Japanese art form called Sumi-e, which puts black ink on paintings.</p><p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," noted Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connell. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. The towering Mount Yotei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs."</p><p>Fans who already have a PS5 slim or PS5 Pro will be able to purchase Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition console covers through PlayStation's store. The designs for the DualSense controller will also be available as a separate purchase.</p><p>Both of the limited editions, the console covers, and the controller designs will debut alongside Ghost of Yotei on October 2.</p>
