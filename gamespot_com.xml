The writer also talked about why he believes Borderlands 4 represents the "Simpsons era" for the team.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/gearbox-talks-borderlands-4-exploration-fixing-the-meme-humor-and-entering-the-series-simpsons-era/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to VGC</a>, Clark said Gearbox was "of course" aware of the feedback from Borderlands 3 regarding its jokes and general tone. "We took all the valid criticism on board. We're creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet we're on."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official New Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Borderlands 3's world of Pandora was like "the Wild West," but the planet of Kairos for Borderlands 4 is a "totalitarian world." As such, "Having everybody making jokes every minute wouldn't totally feel right," Clark said. This follows on from the game's narrative director saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">fans should not expect Skibidi toilet or Hawk Tuah jokes in Borderlands 4.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">GameSpot </a>that Gearbox is "really proud" of its past titles and the jokes and general humor in them. However, Nicholson said the world is different today, in 2025, and while Borderlands 4 aims to be "very humorous," the humor is trying to be more grounded.</p><p>"We now make sure that the Vault Hunters themselves are the ones who are driving [the jokes] and they're the ones who are being [funny]. So when we say [Borderlands 4] has grounded humor, we mean it's more situational comedy between [the Vault Hunters] as opposed to pulling things out from the real world and things like that [like the series used to]," Nicholson explained.</p><h2><strong>Simpsons era</strong></h2><p>Clark went on to say that Gearbox is entering its "Simpsons era" with Borderlands 4, in that the studio has written so much material over the years that it's a big job to try to find new storytelling.</p><p>"We're in the writers' room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, 'We did that in Borderlands,'" he said. "We're always trying not to repeat ourselves; that's why our villains are so different. We're always trying to keep it fresh."</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later. The game's standard edition costs $70, not $80--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">this makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford very happy.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo has released the first major post-launch patch for its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>. Patch Ver. 1.1.1 is primarily focused on bug fixes, rather than adding any substantial new content.</p><p>Like most first-party Nintendo titles, Mario Kart World felt very refined and polished at release, with GameSpot calling it a "massive, sprawling sequel that playfully expands and iterates on the qualities that made Mario Kart 8 Deluxe such an enduring success," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">in our review</a>. Still, some bugs still slipped through the cracks, like ones that occasionally prevented items from being used, crashed the game after watching a replay or doing an Online Play race, or couldn't properly control your character in Free Roam. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>Fixed Issues</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where items were no longer able to be used.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when selecting a character and trying to start Free Roam from the “Free Roam” map.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down when watching replay after a race.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down after a race in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Knockout Tour” and “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where it was easy for a communication error to occur when trying to join Friends playing “VS Race” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes slipped through the wall before the finish line of “DK Spaceport.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes couldn’t return to correct position after falling of the course between “Airship Fortress” and “Bowser’s Castle” while gliding.</li></ul><p>If you were hoping that Ver. 1.1.1 of Mario Kart World would add some new content to Free Roam or any of the other modes, you're out of luck. At this time, Nintendo has not revealed any post-launch update plans for Mario Kart World outside of these bug-fixing patches.</p><p>This update is out now and should automatically download. If it doesn't, make sure you're connected to the internet and press the + or - button on your controller over Mario Kart World's game icon. From there, navigate to the Software Update sub-menu and choose to update "Via the Internet."</p><p>Mario Kart World is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2. There's a lot to discover in the game, including the iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-decades-old-nintendo-easter-egg-has-surfaced-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532489/" data-ref-id="1100-6532489">Totaka's Song easter egg</a> common in Nintendo games and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-harkens-back-to-super-mario-64-for-unlocking-free-roam-mirror-mode/1100-6532313/" data-ref-id="1100-6532313">Mirror Mode</a> that flips the entirety of the Free Roam open world.  </p>

It's a fairly small update, mainly consisting of bug fixes for combat and boss fights, along with one balance adjustment that increases the chance of obtaining weapons with the Madness status ailment.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the next big Switch 2 game, landing firmly within "launch window" status next month. Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said "Donkey Kong lore" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City. In this game she looks no more than 10 years old or so and hangs off DK's back as a companion character. Pauline has a dream, and DK is being exploited by his capitalist overlords, so together they head toward the planet core to make a wish. All completely normal so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the presence of a young Pauline implies that this is a prequel of sorts. DK has been rehabilitated from his villainous persona in the original Donkey Kong for years, but buddying up with Pauline as a little girl suggests that there was more to the story than we knew. As of the time when DK grabbed her and carried her to the top of a tower and forced Jump Man (aka Mario) to rescue her, they had a history. They were old friends! The mind reels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074"></a><figcaption>In Soviet Russia, monkey has person on his back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But then, the Bananza presentation threw another curveball by revealing that you can meet Cranky Kong. Now wait just a damn minute. What the hell is going on here?</p><p dir="ltr">As DK enthusiasts may recall, Cranky Kong is canonically the <em>original</em> Donkey Kong: The DK we've been playing throughout the Donkey Kong Country games, the one who is pals with Diddy Kong and the rest, is actually his more charismatic grandson. It was Cranky Kong who grabbed Pauline and climbed the tower and squared off against Jump Man.</p><p dir="ltr">So you may start to see the problem here. If old Cranky Kong is in this game, Pauline should be an adult. If Pauline is a kid, then Donkey Kong should be a slightly younger Cranky Kong who, 10 or so years in the future, will grab her and climb a bunch of girders. Having a fully-aged Cranky Kong and a young girl Pauline appear in the same game makes <em>absolutely no sense</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are ways to make it work. Donkey Kong Bananza could imply some kind of time-travel element in which Cranky Kong was sucked back into the past to meet his younger self. That possibility seems bananas, but frankly no more so than anything else we've seen from this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The more likely possibility in my mind, though, is that this version of Donkey Kong, Pauline, and Cranky Kong are entirely separate and distinct from the precious original continuity. Donkey Kong Bananza appears to be a sort of DK reboot, remixing familiar elements into a new continuity that is not bound by any of the storytelling conventions of the original. In other words: We've entered the DK multiverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe Nintendo is just making it up as they go. I may be overthinking this.</p>

The movie is being billed as similar in tone to the adult-focused anime movies like Predator: Killer of Killers and the upcoming John Wick animated prequel.</p><p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," Guzikowski said.</p><p>Line Mileage is producing the Death Stranding anime. CCO Daniel Dominguez said he believes Death Stranding is "the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game" he's ever played.</p><p>"Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell," he added.</p><p>It's still early days for the Death Stranding anime, and there is no word yet as to who is directing or lending their voices to the production. As for the live-action movie, Kojima is working with A24, with Michael Sarnoski (Pig, A Quiet Place: Day One) set to direct. Neither movie has a release date yet.</p><p>As for the Death Stranding game series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> releases on June 26 for PS5.</p>
