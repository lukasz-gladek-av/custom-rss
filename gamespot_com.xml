These modern reimaginings of the original Red, Blue, and Yellow versions feature an adorable art style and new catching mechanics.

This is another remake, this time of the Nintendo DS game Pokemon Pearl. Unlike the Let's Go remakes, Shining Pearl sticks much closer to the gameplay of the original version, instead simply updating the visuals and making small tweaks to the experience, rather than shaking things up with new content or game mechanics.

The update also quietly removes one of Call of Duty's most annoying weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">The riot shield is a loadout weapon that's received a lot of hate over the years, as the bullet-deflecting shield is a frustrating weapon to counter in both multiplayer and Warzone. However, players have quickly noticed that the riot shield is gone in Warzone.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857085864074969582" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">As of now, the Riot Shield is gone from Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857085864074969582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's weapon pool doesn't include a riot shield, but all of the weapons from Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 were part of Call of Duty's Carry Forward plan for the game's integration into Warzone. When customizing a loadout, players can cycle through all of the guns and melee weapons for all three games, but the Modern Warfare 2 riot shield seems to be the only item missing.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-anti-cheat-and-weapon-changes/2900-5947/" data-ref-id="2900-5947">The Season 1 patch notes</a> don't address the removal of the riot shield, so it's uncertain if this was an intentional decision, or if the riot shield was accidentally left out with Black Ops 6's integration.</p><p dir="ltr">The riot shield has been a part of Warzone since launch, so while there are probably plenty of players rejoicing the shield's disappearance, there will likely be some fans missing out on their riot-shield strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 of Warzone also adds the brand-new Area 99 Resurgence map, and for the first time ever, the game now has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-mastery-camos-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527349/" data-ref-id="1100-6527349">unique Mastery camo grind</a>.

Zombies won't receive a new map until Season 1 Reloaded, but the new update does add the ability to purchase Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 returns the Gobblegum system from the Zombies mode in Black Ops 3, and it includes special gumballs that offer a range of temporary or one-time use abilities to help in the fight against zombie hordes. Some Gobblegums can help players upgrade their weapon rarity, give them free perks, revive teammates, or even teleport them away from danger.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719"></a><figcaption>Season 1 Gobblegum packs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 update to Black Ops 6 brings plenty of new cosmetic bundles to the in-game shop, and this includes Gobblegum packs for Zombies players. As of right now, the shop contains a small assortment of packs ranging from 200 CoD Points ($2) for a pack of three gums to a large pack of 12 high-end Gobblegums for 1,100 CoD Points ($10).</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's definitely worth noting that the Gobblegums are an optional loadout item, and Black Ops 6 makes it easier than past years to earn free Gobblegums. Players earn the gums randomly while playing Zombies, and there are even double-XP events that can sometimes increase the Gobblegum earn rate.</p><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums are featured in the Season 1 battle pass, and they'll likely be available as rewards in future events as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 battle pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-battle-pass-includes-dlc-weapons-sev-operator-and-new-blackcell/2900-5944/">features over 100 items to unlock</a>, including two new weapons, Sev as a playable operator, and plenty of cosmetic weapon blueprints.
