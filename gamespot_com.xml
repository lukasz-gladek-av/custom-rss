                <p>Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous and groundbreaking creative types across all of entertainment, but the man himself doesn't agree that he's a genius. As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion that he's been able for decades to turn out hit after hit because he's a "genius."</p><p>"You referred to me as a 'genius,' but I consider myself quite ordinary," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to say he gives a speech each year to Nintendo's new hires, and the feedback he gets from these people is that he is "surprisingly ordinary."</p><p>Making great games allows Miyamoto to have an easier career, he said. "I often think it would be fun if I didn't have to work, so I'm always thinking about things like, well, if I have to work, how can I do it more efficiently. And if I am going to do the same work, how can I make it more of a hit, because when a project is a hit it makes future work easier," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to reveal more of what he tells new hires coming to Nintendo. He said many people come to work at Nintendo and aspire to make "upgraded versions" of games they've played before. But Miyamoto pushes back against this idea and encourages them to think differently.</p><p>"[Game design] is about observing the world around us and figuring out how to assemble those elements into an engaging video game," he said. "I explain that game design is about planning. That is, it is about assessing what hardware and development environment to use to create the game, whether the desired game can be realized with its available processing power, and engaging in trial and error to bring it to life."</p><p>Miyamoto has had a long and illustrious career at Nintendo. The 71-year-old started at Nintendo all the way back in 1977 and helped create Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda. He's remained a key player at Nintendo to this day in his "Creative Fellow" position, contributing to all manner of Nintendo game franchises. In addition to his work on Nintendo's game franchises, he was an executive producer on 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will produce the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Legend of Zelda film.</a> He's also involved in the Nintendo theme parks.</p><p>Miyamoto has no plans to retire, but has admitted he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">spent time thinking about who may fill his shoes</a> one day.</p><p>As for Nintendo's hardware business, the Switch is now in its eighth year on the market. It's sold more than 146 million units worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">all eyes are on Nintendo to reveal the Switch 2 by April 2025. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Just a tad over a week since launching, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket has hit a major milestone: 30-plus million downloads. It's also the No. 1 free game on the App Store and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a>, topping other mobile juggernauts like Roblox and Monopoly Go.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1854728092717129756" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, the official Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket account revealed the impressive download number and thanked players for "your support." A question was also pondered: "How many packs have been opened, then?"</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1854728092717129756" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">T-t-t-thirty million?! ðŸ™Œ How many packs have been opened, then?ðŸ¤” <br>On behalf of everyone working on the game and me, thank you for all your support!

The thought is that when tearing open one of your daily free packs that you should inspect the packaging for any imperfections, like a bent corner. These will then lead to a greater chance for rare cards. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, internet response has been mixed on the success rate for utilizing this strategy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket launched</a> on October 30, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-announced-for-mobile-devices/1100-6521387/" data-ref-id="1100-6521387">the app was unveiled in February</a> during Pokemon Day.

Earlier this week, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">Pokemon game sales have reached 99 million copies on Switch</a>.

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the state of the AAA video game market, saying "it's hard and getting harder."

And that's true of all entertainment businesses as they begin to mature," he said. "The quality threshold that the consumer demands always goes up."</p><p>Zelnick claimed Take-Two is uniquely positioned to succeed in this challenging market because its core goals are to be the "most

But Zelnick agreed that, as the video game industry has matured, the "quality demands" of players have increased over time.</p><p>Take-Two makes AAA games, and not just any AAA games, but some of the biggest in gaming. Take-Two's next big release is 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is arguably the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">most anticipated video game in history</a> and one that no doubt carried a significant development budget.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden recently commented on the state of the AAA video game industry, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying</a>, "If we're just going to rely on the blockbusters to get us through, I think that's a death sentence."</p><p>Layden said rising development costs for AAA games have encouraged studio executives to make safe bets, leading to a "collapse in creativity."</p><p>Take-Two makes sequels, but also believes in funding new IP. In fact, Zelnick also recently said that if Take-Two doesn't invest in new IP, the company runs the risk of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-company-says-only-relying-on-sequels-could-spell-disaster/1100-6527627/" data-ref-id="1100-6527627">"burning the furniture to heat the house, and that doesn't end well."</a></p><p>As for Star Wars: Outlaws, many believed the game would be as close to a guaranteed hit as there could be given the popularity of the Star Wars series and the appetite for single-player games. However, Outlaws <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">underperformed Ubisoft's expectations</a>. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-3-areas-ubisoft-is-trying-to-improve-after-slow-start/1100-6527565/" data-ref-id="1100-6527565">isn't giving up on the game, however. </a></p>

                <p>The open-world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is built on rules, but what happens when they're broken? One modder was so obsessed with making horses and carriages move at supersonic speeds that they didn't stop to consider the consequences, and it looks like the mod has led to some homicidal horseplay. No matter where you are in the game, you'll never be safe as this mod sure likes to stirrup trouble.</p><p>As demonstrated by <a href="https://x.com/Blurbstv/status/1854590427024048422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlurbsTV</a>, their mod turns Red Dead Redemption 2 into a horror spectacle that Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14H_QpiPt8I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/14H_QpiPt8I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Think you can mind your own business on a desolate stretch of land?
