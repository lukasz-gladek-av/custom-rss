                <p>Every mainline Final Fantasy game introduces its own lore and cast of characters to the franchise, and Final Fantasy XVI is no exception. Set in Valisthea, a world of magic, cruel gods, and powerful Eikons, Final Fantasy XVI features one of the most mature and gritty settings of the mainline series--but still offers the expansive worldbuilding and fantastical themes the series is known for, along with unique interpretations of Final Fantasy staples like Moogles, Chocobos, crystals, and more. If you want to learn more about Valisthea, you can revisit Final Fantasy XVI's setting with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI</a>. As the title implies, this hardcover book will offer a deeper look at Final Fantasy XVI's many kingdoms, factions, and characters when it launches on March 31, 2026. Preorders are discounted to $39.80 (normally $45) at Amazon.</p><div title="6533224 - Logos: The World of Final Fantasy 16" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3909" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533224 - Logos: The World of Final Fantasy 16" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$39.80 (was $45) | Releases March 31, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI is a massive 368-page hardcover book, explores everything from history to geography, music to cooking, and much more. Rather than simply being an encyclopedia cataloging the world of Valisthea, the book is written from the perspective of Valisthean scholar Harpocrates II Hyperboreos--a character you'll encounter frequently in Final Fantasy XVI--with numerous in-world journal entries, letters, and character conversations presented in illustrated full-color pages. Many of the entries are even penned by Final Fantasy XVI voice actors Ben Starr (Clive), Stewart Clarke (Dion), and Christopher York (Gav).</p>                      </div><p>If you're looking to build your own Final Fantasy library, you can pair Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Final-Fantasy-XVI/dp/1646092368?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Art of Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Published last year, the massive hardcover art book offers hundreds of pages of concept art, illustrations, and behind-the-scenes development materials for the game. The book is currently on sale for just $22, a nice 45% discount compared to its normal $40 price. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646092759?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">There's also the Final Fantasy XVI Poster Art Collection book</a>, which collects 33 posters featuring illustrations from the games, including pieces of the main characters, the Eikon summons, and more.

While this gets you the base game--which will take you through the main story featuring Clive's struggle to free the world of Valisthea from the control of the giant, magical Mothercrystals--Final Fantasy XVI has also received two paid DLC expansions, Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide, that add additional side stories that flesh out the world with new characters, dungeons, side-quests, and unlockable abilities for Clive to master.

We expect to see it at other retailers, such as Target and Walmart, soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Note that the Switch 2 edition is a Game Key-Card release, meaning none of the game data is stored on the cartridge itself, and it instead works as a physical key to unlock and download the digital version to your console.

                <p>The Stop Killing Games movement hits a bit closer for Ubisoft than some companies in part because the publisher is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-facing-lawsuit-after-the-crew-was-removed-from-platforms/1100-6527713/">facing a lawsuit</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/">shutting down the servers</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-crew/" data-ref-id="5000-183626">The Crew</a> last year. During an Ubisoft shareholders meeting, CEO Yves Guillemot was asked to address the goals of Stop Killing Games and he replied that games aren't meant to "last forever."</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the text of the shareholders meeting</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>), Guillemot said, "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that's an issue that we're working on. That's something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players. But clearly that's something you need to factor in."</p><p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">started last year</a> by YouTube host Ross Scott in the aftermath of Ubisoft's decision to sunset The Crew. The movement challenges the legality and ethics of publishers' decisions to shut down games that have previously been sold to consumers. The EU lobbying association <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lobbying-group-says-stop-killing-games-petition-would-make-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create/1100-6532989/" data-ref-id="1100-6532989">Video Games Europe recently responded</a> that Stop Killing Games' proposals to keep older games alive "would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create."</p><p>Ubisoft isn't the only company taking older games offline. BioWare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/" data-ref-id="5000-465528">Anthem</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/">shutting down in January 2026</a>. Last year, Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a> only lasted a few weeks before it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/">also shut down</a>.</p>

                <p>Oh, snap! Second Dinner has officially announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>: <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/18/marvel-snaps-golden-gauntlet-world-championship-series-gives-players-a-new-way-to-compete-connect-and-shine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series</a>, a global tournament initiative launching on August 9, 2025. This free-to-enter competition is open to all players regardless of rank or experience and is aimed at bringing together the community and showcasing players' creativity. The series will be broadcast live on the game's official Twitch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p>Registration links will be shared on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Discord</a> ahead of each event, along with full rules, format, and support in dedicated channels. </p><p>The Golden Gauntlet Series will include three regional "Open Qualifier" tournaments, leading up to a global finals event in November called the Golden Gauntlet Worlds. Each regional event will follow a standardized format: Six rounds of Swiss-style playing (a fixed number of rounds, with pairings based on performance rather than elimination), followed by a top 16 single-elimination bracket, with prizes awarded to the top finishers.</p><p>After that, players who end those rounds with a 5-1 record or better will earn a spot in the final event. These qualifiers are scheduled for August, September, and October, each focusing on different global regions, ensuring as many players as possible.</p><p>Aland Failde, SVP of marketing at Second Dinner, emphasized that the tournament is a way to give back to fans and creators who have shaped the game's journey.</p><p>"From day one, Marvel Snap has been shaped by its players, and the Golden Gauntlet is our way of supporting and amplifying that passion," Failde said in a statement. "Huge shoutout to Game On Events for helping us host this event and to all the incredible community members who've helped bring this to life--this series wouldn't exist without their dedication, creativity, and love for the game."</p><p>Snap players might remember when the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">went temporarily offline</a> this past January due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). The legislation banned software owned or published by ByteDance, which owns the game's then-publisher Nuverse. The restrictions were later removed, and the developers announced that they would work with US company Skystone Games to bring publishing duties in-house.</p><p>Similarly, Matthew R.--also known for his gamertag ItsGuestGaming--co-founder of Game On Events, highlighted the tournament's evolution from grassroots efforts to a full-fledged world championship.</p><p>“Our goal with this series is to bring the community together to celebrate Marvel Snap's competitive scene while showcasing the fast, high-stakes nature of its matches," he said. "It's been exciting to watch tournaments grow from grassroots events to the Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series. Whether you've been playing for two months or two years, we're thrilled to host a tournament that honors Marvel Snap's amazing community."</p><p>The grand finale, Golden Gauntlet Worlds, will take place on November 8, 2025, featuring over 300 qualified players from the three open tournaments. This final event will consist of nine rounds of Swiss play, culminating in a Top 16 playoff to determine the ultimate champion. </p><p>As of now, there are no cards banned, but it wouldn't surprise me if they treat this like High Voltage-style and ban cards like Galactus and Magik just to speed things along.</p><p>The tournament will start a week after the last of the Fantastic Four: First Steps cards drop, giving players some time to decide if their already perfect deck could be better.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">For years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players have been wondering when the game would take them to a location teased way back before the original Destiny was even released: Old Chicago. With the release of its latest expansion, Edge of Fate, it looks like we might have at least a vague answer: soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Fate seems subtle on this point, at first. Though the story is set on Kepler, a new location flung way out toward the edge of the solar system, it deals a lot with time-bending looks back into the past, and a few hints toward the future. You get your first hint about Chicago when Lodi, the expansion's new character, gets a glimpse of the future. He mentions standing with the Guardian, Destiny's player character, on the shores of Lake Michigan--the Great Lake on whose shores Chicago is found.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the train. The campaign's opening cutscene sees series mainstay Ikora Rey nearly getting run over by a subway train seemingly zapped across time to appear in Destiny 2's far-flung futuristic post-apocalypse. Trains are all over the expansion, acting as a story touchstone, a sort of reality-bending entry point for different areas in the new location of Kepler, and the expansion's defining image.</p><p dir="ltr">That train car sure looks like Chicago's "El" train, the elevated railway that runs throughout the city, once you're primed to look for it. And if you zoom in on the Edge of Fate key art, you can see the train's destination printed above the door. It says "Ravenswood," a north Chicago neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477"></a><figcaption>See that train car in the middle of the image?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But any sleuthing becomes unnecessary when things get really explicit later on, as you near the end of the campaign. In one of the final missions, Destiny 2 mainstay Ikora Rey literally says something to the effect of, "Maybe soon we'll go to Chicago."</p><p dir="ltr">Old Chicago is a big deal to Destiny players who have been around for a while. The location has been wondered about, discussed, and even teased for years. Bungie first dropped the possibility of visiting Old Chicago back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams" rel="nofollow ">before the original Destiny was even released</a>. Since then, references to the city have come up time and again in lore and story. When Bungie first showed off images of its 2022 expansion, The Witch Queen, players speculated the location in its first trailer might be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22518875/destiny-2-witch-queen-expansion-old-chicago-screenshot-tease" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the swampy outskirts of Chicago</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It'd be a significant location to visit, because while Destiny 2 has destinations set on Earth, they're fairly nondescript. The European Dead Zone, or EDZ, takes players to a destroyed, fictional European town called Trostland. There's also the Cosmodrome, an airplane and spaceship graveyard and control facility located somewhere in Russia. But both locations are invented for Destiny 2--they don't really reference anywhere specific from our world.</p><p dir="ltr">Chicago, on the other hand, <em>would</em> be a recognizable place from our reality, and it would be the first. While the old cities of Earth are all destroyed hundreds of years before the events of Destiny 2, surely the city will still <em>look</em> like the Chicago we expect, and seeing it in its ravaged, post-alien invasion state would be interesting in and of itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476"></a><figcaption>A cutscene during Edge of Fate's campaign shows a distant city that's also the location of the Department of External Observation. Based on the landscape and the highway sign, it could be Chicago.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd also be the first American location to get Destiny 2's futuristic treatment, so we'd get to see how Bungie might play with the city and change it through the course of both hundreds of years of progress and hundreds of years of decay. That's to say nothing of what gameplay opportunities the ravaged city might afford, or story implications of the possibility of any humans still eeking out a living there.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints within the Edge of Fate campaign that Chicago could be an important location as Destiny 2's story develops, too. Cutscenes in the expansion jump back in time to Earth in what appears to be the 1960s, and one includes a distant city skyline. That city is also the apparent location of the Department of External Observation, a government agency from the past focused on the possibility of alien contact and abduction, which plays a significant role in the expansion. So if Chicago is, in fact, a future destination, it seems very likely the DEO is too.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot of speculation, but it really seems like Edge of Fate is setting up Chicago as its next big destination. If that's the case, it'll be the culmination of waiting and speculation that's lasted all of Destiny's life--almost 12 years.</p>

                <p>After a three-year silence, a developer behind the ambitious Fallout: Bakersfield has revealed a new trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-1993/" data-ref-id="5000-815">Doom</a> total conversion mod that transforms id's shooter into the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a>, and it almost looks too good to be true.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin is one of the leading developers behind the project. The mod looks to recreate Fallout 1's Ghoul city of Necropolis as a FPS campaign using GZDoom, a modified version of Doom that supports modern features like dynamic lighting, high resolution textures, better rendering, and more not possible in id's original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's immediately clear that Berezin knows the look and feel of the first two Fallout games inside and out, as the new four-minute Fallout: Bakersfield trailer perfectly captures not only the visual style and aesthetic but also the tone of original Fallout games.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the trailer shows how Berezin has blended the iconography of Doom and Fallout seamlessly together, with a UI that is immediately reminiscent of Doom (complete with a guy's face in a little box in the middle of the screen) but brilliantly melded with the Pip-Boy aesthetics of Fallout. There's even a neon green text box in the left corner of the screen that displays environmental information and damage dealt, just like in the original Fallout.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod is a non-commercial project and will be playable for free, though it might still be a while before players can get their hands on it. The end of the trailer reveals various stats about the project and estimates it to be around 60% complete. A release date shown in the trailer flickers with various question marks that slowly transform into a year. While at first it looks like the year "2027" will be displayed, it quickly swaps back to a question mark, perhaps implying that Fallout: Bakersfield's release date is still in flux.</p><p dir="ltr">While the wait for Fallout: Bakersfield might be a long one, the wait for official new Fallout games may be longer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was reported to have been recently greenlit</a> but is likely still many years away.

                <p>2023's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still getting new updates, and the next one is a big one. Ubisoft has announced that a major new update coming to the game this December will add a third-person mode and New Game Plus. The update releases on December 5, which is just ahead of the release of the next movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, on December 19.</p><p>The third-person mode allows players to see the world of Pandora from a new perspective. Ubisoft said the team at Massive Entertainment "reworked" the game's animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to support the third-person view.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bej3ockJuIc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bej3ockJuIc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The New Game Plus, meanwhile, gives players a reason to replay the story. As with other New Game+ modes, players can opt to replay the campaign while keeping their inventory and skills. The New Game+ mode also adds a new skill tree and introduces "more powerful gear."</p><p>Frontiers of Pandora is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.
