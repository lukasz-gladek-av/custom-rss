                <p>Sony's popular and longrunning professional baseball series, MLB The Show, is expanding to a new place: mobile. A new version of the game "built from the ground up" for mobile is headed to iOS and Android, with a test coming up soon in the Philippines before a global rollout later.</p><p>The regional test for the Philippines begins today, December 3, but there is no word yet on when the game will be available in more places. This kind of limited, regional rollout is common for mobile games.</p><p><a href="https://theshowmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A FAQ</a> for The Show's mobile version confirms it is a standalone game that will not support cross-play with the console editions. The game is optimized for iPhone 16 or "comparable devices" in the Apple family, along with Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V, or "comparable" phones.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a first glimpse at how the pro baseball game is being adapted for mobile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctcq_G3UclA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctcq_G3UclA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The minimum technical specifications can be seen below, and they note that iPads and tablets are not supported. The game's "soft launch" period will allow people to buy in-game currency, Stubs, and unspent Stubs will carry forward to the full release.</p><p>However, unopened purchased packs and player items will not carry over, but will instead be converted into a currency that players can use in the game's "Loyalty Shop" at launch. Additionally, "most progress and content" that players unlock in the game during the soft launch will be wiped.</p><p>For years, MLB The Show was exclusive to Sony's PlayStation family of consoles. But that changed in 2021 when MLB The Show 21 was released on Xbox, in addition to PlayStation. The following year's game, MLB The Show 22, came to Switch in addition to the other console platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-26-announced-with-first-details/1100-6536016/" data-ref-id="1100-6536016">MLB The Show 26 is the newest entry in the series</a> and it's coming in 2026, presumably timed to release around the start of the next MLB season.</p><h2><strong>MLB The Show minimum technical specs for mobile</strong></h2><p><strong>iOS</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: A13</li><li>Minimum RAM: 3GB, Recommended RAM 4 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: iOS 26</li><li>Supported Devices:  <ul><li>iPhone SE 2nd Gen and 3rd Gen</li><li>iPhone 11 and above (iPhone 17 Pro Max)</li></ul></li><li>No iPads</li></ul><p><strong>Android</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9200 (Mali G715)</li><li>Minimum RAM: 4 GB, Recommended RAM 8 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: Android 12 Snow Cone (SDK 31)</li><li>No Tablets</li></ul>

                <p>According to one analyst, Call of Duty as a franchise is "underperforming" in 2025 due to a variety of factors. Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said in an interview that some of the factors that he believes are contributing to Call of Duty's decline include "community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition."</p><p>In terms of the competition, Elliott called out Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, along with Fortnite, which recently had a popular Simpsons season and launched its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">positively received Chapter 7.</a></p><p>"Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elliott told Eurogamer</a>. "Attention is scarce."</p><p>Elliott went on to say that players are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Call of Duty's "lack of innovation." Prior to Black Ops 7's release, Elliott said people would buy Black Ops 7 even if they complained about a lack of innovation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">because many people buy new Call of Duty games yearly as part of "autopilot" purchasing.</a> Elliott also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">predicted that Black Ops 7 would outsell Battlefield 6</a>, but he made this prediction prior to the release of both games.</p><p>Elliott also pointed out that Call of Duty's turn toward more "Fortnite-like cosmetics" and "non-military character skins" like Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj has "alienated a significant portion of the fanbase who prefer a more grounded military aesthetic."</p><p>For what it's worth, Black Ops 7 does not feature the same kind of wacky and over-the-top skins that Black Ops 6 had, in part because Activision said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/" data-ref-id="1100-6534614">heard the concerns that Call of Duty had strayed from its identity</a>. Warzone, however, still has all of those kinds of skins.</p><p>For Black Ops 7 specifically, Elliott said the game's co-op campaign was a "major point of criticism," while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">the game's use of "AI slop"</a> was a sore spot for some.</p><p>"Player reception was [also] largely negative, with a mostly negative Steam user score and review bombing galore. Long-standing player frustrations, like the perceived impact of skill-based matchmaking--and the focus on heavy microtransactions (skins and bundles) over core gameplay quality, continue to drive players away from the franchise," he added.</p><p>Additionally, Elliott said Black Ops 7 launching into Game Pass "cannibalized traditional full-price game sales" for Xbox and PC. He pointed to the reporting that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">Black Ops 6 missed out on $300 million in potential sales</a> due to the game being on Game Pass.</p><p>"Our estimates have signaled time and time again that Game Pass cannibalizes game revenues--and Call of Duty is no different," he said.</p><p>Beyond all of this, Elliott said the marketing for Black Ops 7 was "pretty abysmal and underwhelming," while the game's formal reveal event at Call of Duty Next was "messy and did little to excite the community."</p><p>"This is again in stark contrast to the community-driven, focused marketing of Battlefield and Arc, whose development and marketing has been incredibly community-driven," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">sold more than 10 million copies</a>, reportedly, but there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-reported-black-ops-7-regional-sales-numbers-are-unimpressive/1100-6536468/" data-ref-id="1100-6536468">no sales data available yet for Black Ops 7</a>. Any comparison would be incomplete and unfair, as Black Ops 7 is on Game Pass and is available on more platforms than Battlefield 6. No shooter has outsold Call of Duty in terms of full-year in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">since 2006</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">Battlefield 6 has already eclipsed the first-month sales of Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3.</a></p>
