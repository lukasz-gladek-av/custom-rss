                <p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-sends-refund-payments-consumers-impacted-epic-games-unlawful-billing-practices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The first round of refund payments</a> have arrived in the hands of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players who the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says "were tricked by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite, into making unwanted purchases." Payments have been sent to folks who filed a claim before the original February 2024 deadline--but don't worry, there's still more time to get in on this settlement if you missed out previously.</p><p>At issue, according to the FTC, was "Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." This refers to how the item shop used to allow players to make a purchase with a single, instant button push, and there was only a very brief window within which it was possible to cancel the purchase. The additions of the "hold-to-purchase" interaction in the shop, as well as the 24-hour window to cancel a purchase, were the result of this and similar suits in Europe.</p><p>As part of the claims process, users could choose to be paid via check or PayPal. Those who chose PayPal and have an approved claim--which the FTC  said makes up about half of the 629,344 payments in this round--should have received the money in their accounts on Monday. Those who opted for a check will receive it later.</p><p>This round of payments totaled about $72 million, which means users received a little over $100 on average, though the totals varied based on how much each person had spent during the window of time that this settlement applied to, with players receiving $250-300 on the high end.</p><p>For those who haven't filed a claim but want to get in on these refunds, it's still possible to do so--this first round of payments is only a third of the total Epic is supposed to pay, and the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FTC is still taking claims on its website here</a>. Just keep in mind this is only for folks who played Fortnite prior to September 2022, so newer players need not apply.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Despite releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is filled to the brim with content. From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.</p><p>However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before "beating it," that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.</p><h2>How long to beat Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly "beat it." Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.</p><p>With that in mind, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">beating Path of Exile 2</a> can be defined as simply reaching the endgame and getting past all the campaign acts. In early access, there are three acts you need to progress through before reaching the endgame. This number of acts will eventually be doubled to six in the full release of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761"></a><figcaption>Act 2 features a completely new zone and quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png"></figure><p>However, just beating the three acts doesn't get you to the endgame. Instead, you need to first beat the three acts on standard difficulty, which gets you to level 45. Then, you're required to beat Acts 1-3 again on Cruel difficulty to finally reach the endgame. Doing all of this should result in your character being around level 65.</p><p>Your first time <strong>beating the three acts should take 25 or so hours</strong> in Path of Exile 2. Then, you'll need another 15-20 hours to get past the acts again on Cruel difficulty. This puts the time to reach the endgame anywhere from 40-50 hours per character.</p><p>If you want to play as another class in Path of Exile 2, you'll have to repeat the same process over again. This means another 40-50 hours to reach the endgame with that character.</p><p>Once you reach the endgame in Path of Exile 2, the world is your oyster. You have the freedom to spend any additional amount of time with any character as you progress through endgame content. The maximum level cap in Path of Exile 2 early access is level 100, though, so it might not be worth it to try and go past that level just yet.</p><h2>Path of Exile 2 full quest list</h2><p>One of the best ways to track your progress during the main story is by checking what quest you're on. If you know the names and order of the quests in each act, you can accurately gauge how far away you are from the next act.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762"></a><figcaption>A full quest list for Act 1.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png"></figure><p>Below, you'll find the full three-act main quest list in Path of Exile 2:</p><p><strong>Act 1</strong></p><ul><li>Reaching Clearfell  <ul><li>Mercy for the Miller</li></ul></li><li>Secrets in the Dark</li><li>The Mysterious Shade</li><li>Sorrow Among Stones</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>The Mad Wolf of Ogham</li></ul><p><strong>Act 2</strong></p><ul><li>Earning Passage</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>A Theft of Ivory</li><li>The City of Seven Waters</li><li>A Crown of Stone</li></ul><p><strong>Act 3</strong></p><ul><li>Legacy of the Vaal</li><li>The Vaal Jungle</li><li>Mysteries of the Vaal</li></ul><p>There are more quests in Act 3, but that's all players have seen up to this point.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> has a three-act campaign experience in early access plus loads of endgame content to dive into. You can take part in the story as a solo character, only relying on your abilities for help, or as a part of a six-player party. Five additional players are supported to join you on your journey, but you're free to make a party of any size up to that number.</p><p>While making a party for your friends and blasting your way through Path of Exile 2 together sounds great, the logistics of getting that set up can be complicated. Allow us to explain everything you need to know about adding friends and making a party in Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>How to add friends in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Path of Exile 2 makes it easy to add friends, as all you need is their username and tag number. As we've explained in a previous guide, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-cross-play-explained/1100-6527844/" data-ref-id="1100-6527844">Path of Exile 2 is fully cross-play</a>, so you can add any friend regardless of their system.</p><p>To add a friend, simply open the Social tab (J on keyboard by default) and find the "Friends" tab. From there, just type in your friend's username and the number that follows the "#" sign after their name in the "Friend Invite" box. If you've typed in everything correctly, press "Send" and your friend will get the request in their Social tab.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412577"></a><figcaption>The Social menu in Path of Exile 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png"></figure><p>Alternatively, you can find your friend requests in the Social tab as well. You can view your requests in the "Friends" tab under the "Invitations Received" box. You'll also be able to view all of your online and offline friends from here as well.</p><p>As a note, the Social tab looks differently if you're on keyboard and mouse or controller. However, the menu acts the same way, as you still need to view the Friends tab and type in a friend's name and tag to add them.</p><p>If you're already a part of a Guild in Path of Exile 2, scroll over one tab to view the "Guild" section of the Social menu. Here, you can view your Guild and see everyone that's online. This allows you to message them privately and invite them to a party in-game. If you're not part of a Guild yet, this is also where you can join one or view your invites to a Guild.</p><h2>How to make a party in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Once you add some friends in Path of Exile 2, it's time to get all of you in a party together. To do this, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Scroll over to the "Create Party" tab from the Social menu.</li><li>Here, you'll have the option to create a party or join a party.</li><li>If you want to create a party, select that option and invite any online friends to join it. You can also make your party public and have anyone join it.</li><li>You can set certain restrictions on your party, which include opening it up to friends only or invite only.</li><li>Once someone joins the party, you'll be notified so you can all group up in the same location.</li><li>To join a party, select that option. However, this will only allow you to join Public Parties, which are parties that others have made.</li><li>To join a friend's party, click on their name in your friends list and if their party is open to friends, you can join it.</li><li>If your friend's party is set to invite only, you'll need an invite from them to join the party.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412581" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412581"></a><figcaption>Creating or making a party in the Social menu. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png"></figure><p>Everything relating to friends and parties is managed through the Social menu, so when all else fails, check there to view any requests, invites, or your friends list.</p><h2>How to play couch co-op in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Of course, going through the friends list isn't the only way to play in a party in Path of Exile 2. The game also supports couch co-op, meaning you can play with another person from the same system you're using. To play in couch co-op, you need two controllers connected to your system and you'll need to make two separate characters as well. This is not possible with two sets of keyboards and mice.</p><p>With your two controllers connected, go to the character selection screen. In the top-left, press the settings cog and go to the Input menu. Make sure your input is set to "Controller." Once that's done, go back to the character selection screen and each controller should have the ability to create or select a character. Player 1 will be on the left side of the screen and Player 2 is on the right.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412672" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412672"></a><figcaption>Connecting a second controller will let you play in couch co-op.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png"></figure><p>If you don't see the option to make a second character, you'll likely see "P2: Connect a controller" in the top-right of the screen. This means your second controller either isn't connected or isn't working.</p><p>After you get both characters up and running, you can play Path of Exile 2 as you normally would. Only now, your screen will be split into two.</p><h2>Can you disable cross-play in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>While Path of Exile 2 offers full cross-play between PS5, Xbox, and PC, some players might only want to see players from their specific system in-game.</p><p>However, there doesn't appear to be a way to fully disable cross-play. If you go through all the settings and the Social menu, you won't find an option to disable or enable the feature. It's possible the ability to turn off cross-play could arrive later in early access or at the full launch, though.</p><p>For now, if you're on Xbox Series X|S or PS5, you can disable cross-play across your entire system through the console's settings. This is done through the "Account and Network" settings of your console. PC players currently have no way to disable cross-play in Path of Exile 2.</p>

                <p>The Monk is one of the six available classes in the early access build of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>. It's a mixed melee and ranged class that has access to a few different types of builds, all of which are hugely rewarding if used properly. While the Monk seems fairly weak at the start of Path of Exile 2, it only gets stronger as the game goes on, culminating in an extremely strong endgame character.</p><p>If you want some tips on how to build your Monk or advice on what skills to use, we have everything you need in the guide below.</p><h2>Monk Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>When you first start Path of Exile 2 as a Monk, you'll have access to a constant quarterstaff melee attack, as well as some basic ranged, elemental skills. The Monk can make use of both lightning and frost damage as well as air skills that can damage and/or stun enemies. During the early game, you'll want to use any skill that's first presented to you, regardless of its damage type.</p><p>However, as you level your Monk into the teens, you can start focusing on one or two damage types to really synergize the build. This will help you establish a clear direction for your passive ability skill tree and make it easier to choose an Ascendancy for your Monk eventually.</p><p>Regardless of your level, you want to try to increase your Dexterity and Intelligence attributes as much as possible. The Monk is a mobile class that relies on dodging enemy attacks up close and from a distance. Dexterity helps keep your Monk as mobile as possible, while the Intelligence attribute ensures you have enough mana to cast all the elemental skills you can access.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412447" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412447"></a><figcaption>Dexterity and Intelligence are your main attributes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png"></figure><p>After a while, you'll likely want to ditch your basic quarterstaff melee attack to focus solely on those elemental skills. In the early game, though, those melee attacks will likely deal the most damage to enemies, so spam it whenever you get into trouble. Quarterstaff attacks also don't use any mana, which is a nice bonus in the early levels but as you progress, you'll usually have enough mana to spam other skills and still have some left over.</p><h2>Best Monk Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Now that you better understand the Monk in Path of Exile 2, it's time to go over what kind of skills you want to use. Currently, the best route for a Monk is utilizing most of the lightning skills the class can use. However, you also want to pair those lightning skills with one or two air skills.</p><p>In the early game, feel free to mix the lightning and air skills with a frost skill, since you'll have some space on your hotbar anyway. Glacial Cascade is the best frost skill that can be a highly effective boss killer for the Monk. This ranged skill creates a line of frost on the ground and explodes after reaching a certain point. Spamming this against bosses from a few meters away can deal tons of damage and also freeze the boss, opening them up to additional attacks.</p><p>We won't be using Glacial Cascade in our final build, though, as that's full of lightning and air skills that punish enemies up close and from far away. Here are the skills we recommend for a Monk in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Falling Thunder</li><li>Killing Palm</li><li>Staggering Palm</li><li>Tempest Bell</li><li>Tempest Flurry</li><li>Whirling Assault</li><li>Gathering Storm</li><li>Flicker Strike</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412442" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412442"></a><figcaption>The skills for a Monk range in elemental damage and type of attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png"></figure><p>Your build truly starts when you reach level 12 and can unlock the Tempest Flurry skill. This can essentially replace your basic quarterstaff attack, as it's a combo melee skill that inflicts lightning damage. After a full combo, the skill ends with a thunderous, AoE lightning strike.</p><p>You can use Tempest Flurry in concert with the Tempest Bell, which relies on you getting a four-hit melee combo. Once that combo is hit, you can throw down a large bell, dealing damage each time you strike it with an attack. The bell deals air damage by default but if you hit it with a lightning attack, it will deal the same type of damage.</p><p>Placing down the Tempest Bell and standing still to hit it will require a full shield/HP bar, though, as enemies will continue to hit you. If there are too many enemies around, using the Falling Thunder skill to clear out large groups is an effective strategy. Falling Thunder relies on the power charge system however, which gives you stronger attacks when fully built up. When enemies are at low health from your attacks, finish them off with Killing or Staggering Palm.</p><p>At the later levels, you unlock skills like Whirling Assault, Gathering Storm, and Flicker Strike. Flicker Strike, in particular, is a useful addition, as it allows you to jump from enemy to enemy dealing damage. This gives the Monk extra mobility to stay out of harm's way. If you just want to clear out hordes of enemies, though, Whirling Assault is your best bet.</p><h2>Best Monk Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>With the basic skills out of the way, you can now equip those skills with the right Support Gems. You'll also start to receive Spirit Gems, which can be used to equip your Monk with extra buffs.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Perpetual Charge (Falling Thunder)</li><li>Lightning Infusion (Falling Thunder)</li><li>Ruthless (Tempest Bell)</li><li>Magnified Effect (Tempest Bell)</li><li>Life Drain (Killing Palm)</li><li>Profusion (Killing Palm)</li><li>Overpower (quarterstaff attack)</li><li>Conduction (Tempest Flurry)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412443"></a><figcaption>Support Gems can help your Monk's skills perform better.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png"></figure><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Herald of Thunder</li><li>Lingering Illusion</li></ul><p>In general, you want to stick with the Dexterity Support Gems when looking to kit out your Monk. There are plenty of solid options for all your skills that increase elemental damage, improve potential charges, and give you more area of effect.</p><h2>Best Monk Passive Skills</h2><p>Every time you level up with the Monk, you'll receive points to put into the Passive Ability skill tree. For the most part, you'll want to stick with nodes that deal with lightning damage, but there are some specific nodes you should grab as soon as possible:</p><ul><li>Conservative Casting</li><li>Killer Instinct</li><li>Flow Like Water</li><li>Step Like Mist</li><li>Essence of the Storm</li><li>Immortal Infamy</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412444" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412444"></a><figcaption>Passive Abilities help your Monk in a variety of ways.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png"></figure><h2>Best Monk Ascendancy</h2><p>Finally, after leveling your Monk enough, you'll have to pick an Ascendancy. As with all classes in early access, only two Ascendancies are available for the Monk in Path of Exile 2: The Invoker and the Acolyte of Chayula.</p><p>For our build, only The Invoker makes sense. This Ascendancy promotes the use of elemental attacks and buildup, meaning you'll deal more damage with your lightning attacks and have a higher chance to shock enemies. Specifically, The Invoker has a passive ability called "I am Thunder" that grants you extra lightning damage and the ability to shock the ground around you.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players have discovered a match-ending nuke Easter egg on one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>'s multiplayer maps. This is a secret nuke that doesn't require an impressive 25-killstreak to unlock, but it still won't be a cakewalk to pull off. Don't worry about nukes ruining all your matches either, as this Easter egg is seemingly only available in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Warhead multiplayer map is designed to be a test site similar to the fan-favorite Nuketown map, but this variant shows the buildings and cars of Nuketown dumped in the Nevada desert and filled with sand. The map also contains a giant warhead that can be used for cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, players have discovered that if they dump enough bullets into the warhead, it will explode and end the match. As shown in the video clip shared by "<a href="https://x.com/M3RKMUS1C/status/1865495113377403358" rel="nofollow ">M3RKMUS1C</a>," the warhead takes tons of ammo to detonate. Additionally, detonating the nuke results in a match loss for all players.</p><p dir="ltr">Those loading into a private match to try this out with friends will want to make sure they build a class with enough ammo. Using the Overkill Wildcard should help, and picking weapons with high-ammo counts like light machine guns is also a smart choice.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for the best weapon loadouts to use in Call of Duty, we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/">recommended weapon builds for multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-warzone-best-weapon-loadouts-for-bo6-season-1/2900-5959/">Warzone</a>.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded recently added new multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/bo6-zombies-how-to-complete-the-story-easter-egg-for-citadelle-des-morts/2900-6047/">Citadelle des Morts map for Zombies</a>.</p>
