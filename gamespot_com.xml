                <p>Stray Kite Studios--an indie developer that includes veterans from BioShock, Borderlands, and Age of Empires--has debuted the first look at the company's inaugural original title Wartorn. As seen in the trailer below, the game thrusts players into the lives of two elven sisters who are trying to survive long enough to reunite with their family. And they'll have to make some tough decisions along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tt1bNPFk0U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Combat will play a major role in their journey, but it won't be the only thing that impacts their fate. Stray Kite indicated that the sisters will "confront moral dilemmas and battle external and internal threats." Luckily, they aren't powerless in this fantasy world.</p><p>"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Stary Kite Studios creative director Paul Hellquist said in a statement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains, but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."</p><p>The studio also touted the destructible environments as well as the dynamic combat system that puts the elements of water, fire, and electricity in the hands of the players. Wartorn's roguelike progression system will offer upgrades, items, and new abilities that will carry over to each run. Players can also slow down time to keep their characters from being overwhelmed in the heat of battle.</p><p>Prior to this game, Stray Kite Studios worked with Gearbox and 2K Tiny Tinaâ€™s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. The studio has also created minigames through Fortnite Creative.</p><p>Wartorn will be available in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Epic Game Store in Spring 2025.</p>
