                <p dir="ltr">The final expansion of Alan Wake 2, The Lake House, is out now, closing a chapter for Remedy that was 13 years in the making. In The Lake House, players assume the role of Agent Kiran Estevez as she investigates the titular Federal Bureau of Control satellite station following a disturbance. The high strangeness of Remedy's Control mixes with the horror of Alan Wake 2, giving the expansion the feeling of both an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-expansion-is-both-an-epilogue-and-prologue/1100-6527270/">epilogue and a prologue</a>, as the studio continues to build out its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/">connected universe, the RCU</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently caught up with the DLC's star, Janina Gavankar, whom you may know from things like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and True Blood. Gavankar explained what she loves about working with Remedy, why she's hoping to do it again soon, and whether we can expect to see her in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control-2/" data-ref-id="5000-575910">Control's sequel</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been stalking Remedy and Sam [Lake] for eight years," Gavankar said. "Quantum Break was my first Remedy game, and I loved it so much. I found all three acts of [in-universe movie script] Time Knife, and I invited some of the cast over, and I made a soundboard so I could play effects, and I streamed a live reading of it. I think that's when Sam and other people at Remedy realized, 'Oh, <em>she's like us</em>.'"</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, it seems like many collaborators have become lifelong friends of the studio. Quantum Break's Shawn Ashmore, for example, is always rooting for the studio online. Why is it that Remedy creates these bonds with so many who come into the company's orbit? "Everybody goes into Remedy and comes out even more invested than when they started. You're seeing that over and over," she told me."I'm lucky to call Sam a close friend now. He's just as wonderful as he is weird [...] At this point, I have starred in major releases. I have been consulting at both independent and triple-A studios for over half a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">"And every organism is different. You, as a reporter, know that; you can feel that. You've talked to them all, and I've worked for them all," Gavankar continued. "So, when you come upon a company like Remedy, that has a maestro, you can feel it. The lucky thing, in this case, is that the maestro is a good person and still so enthusiastic and energetic about working with artists--he's not a star f***er. I've been around those guys, too, and they're talented, sure, but you can tell the difference between somebody who is chasing Hollywood and someone who's really an auteur in the medium that matters the most, which, to me, is games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391893"></a><figcaption>It seems likely we haven't seen the last of Agent Estevez in Remedy's expansive story universe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given Agent Estevez is an FBC agent, she seems well-suited to be in the previously announced Control sequel. On top of that, Remedy clearly enjoys working with the same collaborators repeatedly, with actors such as Matthew Poretta, Shawn Ashmore, Courtney Hope, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/max-payne-voice-actor-james-mccaffrey-the-heart-of-remedy-games-dies-at-65/1100-6520015/">late, great James McCaffrey</a> all having worked on multiple Remedy games, sometimes spanning several decades. It sure does seem like we could see Estevez again. Gavankar couldn't confirm my theory, but she liked the idea very much.</p><p dir="ltr">"Please say all of that to Sam. Did you talk to him yet? Please tell him all of that," she joked. "Tell him how perfectly seamlessly she fits into everything. I agree."</p><p dir="ltr">With her character mixed up in the RCU, I asked Gavankar how much she tries to make sense of it all or whether she focuses merely on Estevez's role and leaves the theory-crafting for others. "Oh, it all makes sense to me. But also, as a writer, I write high strangeness as well. So we get along very well, me and Remedy. I don't flinch at any of these things," she told me, echoing a Stephen King quote heard in the opening moments of 2010's Alan Wake vouching for the "unexplained mystery."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an artist, you don't want to explain everything away--like those Ending Explained videos, I hate them because [they take] away any agency from the audience members. It's okay to believe that your audience is smart enough to figure it out for themselves. Also, it might fit somewhere in their human experience in a way that you didn't intend, and that is so much more important than explaining what your point was."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2's The Lake House expansion is out now and marks the last story update for the game. Along with the previous expansion, Night Springs, it's included in the Deluxe Edition, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/">finally available as a physical release</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though a sequel to Control is in development, the next game from Remedy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a three-player co-op PvE game set in the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>

                <p>Grinding Gear Games has announced that Path of Exile 2's early access launch has been delayed from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-launches-in-early-access-this-november/1100-6525988/" data-ref-id="1100-6525988">November 15</a> to December 6. This is due to server-side infrastructure work that's taking longer than anticipated.</p><p>According to game director Jonathan Rogers, the studio intends to keep its promises of allowing microtransactions from the first game to carry to the second game. Not only do new systems have to be built, but the developers also have to make sure that old data from the first game is backwards compatible with them as well. The developers also have to conduct load testing to make sure that the game doesn't fall apart at launch.</p>

<p>Rogers also explained that he believes the original launch date could have been met, but not without making mistakes. "We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for, and nobody has their account broken," he said in a video.</p><p>There will be a livestream in about four weeks to show what players can expect during the early access period. Path of Exile 2 is a top-down action role-playing game where players can choose between 12 different character classes. The storyline will have six acts, and endgame content includes more than 100 maps with their own boss fights and modifiers.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While it was originally supposed to be an expansion of the first game, Path of Exile 2 will have new features such as local couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression.</p>

One thing that Mass Effect fans can expect to see kept intact is the realistic art direction of that series, as opposed to the stylized visual approach of the new Dragon Age game.</p><p>"Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamble wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter) in response to a comment about Dragon Age's art direction. In terms of mood, Gamble added that "Mass Effect will maintain the mature tone" of the original trilogy of games, <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1851104266494366167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with some room for its serious characters</a> to be put into humorous situations.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1851091873584308332" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Regarding tone questions: Mass Effect will maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy. This is all I'm gonna say for now.</p>  — Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1851091873584308332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Mass Effect games have traditionally aimed for a photorealistic presentation using the technology of the time, and while there have been some technical gaffes--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-mass-effect-andromeda-patch-goes-live-promis/1100-6449220/" data-ref-id="1100-6449220">Mass Effect: Andromeda's infamous issues</a>--each entry in the series has looked great in action.</p><p>The characters have generally been rendered with realistic proportions, leaving BioWare room to put a creative stamp on the technology and fashion of a franchise that is set in the distant future of humanity. BioWare producer Brenon Holmes previously confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mass-effect-runs-on-unreal-engine-5-it-appears/1100-6499132/" data-ref-id="1100-6499132">Mass Effect 5 will utilize Unreal Engine 5</a>, which is capable of producing convincingly realistic graphics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-featuring-captain-america-and-black-panther/1100-6521993/" data-ref-id="1100-6521993">like in the upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra game</a>.</p><p>While it'll still be a while before Mass Effect 5 launches, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5s-development-team-is-made-up-of-veterans-bioware-reminds-fans/1100-6522139/">the game does feature several series veterans working on it</a>. Gamble previously noted that Mass Effect 5's executive producer, art director, creative director, and game director are all veterans of the original Mass Effect trilogy.</p><p>November 7 marks the next N7 Day, an unofficial holiday of sorts celebrating the series. BioWare has frequently used the day to reveal news and teases, and while nothing is confirmed yet, it could be when we get our next official glimpse of the upcoming Mass Effect sequel.</p>
