                <p>As of November 18, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew is now an included benefit with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</a></li><li><a href="#What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_">What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs </a></li><li><a href="#Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. </p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_"><span>What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate <em>just </em>for Crew.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official FAQs</a> do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.</p>

                <p>A game industry legend, Rebecca Heineman, has passed away due to cancer on November 17, 2025. She was 62 years old. Friends of Heineman have mourned her across <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media.</a></p><p>Heineman had a prolific career in the game industry that included both game design and high-level competitive play. She won multiple Atari 2600 Space Invaders tournament, including the Atari VCS Space Invaders National Championship held in New York. She became the first national video game tournament champion in the United States.</p><p>"I had two strategies. One was "slow and steady", which won the L.A. tournament, and the other was "kill everything on the screen ASAP," which won me the NYC finals," she said in a 2006 <a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/rebecca_heineman/interview_rebecca_heineman.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "In the finals, I took an hour and 45 minutes to get the highest score. I lost one or two bases because my strategy was riskier, but faster. It paid off and I won."</p><p>Heineman was a founder or co-founder of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül. She worked on hundreds of games, including classics like Dragon Wars and The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate. She also wrote for Electronic Games and worked with major publishers and studios like EA and Sony. Her work touched several major parts of the gaming world.</p><p>Heineman witnessed several changes throughout her time in the game industry, including major innovations in gaming visuals. She recalled how games had become similar to movies, complete with voice actors and scripts. Her approach to game design remained steady, though.</p><p>"The easiest for me is coming up with how to implement a game," she said in 2006. "I always envision in my head what the game should look like on the screen before a line of code is written. Then I design the code to work with that. It allows me to get the game up and running in a very short period of time."</p><p>For more on Rebecca Heineman’s early gaming accomplishments, she was featured in a segment of the Netflix gaming documentary <em>High Score</em>. A GoFundMe is currently underway to assist with funeral arrangements.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Yoko Taro has found success with the Drakengard and Nier franchise(s), but he hasn't had a new game since the Voice of Cards trilogy several years ago. However, the creator of the NieR games insists that he's remained busy in that time, but his games keep getting canceled.</p><p>According to a report on <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Yoko addressed the issue while appearing on a panel at the G-CON 2025 video game convention in Korea. He told the audience that his most recent projects fell apart during development.</p><p>"I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren’t you making a new sequel to Nier' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," said Yoko. "I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released."</p><p>Yoko didn't explain why his projects were canceled or offer any additional details about what they were. He did note that he'd rather see games get canceled than release something that fails to live up to the standards he set with his previous games.</p><p>In 2023, Yoko facetiously said the next Nier game could come out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-says-new-nier-could-come-tomorrow-or-35-years-from-now/1100-6510815/" data-ref-id="1100-6510815">tomorrow or 35 years from now</a>. Nier Reincarnation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-reincarnation-is-shutting-down-but-more-content-is-coming-first/1100-6520531/" data-ref-id="1100-6520531">was shut down in 2024</a>, but Yoko released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nier-tie-in-books-written-by-yoko-taro-releasing-this-month/1100-6521653/" data-ref-id="1100-6521653">two Nier tie-in books</a> that year. Last year, Hiroyuki Kobayashi implied that he's collaborating with Yoko and composer Keiichi Okabe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-is-working-on-new-game-with-nier-producer-and-composer/1100-6523481/" data-ref-id="1100-6523481">on a new project</a>. Earlier in 2025, Yoko shared his prediction that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">AI will put human game developers out of work</a> in 50 years.</p>

                <p>Developer Embark Studios is currently riding high on the success of Arc Raiders, and the studio has now <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that its last game, 2023's The Finals, is shutting down on one specific platform.</p><p>The Finals will close on PS4 when Season 10 starts on March 18, 2026. This is being done so Embark can focus on current-generation hardware, the studio said, and anyone who wants to keep playing on PS4 will have to migrate to a different, newer console platform, or PC.</p><p>All progress and purchases are connected to Embark ID accounts and will thus transfer to whatever platform people may migrate to. "We're incredibly grateful to everyone who's been part of the PS4 community. See you in the Arena!" the developer said.</p><p>The Finals was never released on Xbox One, so the migration to current-generation platforms doesn't pertain to Xbox. The game is currently available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC, as well as PS4 until March 16.</p><p>The PS4 edition of The Finals launched in December 2024, about a year after the game originally came out for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in December 2023.</p><p>Arc Raiders has sold more than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1oun46w/arc_raiders_is_officially_a_hit_with_over_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4 million copies</a> and remains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's No. 1 best-selling game</a> and one of the platform's most-played games overall.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>
