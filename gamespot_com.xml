                <p>The return of Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, Verdansk, appears to be doing its job of driving players back to the game, on Steam at least. On Steam, Warzone and Black Ops 6 are packaged together inside the overarching "Call of Duty" launcher--and player numbers are spiking.</p><p>Call of Duty <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surged past 114,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam today, April 3, following the re-introduction of Verdansk to Warzone for the first time since December 2021. This is the <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1907864893702733843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highest player count for Call of Duty in 2025 so far</a>. It's still well below the all-time peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">491,670 players</a> from November 2022, however. At 114,000+ concurrent players, Call of Duty is the No. 8 most popular game on Steam at press time.</p><p>Warzone itself is a free-to-play game, but it's not listed as such on Steam because it's part of the Call of Duty launcher that includes paid titles like Black Ops 6. It's not clear how many of the 110,000+ people playing Call of Duty on Steam are playing Warzone. Also unknown is how Warzone is performing on Xbox and PlayStation since the reintroduction of Verdansk.</p><p>Beyond the return of Verdansk, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/" data-ref-id="2900-6387">Black Ops 6's new Season 3 update</a> is live now with lots of new content, including more weapons, maps, and modes.</p><p>Call of Duty seems to be banking on nostalgia to revive Warzone's player count. A recent report said if the arrival of Verdansk fails to retain existing players and/or bring back lapsed players, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">there will be no "Warzone 3."</a> (For what it's worth, the current version of Warzone is a renamed version of Warzone 2.0). It's not clear what this means, though, or how Activision may measure success.</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall. For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">Black Ops 6 was 2024's best-selling game in the US. </a></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> this week for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo showed off even more gameplay footage during a Treehouse Live event, and more information about the game has come to light.</p><p>Social media user BearUNLV clipped a segment from the broadcast that shows the Mario Kart World character-select screen. There are three rows of four characters on one page for a total of 12, with seven tabs shown at the bottom of the screen. If each tab has 12 characters, this suggests there are a whopping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">84 characters in Mario Kart World</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7488860529600285998?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8vEQLcI9xSV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subsequent video from IGN runs through</a> the characters and costumes, featuring 60 in all, including costume variants like Gondolier Luigi and Yakuta Peach. The IGN video features five tabs as opposed to seven tabs in the official Nintendo video.</p><p>For comparison, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Switch had 36 characters, including those featured in the base game and through DLC. It hasn't been explicitly confirmed as of yet if Mario Kart World does indeed have 84 characters; since we haven't seen the full roster, it's unknown. But Mario Kart World appears to be aiming to be a bigger Mario Kart game overall, so a larger character roster wouldn't be a surprise.</p><p>The new Mario Kart World video also suggests the game will have at least 28 tracks spread across seven Cups, along with 24 vehicles. Interestingly, it looks like Mario Kart World has fully formed vehicles; players seemingly no longer select individual parts to assemble a car.</p><p>One major lingering question that remains unanswered for Mario Kart World is if the game will have DLC characters and courses like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe did.</p><p>Another video from the event showed the stage DK Spaceport, which includes a segment at the end that recreates the classic 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong. As you can see in the video below, racers have to dodge barrels that a giant DK is tossing down at them right at the race's finish. With up to 24 players competing at a time--the most ever for the Mario Kart series--things may get pretty chaotic.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">At the end of the DK Spaceport stage in Mario Kart World, they've recreated the arcade classic. <br>A very cool ending to a track, especially when you have that many racers at once trying to dodge barrels. <a href="https://t.co/WSf0z52RO4" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WSf0z52RO4</a></p>  — Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Mario Kart World appears to be a larger-scale Mario Kart game with a price tag to follow--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">it will cost $80</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">He said he thought the idea of having to pause the game and go to the home screen, find the right menu, make a chat room, and then return to the game (the way basically every other modern video game console does it) was "bothersome." That resulted in the idea of the C button.</p><p dir="ltr">"So we asked for a special button to be added while the hardware design was in progress," Ono said. "It was a very last-minute request, just before the controller molds were about to be made."</p><p dir="ltr">Ono said he thinks GameChat's ease of use, as well as the fact that the Switch 2 comes with a built-in microphone, will result in more players trying voice chat for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew a lot of players would eventually stop using this feature if it wasn't easy to understand, so we worked hard to ensure it could be used easily to play with friends and family without any fuss," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the interview, Ono described GameChat as one of the Switch 2's "defining features," and that its origins came from trying to capture the vibe of a "student lounge" where people can gather not just to play games but also hang out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until now, online play for Nintendo games has meant everyone coming together to play the same game," Ono said. "But more than anything, we wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">GameChat will technically require a Nintendo Online subscription to use, but can be accessed for free until March 2026, around nine months after the Switch 2 releases in June 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">In a previous developer interview, Nintendo said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-could-have-had-magnetic-joy-cons-like-switch-2/1100-6530577/" data-ref-id="1100-6530577">Switch 2's magnetic Joy-Con 2's were originally an idea for the first Switch</a>, but the idea was shelved following a meeting with late Nintendo President Satoru Iwata where he gave feedback on the prototype.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $450</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders, including a Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World, going live April 9</a>. Nintendo announced a number of new first-party games coming exclusively to Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bonanza</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-upgrades-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-revealed/1100-6530550/" data-ref-id="1100-6530550">Switch 2 versions of games like Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
