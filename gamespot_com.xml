                <p>Microsoft has announced a "strategic, multiyear" partnership with AMD to power its next-generation devices, including the next Xbox home console.</p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond made the announcement today. She said Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room<em> and </em>in your hands."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Working with AMD, Bond said Microsoft will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" and "enhanced" with the power of AI.</p><p>Microsoft's vision is to create a platform that allows games to be "always with you" across devices. No longer will games to "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, Bond said, adding that the Xbox and Windows teams will work closely to achieve this.</p><p>In February 2024, Bond said the next Xbox would offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> </p><p>As for Microsoft's handheld ambitions, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-essentially-canceled-report/1100-6532402/" data-ref-id="1100-6532402">company's plans for its own Xbox handheld device are potentially on hold or canceled. </a>However, the company is working with Asus on multiple Xbox ROG Ally devices that are set to launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>

                <p>Remember the creepy children's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMfHjN8CZE&amp;ab_channel=CaptainSpandexPlays" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppet show</a> from Control? FBC: Firebreak's launch trailer isn't nearly as creepy, but it's continuing the puppet show idea that Control started, at least.</p><p>Remedy's launch trailer for their first multiplayer game doesn't feature gameplay of any type. Instead, it leans into the narrative element of the entire Remedy universe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u_umhMcILI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="15">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3u_umhMcILI?start=15" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We're less than a day into FBC: Firebreak's lifespan and the three-player cooperative shooter already has a mostly negative rating from players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. Many reviews have less than an hour of playtime, meaning they either didn't spend much time in the game, they bounced off of the gameplay quickly, or some combination of both. Other reviews give positive feedback while calling other reviews disingenuous. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">FBC: Firebreak preview</a>, Mark Delaney called the FPS "a defiant, punk rock take on co-op shooters."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak is the first multiplayer game from the studio behind Control and Alan Wake. It features teams of three--each person has their own distinct kit--taking on hordes of enemies while trying to accomplish a variety of objectives. There are three jobs available at launch, each with a number of difficulty settings that expand the length of the job and number of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001" data-ratio="0.56884057971014" data-width="828" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001"></a><figcaption>FBC: Firebreak post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg"></figure><p>Many reviews cite a lack of content as a reason for their disappointment. Remedy has detailed two future updates, including additional jobs and maps that will come to the game this Fall and Winter. Fans looking for more from FBC: Firebreak could check back in after those updates are released.</p>
