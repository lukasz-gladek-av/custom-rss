                <p>8BitDo has released some great keyboards, but so far, they've all been tenkeyless (TKL) models that don't include a traditional numpad (although these are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Supports-Calculator-Bluetooth-Gaming-Console/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold separately as add-ons</a>). However, that's about to change as 8BitDo is finally launching full-size models of its Retro Keyboards based on its popular<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow "> NES</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXDH8BG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Famicom</a>-inspired designs. Priced at $120 each, they'll be available starting December 12.</p><div title="6527630 - 8BitDo Full-Size Retro Keyboards Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2803" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527630 - 8BitDo Full-Size Retro Keyboards Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">8BitDo Full-Size Retro Mechanical Keyboards</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$120 | Release December 12</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>While the design is inspired by console classics, the hardware itself is pretty modern. With these keyboards, you're getting a 108-key layout, V2 Kailh Box white switches, dye-sub PBT keycaps, hot-swappable PCB for easy key switch replacement, and support for N-key rollover. Like other 8BitDo products, these keyboards can also be heavily customized using the company's in-house Ultimate Software program, or if you're in a hurry, fast-mapping on programmable buttons won't require booting up the 8BitDo client.</p>                      </div><p>These also support wireless connections via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth as well as wired via USB-C, and the included Super Buttons are a pair of big microswitch keys that can be customized to serve a wide selection of functions. The form factor on these keyboards are also very ergonomic, as the contoured design makes them feel great to work on. If they're anything like the smaller models, these will work great on not only Windows and Android devices, but also wirelessly on iOS, Mac, and Steam Deck.</p><hr><h2>More 8BitDo Keyboard Deals</h2><p>Alternatively, you can grab the current TKL models as well, as these are available in a wider selection of retro-inspired designs.

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced what's next for Grand Theft Auto Online, and November's updates to the multiplayer game is all about what some believe be the game's best and most exciting feature: <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Heists_in_GTA_Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heists</a>.</p><p>Every week in November will focus on a different GTA Online Heist. This kicks off this week with the Cayo Perico Heist, with more to come throughout the month.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, GTA Online's heists call on players to take part in multi-mission campaigns with the aim of committing a high-profile crime with a lucrative payout.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_The_Cayo_Perico_Heist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cayo Perico heist</a>, which was first released in 2020, has players trekking to the private island of Cayo Perico, fighting against armed guards, and getting away with all the money you can find. Players can take on heists solo or with friends, and coordinating with teammates makes it pretty thrilling.</p><p>November also brings a new Community Challenge, and this one is all about heists, naturally. Rockstar is calling on players to collectively steal $20 trillion worth of in-game cash between now and December 4, and if successful, Rockstar will give out "a vault full of rewards" to players.</p><p>Players who successfully complete the Cayo Perico heist between now and November 13 will earn the Panther Statue, with other rewards to be revealed later for completing more heists in November.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180" data-ratio="0.561850802644" data-width="1059" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180"></a><figcaption>The Panther Statue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png"></figure><p>For more, be sure to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kk3243ka35572/break-into-the-heist-challenge-all-month-long" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Rockstar's full blog post</a> to get up to speed on everything new in GTA Online this week and beyond.

Unlike other animals, they are easily spooked by your presence and will run away if they see you coming too aggressively. As such, this can make taming a cat a tricky endeavor. However, as long as you follow the steps below, you'll have a tamed cat in no time:</p><ul><li>First, you need to find a cat, which most commonly spawn in villages. Once you find a cat, approach them extremely carefully. Any sudden movements and the cat will run away. You also want to ensure you're crouching.</li><li>While you're approaching the cat slowly, have a raw cod or raw salmon in your hand. This makes the cat less likely to run away.</li><li>After you're close enough to the cat, feed the raw cod or salmon to it. This will successfully tame the cat, making them follow you around.</li><li>You can feed the cat another raw cod or raw salmon to make them enter love mode. If the cat is near another tamed cat, they will breed.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259"></a><figcaption>Taming two cats in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png"></figure><p>The hardest part about taming a cat is getting close enough to them to feed them the raw fish.

The process is similar to the breeding of frogs, but turtles can take much longer to lay their eggs.</p><ul><li>To breed turtles, find a beach during the day. You can usually find turtles swimming near the coast.</li><li>When you find two turtles, feed each of them some seagrass.

You'll know the turtle has found their spot when they start rotating 360 degrees.</li><li>After a while, the turtle will lay anywhere from one to four eggs.</li><li>Turtle eggs take four to five in-game days to hatch in Minecraft.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264"></a><figcaption>A turtle with its eggs in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png"></figure><p>The turtle breeding process will take some time, but after it's all said and done, you'll be left with one to four baby turtles.</p><h2 id="How_to_tame_a_Parrot_in_Minecraft">How to tame a Parrot in Minecraft</h2><p>Parrots are rare animals to find in Minecraft, but luckily, they can be tamed rather easily. This means once you find one parrot, you won't be able to get rid of them after the taming process is complete.</p><ul><li>Parrots most commonly spawn in jungle biomes. Once you find one, you can tame them by feeding them any of the following seeds:  <ul><li>Wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds.</li></ul></li><li>This doesn't guarantee you tame the parrot, however.

They can spawn all over the map in different biomes and are quite useful since they produce wool. Wool is mainly used in the creation of beds, which you'll need if you want to breed plenty of Villagers. To see how to breed sheep for more wool, read the steps below:</p><ul><li>Find two untamed adult sheep and get them close to each other.</li><li>Feed both of them wheat and they will enter love mode.</li><li>After a brief moment, the sheep will breed a baby.
