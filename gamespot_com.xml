                <p>EA's skateboarding series, Skate, has been dormant since 2010's Skate 3, but it's officially back today with the launch of a reboot that's simply titled Skate. You don't have to pay a penny to get it, as it's a free game available for everyone on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The version of the game launching today is an unfinished, early-access edition of the game. As such, players may encounter bugs or other oddities. Additionally, developer Full Circle plans to add new game modes, tricks, leaderboards, party voice chat, and other improvements over time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeGXanmlJ_0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DeGXanmlJ_0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Skate games were paid releases, but the new Skate is a free-to-play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">always-online</a> game, with EA making money off the game through the sale of microtransactions.</p><p>The original Skate came out in 2007, with sequels Skate 2 and Skate 3 arriving in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A mobile game, Skate It, launched in 2008. The franchise went dormant for more than a decade before EA announce a new Skate, simply called Skate, in 2020.</p><p>The game takes place in the fictional world of San Vansterdamn, which itself is made up of four unique neighborhoods. Full Circle said the world is "ever-evolving" and that players can expert new areas, challenges, and music to be added throughout early access.</p><p>While the Skate series has been gone for some time before it came back today, Activision's Tony Hawk series has seen multiple successful releases, including Pro Skater 1+2 and then 3+4 more recently. Outside of Tony Hawk and Skate, the play-as-a-bird skateboarding game SkateBird came out in 2021, followed by the skater sim Session in 2022.</p>

                <p>Tuesday was supposed to mark the arrival of the Power Rangers Megazord in Fortnite, both in the form of a battle pass skin and as an in-game event in which one player in each round of Battle Royale gets to become the full-sized Megazord and terrorize the island for a few minutes. The patch was delayed, but you'll be forgiven for not knowing that since Epic hasn't yet added any in-game notification about the delay. So the Megazord page of the battle pass just looks bugged right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972"></a><figcaption>The Megazord's arrival on the Fortnite island has been pushed back a couple days.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg"></figure><p>Epic has not acknowledged the delay, nor has it said when the patch will now be deployed, but a <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1966861908935581979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked trailer</a> for the Megazord in-game event says it begins on Thursday, September 18, so that's our best guess for now. As has been the case the past few seasons, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass owners</a> will be able to unlock the Megazord skin and all its related cosmetics by gaining 24 levels in any Fortnite mode. Despite the Megazord page of the pass already being unlocked, you cannot gain these levels early since the quests haven't yet been activated.</p><p>We don't know why it was delayed, but the patch appears to be a pretty beefy one, as it's expected to include the new <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1967953665878093948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Party Crashers battle royale mode</a>, which will have proximity voice chat and support teaming with opponents, Hunger Games-style.</p><p>Beyond that, this week marks the start of a new season of Rocket League, and so this Fortnite patch should add the Pontiac Firebird and Chevy Astro van from Rocket Pass 20, as well as a pile of other new vehicle cosmetics.</p>
