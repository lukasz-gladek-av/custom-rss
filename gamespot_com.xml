                <p>This week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> update, the game's first in a month, brought with it a major goodie for a lot of the folks who play on a PlayStation console: a new PlayStation Plus-exclusive skin. The new Emerald Gamer pack is included at no extra cost with any level of PS Plus membership, and can be claimed in the PlayStation Store on PS4 and PS5, in the PS App, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01922_00-PSCP300000000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the web</a>. In order to unlock the skin in-game, you will need to actually load up Fortnite on a PlayStation device at least once after claiming it from the store. Once you've done so, the skin will be usable on any platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112"></a><figcaption>All PS+ members can claim the Emerald Gamer pack now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg"></figure><p>This new pack includes the brand-new <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18187" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sage</a> skin, as well as a matching back bling and pickaxe. While most PS Plus skins have been redone versions of existing skins, like how the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=16683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shinji</a> skin in the previous PS Plus pack was a new variation of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=588" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Master Key</a> from the Chapter 1 Season 8 battle pass, Sage is actually an original character design. The Emerald Gamer pack will remain in the PlayStation Store until September 23.</p><p>The Emerald Gamer pack is the 30th PlayStation Plus pack for Fortnite thus far, and none of the items included in any of the previous packs have ever been sold in the item shop, so these items are generally considered to be exclusive despite not explicitly being stated as such.</p><p>Sage is not the only "free" skin currently available in Fortnite. Players who link a Lego account with their Epic account before August 31 will receive a free <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=17907" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">First Order Stormtrooper</a> from Star Wars, and anyone who redeems a Fortnite or Epic Games Store gift card before the end of 2026 (yes, 2026) will receive the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=17794" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghost Monks</a> skin as an added bonus.</p>

                <p>Since its foundation nearly 40 years ago, Ubisoft has been a family company, with the Guillemot brothers steering the French gaming giant. That tradition is continuing with the new spun-off subsidiary of the company funded in part by Tencent, with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's own son, Charlie Guillemot, being named as the co-CEO along with Ubisoft Montreal veteran Christophe Derennes.</p><p>The two men will lead the new subsidiary that aims to "accelerate the growth" of Ubisoft's main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p><p>Charlie Guillemot got his start in gaming at Owlient in 2014, and Ubisoft later acquired the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/our-brands/howrse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horse simulation game developer</a>. He left Ubisoft in 2021 before rejoining the company earlier this year leading up to his promotion to co-CEO. As for Derennes, he was a co-founder of Ubisoft Montreal in 1997 and was most recently the managing director for Ubisoft's North American operations.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asked by Variety</a> about concerns over nepotism, Charlie Guillemot said he "completely" understands why some would take issue with his promotion. "Yes, I'm Yves' son. That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment," he said.</p><p>Charlie will be in charge of things like the "vision, direction, content development, and marketing" of Ubisoft's main franchises going forward, while Derennes will oversee production, co-development, and technology.</p><p>Looking ahead, Charlie <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he expects generative AI and cloud technologies to "revolutionize" game development and player experiences. "Sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p><p>His comment about generative AI is likely to cause a stir given ongoing serious concerns expressed by developers about the role of generative AI in game development and potential job losses. A report from earlier this year said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide use AI</a>, despite concerns from workers. Just this week, laid-off developers at Microsoft's Candy Crush developer said <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI tools they helped create are essentially replacing them</a>. Ubisoft has been a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">big believer in generative AI for years already</a>.</p><p>Derennes, meanwhile, said video game franchises are no longer "just" games, but instead are entire "universes" and are "integral parts of the pop culture."</p><p>In the Variety interview, Derennes said the Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Rainbow Six franchises have become "full-fledged universes, and we want to expand their reach, cultural impact, and relevance with new audiences even further."</p><p>The announcement of Charlie Guillemot and Derennes as the new co-CEOs is the first phase of an ongoing rollout of announcements for the new subsidiary. "Together with Charlie, we will be working on building the leadership team of this new structure, defining roles and governance. Change is ongoing and it is very much a collective effort. While we're happy to be able to share this milestone today, we still have some work ahead of us before the new organization is operational," Derennes said.</p><p>In March, Ubisoft announced this new "dedicated subsidiary" that is focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, with Tencent providing more than $1 billion to acquire a stake. Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>

                <p>Making predictions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is a bit tricky considering that the game is still at least 10 months away. It's not a question about whether GTA 6 will be a hit, hit, but how big and how far the impact will be felt. Video game venture capitalist firm Konvoy recently released its projections for GTA 6, and it's predicting that Rockstar Games' latest title will reach $7.6 billion in revenue just 60 days after launch.</p><p>Josh Chapman--a managing partner of Konvoy--shared the company's GTA 6 forecast on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a> earlier this week. Konvoy's analysis makes certain assumptions that have yet to be confirmed by Rockstar, including an $80 base price and a $2 billion budget for the game itself. Those numbers are still conjecture, and the CEO of Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">Strauss Zelnick, recently said</a> that there is "way more value to a consumer than whatever that consumer pays," as opposed to "what the top-line price is."</p><p>Regardless, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will recoup its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and go on to become the biggest gaming launch of all time while shattering records for copies sold and revenue generated. By the end of the second month, Konvoy predicts that the game's total revenue will be $7.6 billion.</p><p>Intriguingly, Konvoy believes that GTA 6 will introduce a new UGC platform that allows mod creators to build their own areas of the game which will allow them to potentially be paid for their efforts through a creator economy that mimics UEFN and Roblox.</p><p>One of the last predictions is that GTA 6 will feature 200-person lobbies and a system that allows other players to steal weapons and items from each other.</p><p>Rockstar has been very secretive about GTA 6's details, but at least one leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">Drake will have his own radio station</a> in the game. It's also estimated that the decision to push the game out of 2025 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">will cost the industry $2.7 billion in revenue</a>.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

                <p>CD Projekt Red has lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-cyberpunk-2077-updates-were-thought-to-be-done-but-2-3-patch-launches-soon/1100-6532138/" data-ref-id="1100-6532138">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3</a>, revealing several of the big features coming to its open-world game. In a livestream featuring Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and several other members of the team, the studio showed off how the new update is primarily aimed at making Night City feel even more immersive by adding new vehicles, an AutoDrive feature, and even more features for the game's photo mode. The update will launch on July 17 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/" data-ref-id="1100-6532688">and it'll land on Switch 2 at a later date</a>.</p><p>Here's a quick breakdown of everything revealed during the stream.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</a></li><li><a href="#AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</a></li><li><a href="#Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</a></li><li><a href="#Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</a></li><li><a href="#More_cars_can_use_CrystalCoat">More cars can use CrystalCoat</a></li><li><a href="#Everything_else">Everything else</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Even_more_vehicles_to_collect">Even more vehicles to collect</h2><p>Gearheads can add three new cars and another motorcycle to V's garage once they complete several quests. Sasko added that these quests won't count towards earning a 100% completion rate in the game, and activating them will be easy to do. Here's the full list of new vehicles to collect via new side-jobs:</p><p><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Hunt and The Beast In Me. An additional side-job unlocks the CrystalCoat feature for it.</p><p><strong>Rayfield Caliburn Mordred</strong></p><p>Rewarded after completing the side-jobs The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search &amp; Destroy.</p><p><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></p><p>Unlocked after purchasing one Yaiba vehicle, purchasing three vehicles through Autofixer, and completing the side-job Reported Crime: You Play with Fire.</p><p><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></p><p>Available for purchase through Autofixer.</p><h2 id="AutoDrive_to_survive">AutoDrive to survive</h2><p>Feel like admiring the sights and sounds of Night City from inside one of your favorite cars? You'll be able to do just that with the AutoDrive feature, allowing you to go hands-free as you cruise around. This new mode--added to your rides as part of an in-universe software update--will turn your car into a self-driving vehicle and it follows the rules of the road when active. You'll need to be on a road to make use of it, but it looks like a nice option for getting around the city.</p><p>This function also has a "wandering" mode for going nowhere slowly, and it works with motorcycles. If you're attacked, it automatically deactivates. There's also a new "Cinematic Camera" that you can activate so that you can view your driving session from unusual angles.</p><h2 id="Delamain_taxis_are_also_available_to_call">Delamain taxis are also available to call</h2><p>For backseat tourism, you can now call Cyberpunk 2077's favorite AI program, Delamain, to dispatch one of its taxis to you, for a small fee. This feature unlocks after completing the job Don't Lose Your Mind.</p><h2 id="One_of_the_best_photo_modes_in_video_games_is_about_to_become_even_better">One of the best photo modes in video games is about to become even better</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2077's already expansive photo mode is being further improved with new options. You can choose from 27 new NPCs, set the time of day, and adjust the weather to help you nail that perfect snapshot. New stickers and frames are also being added, the depth-of-field option has been improved, and a new Color Balance tab will let you to create your own custom filters.</p><h2 id="Console_and_PC_upgrades">Console and PC upgrades</h2><p>For those of you looking to get the most graphical bang for your buck, Cyberpunk 2077 will support AMD FSR 3.1 once the update has been installed, and FSR 4 support is coming at a later date.
