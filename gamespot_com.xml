                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>
