                <p>Valve has seemingly introduced new rules that ban games that require users to watch paid ads (or rely on other such ad-based revenue models) from Steam. However, some sources report that these rules may have already existed, and that Valve has merely created <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="nofollow">a dedicated page</a> on Steamworks to clarify this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">The page explains that Steam does not contain paid advertising, and that advertising-based revenue models are not allowed on the platform. It further states that developers are also prohibited from using advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players an in-game reward for watching or engaging with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rule reads in part. "If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam."</p><p dir="ltr">This apparent change in Valve policy was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" rel="nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="nofollow">SteamDB</a> posted screencaps on BlueSky that seem to show that this policy has been in effect for at least five years on a different page, and that this new page is a dedicated space for it that states it in a different way. Regardless, Valve did recently introduce a significant change to its storefront: warnings that note if a game in Early Access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iibeow/steam_now_warns_about_early_access_that_have_not/" rel="nofollow">hasn't been updated</a> in more than a year. These alerts are ostensibly intended to inform users that the development timeline described on a game's page might not have come to fruition, or if the game has been outright abandoned.</p>

                <p>Since it's only February, it might be too soon to say that the action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is going to be a game of the year contender. But this title's popularity is already exploding. After launching on Steam last week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-off-to-an-enormous-start-on-steam/1100-6529234/" data-ref-id="1100-6529234">150,000 players concurrently</a>, the game hit an even larger peak over the weekend.</p><p>SteamDB has shared <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a chart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's performance</a>, and it rose from 176,000 players on February 5 to 190,000 on February 7. During the weekend, the game reached its current record of 256,206 concurrent players before settling back down to 188,000 players today. Regardless, the upwards trajectory of this title is impressive and it appears to still have room to grow. The game is also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, so the Steam numbers may only represent a small part of the overall picture.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has also been highly rated on GameSpot's sister site, Metacritic, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 88</a>. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-guides-hub/1100-6529183/" data-ref-id="1100-6529183">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> gave it a 9/10.</p><p>Senior designer Ondřej Bittner recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-dev-on-denying-instant-gratification-elder-scrolls-morrowind-influence/1100-6529328/" data-ref-id="1100-6529328">the influence that The Elder Scrolls games</a> have had on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, particularly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-review/1900-2870473/" data-ref-id="1900-2870473">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-review/1900-6168010/" data-ref-id="1900-6168010">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. The game also sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in a single day</a>. It's an intricately created world, and even the smallest details seem to matter, including NPCs' aversion to your character <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-npcs-can-catch-you-if-you-dont-bathe-and-smell-bad/1100-6529254/" data-ref-id="1100-6529254">if you don't bother to bathe</a>. Warhorse Studios has also laid out its roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Kingdom Come 2's post-release content</a>, which means players may be living in this world for some time to come.</p>
