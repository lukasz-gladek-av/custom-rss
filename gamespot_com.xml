                <p>The Coalition recently released a new gnasher-based <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1963373829780378081?t=IFRx0LBZMIjAQf0j50nDfg&amp;s=09" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update</a> for Gears of War: Reloaded. Though the iconic weapon had already received a bit of tuning (thanks to feedback from the beta), the Gears community still felt that there was room for improvement. This is especially true when it came to how much damage the gnasher inflicted on unsuspecting players--dying by this shotgun-like weapon outside of its immediate range of fire always felt a little unfair.</p><p>One of the gnasher's main issues has always been its (seemingly) inconsistent damage. A lot of the attributing factors beyond player skill--like server issues, proper bullet spread during hip firing, etc.--have already been addressed. This latest patch, however, seeks to adjust some finer points to bring the gnasher more inline with expectations. For instance, its mid-range damage has been reduced by 15%. The bullet spread when aiming down sights has also been adjusted; while it’s still tighter than the beta version, the spread isn’t as tight as it was at launch.</p><p>Thankfully, The Coalition didn't stop at fine tuning the gnasher. This latest patch fixed several game crashing/stability-based bugs and added new visual options like VRR support on Xbox Series X|S in campaign mode. One outstanding issue, which has contributed to "mixed" user reviews on Steam, is the lack of local split-screen co-op support on PC. It's unknown if that will be added in the future.</p><p>Below are the brief patch notes:</p><p>Gnasher weapon tuning:</p><ul><li>Based on community feedback, we've tuned the Gnasher:</li><li>Reduced power at mid-range:</li><li>Damage modifications: medium-range damage reduced by 15% - does not affect close range damage.</li></ul><p>Bullet spread not as tight when aiming down sights:</p><ul><li>The Shotgun Pellet Spread when aiming down sights is now less tight when targeting compared to the launch version, but it is still tighter than the beta.</li></ul><p>Crash &amp; Stability Improvements</p><ul><li>Several rare crashes and bugs have been fixed across all platforms, making your experience smoother.</li></ul><p>Performance &amp; Visuals</p><ul><li>Ultrawide 21:9 monitors supported in benchmark mode Support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) on Xbox Series X|S in campaign mode.</li></ul><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

Securing the rights to such an iconic franchise was no small feat, and as it turns out, the studio employed some creative methods that boiled down to making a super-spy Frankenstein with Agent 47 and Daniel Craig.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, IOI CEO and First Light game director Hakan Abrak said the process involved showcasing a unique in-game demonstration that merged elements of Hitman with the essence of Bond.</p>

<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there," Abrak revealed. "We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game." This demo took place within the well-known Hitman level Sapienza, specifically the section involving a hidden virus laboratory beneath the coastal town.</p><p>Since Craig stepped out of the role in 2021's No Time To Die, casting the new James Bond was an equally significant milestone for the project. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-110-screenshots-from-the-new-james-bond-action-game/2900-6982/" data-ref-id="2900-6982">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-will-star-patrick-gibson-as-legendary-super-spy/1100-6534458/" data-ref-id="1100-6534458">Irish actor Patrick Gibson steps into the role</a>, portraying a younger, more formative version of the MI6 agent. At just 30 years old--and playing Bond at the age of 26--Gibson is the youngest actor to take on the part to date.</p><p>"The way that works is less about looking for who becomes our Bond, who can shoulder this young version of the character? And I think working with big names is a different exercise," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-officially-casts-its-james-bond-and-its-exactly-who-you-thought-it-was" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained narrative director Martin Emborg</a>. "It's not finding the character as much as saying, 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if so-and-so were Bond?' I don't think that was super attractive at any point, actually."</p><p>This isn't the first time Daniel Craig's likeness has played a key role in bridging cinematic Bond with the gaming world. In the 2010 GoldenEye remake for the Nintendo GameCube, Craig's face was used to update the original 1997 Nintendo 64 classic with a more modern Bond aesthetic, replacing Pierce Brosnan's version of the character.</p><p>007: First Light is scheduled to be released on March 27, 2026. Preorders are available now, including a deluxe edition that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">comes with a golden gun</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

      </div>
<p>If that statement is true, then Bond fans can likely look forward to environments that they can explore for hours, given IO's talent for creating intricate levels. The Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy had no shortage of stages to explore, with some of its largest being the superb Sapienza level, a massive section of an opulent Dubai skyscraper, and the Club 27 warehouse in Berlin. The State of Play showed just how players can adopt a 007 mindset during each mission, as Bond can use his gadgets, fists, and wits to access new areas.</p><p>007: First Light launches on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. In case you missed the livestream, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/">14 new things we learned about the James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-110-screenshots-from-the-new-james-bond-action-game/2900-6982/">110 screenshots of the 007 adventure</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-meet-the-celebrity-cast-of-the-new-james-bond-game/2900-6981/" data-ref-id="2900-6981">the celebrity cast</a>, and take a closer look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/">$300 Specialist Edition</a> that comes with a golden gun replica.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>At long last, Hollow Knight: Silksong is releasing today, September 4, but the rollout hasn't gone entirely smoothly right out of the gate. People are reporting issues on Steam, with players saying they cannot launch the game or even add it to their cart. Issues have also been reported on the eShop, PSN, and Xbox, including Game Pass. Despite those issues, the game has blasted off to more than 100,000 concurrent players in the first 45 minutes availability on Steam alone.</p><p>For context, that's more concurrent players than the original Hollow Knight's all-time record of around 72,000.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The game's store page on Steam even totally vanished from the Steam home page. Players also reported that they cannot access the Steam store at all--this can happen sometimes at the launch of a new Steam sale. However, there aren't too many instances we can recall of this happening for a game launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562140" data-ratio="0.54637436762226" data-width="593" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562140"></a><figcaption>The error message some have reported seeing upon visiting Steam.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4562140-screenshot2025-09-04at10.09.45am.png"></figure><p>These issues aren't affecting everyone, as other players are reporting they're able to buy and download Silksong from Steam. On Switch 2, the game is apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lxzcsdgpic2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">encountering issues for some players as well on the eShop.</a> On Game Pass, Silksong is encountering issues as well. Game Pass members can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9N116V0599HB/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiate a download of the game remotely via Xbox.com.</a></p><p>As usual, your mileage may vary--many people appear to be booting into Silksong just fine. Despite the struggles for some, the game reached 75,000 concurrents on Steam in the first 10 minutes of availability, growing to 100,000 in the first 45 minutes.</p><p>Silksong had a huge amount of pre-release hype due in part to the game's lengthy development and status as a game people thought they might never get to play. But the day has finally come, and people appear to be flocking to Silksong.</p><p>As announced previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong costs $20</a> at launch on all platforms. There will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for original Switch owners.</p><h2><strong>What is Hollow Knight: Silksong?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's 2017 game Hollow Knight. The game sold more than 15 million copies and was highly regarded critically. The sequel, Silksong, was originally going to be DLC for Hollow Knight, but Team Cherry said its scope grew to the point that it had become a full, standalone game. Silksong has players becoming the character Hornet in a 2D platforming world. The game has new enemy types and bosses, and the <a href="https://www.altchar.com/game-news/team-cherry-post-hollow-knight-silksong-dev-update-e3-demo-axgGa3o4jK8P" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Greymoor area is among the biggest Team Cherry has ever created.</a></p><h2><strong>Why did Hollow Knight: Silksong take so long to come out?</strong></h2><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p><p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>One of the reasons why Silksong did not come out sooner was due to how, as previously stated, it was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight. As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><h2><strong>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong on Game Pass?</strong></h2><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">is available at launch for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers</a>. Alternatively, as mentioned, it can be purchased outright for $20.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

Melee modder is turning the tables on Nintendo by turning its cease &amp; desist letter into a playable character.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Mooshies_/status/1962052715649061032" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I put my Cease &amp; Desist Letter from Nintendo into Melee!<br>See how much court fines you can stack up against your opponents with this new skin over [COPYRIGHTED CHARACTER]!<br>Get it at your nearest courthouse, linked below! <br>Lawsuit compatible. <a href="https://t.co/QHXyo516z2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/QHXyo516z2</a></p>  — Moosh (@Mooshies_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mooshies_/status/1962052715649061032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/cease-desist-137761290?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cease &amp; Desist</a> was created by a modder who goes by Mooshies, and the skin replaces Kirby's usual appearance. Mooshies apparently has a very fun sense of humor, because a closer look at Cease &amp; Desist reveals lines that would never appear in an actual legal document from Nintendo: "Low key that mod do be sick though," and "Your mod too tough. Your Game &amp; Watch too different."</p><p>Mooshies was also behind the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-smash-bros-melee-mod-inserts-a-2024-gaming-darling/1100-6534246/" data-ref-id="1100-6534246">Jimbo the clown from Balatro mod</a>, which put that character's skin over Mr. Game &amp; Watch. That mod was initially paywalled behind Mooshies' Patreon account, before it was subsequently released for free. It's unclear if Mooshies actually received any legal notification from Nintendo before releasing the new Cease &amp; Desist mod. Mooshies jokes that the Cease &amp; Desist skin is available for "10 morbillion dollars"--a direct yet humorous retaliation to the backlash the modder faced for locking the Jimbo the Clown from Balatro skin behind a paywall. He has <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/hello-paywall-137359387?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">since clarified</a> that "all mods will be free" but Patreon backers will receive early access to them.</p><p>Earlier this year, former Nintendo employees Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-these-ex-nintendo-employees-think-super-smash-bros-melee-hd-will-never-happen/1100-6512664/" data-ref-id="1100-6512664">the publisher will never make Super Smash Bros. Melee HD</a> in part because of the game's history of piracy and mods. They also argued that it would be extremely difficult to please fans of the original title.</p><p>Fans recently predicted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-sleuths-think-super-smash-bros-donkey-kong-64-and-more-are-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6532987/" data-ref-id="1100-6532987">original Super Smash Bros. and four other Nintendo 64 titles</a> may soon be coming to Switch Online.
