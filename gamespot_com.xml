                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-developer-cancels-games-layoffs-coming/1100-6531972/" data-ref-id="1100-6531972">People Can Fly was hit by layoffs</a> and the cancelation of two unannounced projects. Now, two reports have indicated that one of the canceled games was Outriders 2, the sequel to the 2021 action-shooter that People Can Fly developed for publisher Square Enix.</p><p><a href="https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Thumb Wars</a> was the first outlet to report the story, which was subsequently corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outriders-2-cancelled/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>. In June, People Can Fly explained that one of the canceled games--under the name Project Gemini--was suspended over issues with the game's publishers regarding its failure to give the developer assets it needed to continue. It also noted that the publisher failed to maintain a dialogue with People Can Fly that would allow the two sides to finish the project.</p><p>Insider Gaming identifies Project Gemini as Outriders 2, and Square Enix as the publisher in question. The outlet reports that Outriders 2 wasn't nearly as close to completion as The Thumb Wars' report suggested, but there were no firm answers about what went wrong between People Can Fly and Square Enix.</p><p>People Can Fly had already laid off developers of <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/pcf-organizational-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a separate game known as Project Bifrost</a> last December, but development continued with a smaller team until last month's layoffs. Regardless of the latest staff reductions, People Can Fly is still working on a number of other titles including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> for Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-playstation-game-coming-from-gears-of-war-judgment-studio/1100-6530143/" data-ref-id="1100-6530143">Project Delta</a> for Sony, and <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> for Krafton.</p>
