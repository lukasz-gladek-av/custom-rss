                <p>If you've ever been on a ride at any of the major theme parks, then you should know that they can and will break at the most inopportune times. But at least one guest at Universal Studios' Super Nintendo World took full advantage of the Mario Kart ride's breakdown by lighting up a joint.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/highuniversal/status/1948103349171286376?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Universal High account on X</a> (via <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2025/07/guest-smokes-weed-mario-kart-universal-studios-hollywood/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WDWNT</a>), posted a video online of a guest riding the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge attraction during a stoppage. And as seen in the clip below, the guest lights up and smokes a little weed while waiting for the ride to resume.</p><p>Universal High was quick to point out that the video was first posted by someone else on Instagram, but that original video appears to have been removed. The currently unidentified fan does have some distinctive tattoos on his hand and thumb. But it's unclear if the individual was spotted by any of the park's employees or removed for lighting the joint.</p><p>Earlier this year, Universal Orland's new theme park, Epic Universe, opened up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-nintendo-worlds-donkey-kong-country-brings-pure-joy-to-epic-universe/1100-6530812/" data-ref-id="1100-6530812">an expanded Super Nintendo World</a>. Two of the latest attractions include Donkey Kong's Mine-Cart Madness and Yoshi Adventurer, as well as new things to find with the Power Up Bands worn by guests in the park.</p><p>Epic Universe also features four other new areas to explore, including Celestial Park, Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Ministry of Magic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-monsters-live-again-as-epic-universe-reveals-horrifying-dark-universe-animatronics/1100-6527459/" data-ref-id="1100-6527459">Dark Universe</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-reveals-epic-universes-how-to-train-your-dragon-land/1100-6522255/" data-ref-id="1100-6522255">How to Train Your Dragon-Isle of Berk</a>.</p>
