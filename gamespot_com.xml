                <p>Fans of Happy Gilmore will want to keep their remotes handy after watching the sequel, Happy Gilmore 2, on Netflix. The streaming platform has just released a new tie-in video game: Happy Gilmore: Golf Mayhem â€™98 Demo, available to all subscribers for free.</p><p>The retro-style game, <a href="https://amberstudio.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developed by Amber</a>, can be played on TVs and desktop devices. According to Netflix, the game offers a nostalgic '90s arcade experience, blending chaotic golf gameplay with combat-style mechanics reminiscent of Mortal Kombat. Players can golf, battle familiar characters, and wreak havoc across a cartoonish golf course--all in a short, punchy game packed with Easter eggs for longtime fans.</p><p>While the game takes place during the first Happy Gilmore movie, it's actually a nod to the opening scene in the sequel, where Gilmore has become a video game star a la Tony Hawk.</p><p>Netflix has also partnered with Spotify for a separate interactive experience, the Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament. Available within the Spotify app, the tournament features film-inspired golf challenges, classic audio clips, hidden references, and even a custom playlist to blast while you play.</p><p>Over the past three years, the company has expanded its library to over 100 titles, moving beyond mobile to include more web and TV-compatible games. While it continues to develop games tied to popular Netflix IPs such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squid-game-unleashed-lets-you-play-in-a-cartoonish-version-of-the-shows-capitalist-hellscape/1100-6525995/" data-ref-id="1100-6525995">Squid Game: Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-adds-another-game-to-its-library-based-on-a-black-mirror-episode/1100-6530778/" data-ref-id="1100-6530778">Black Mirror: Thronglets</a>, and Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game, the streamer is now focusing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-will-remove-all-of-these-games-in-july-2025/2900-6698/" data-ref-id="2900-6698">less on acquiring indie games</a> and more on developing more games tied to their original programming.</p>

                <p>If you thought Mario and Princess Peach had something special going on, think again, as a post on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-today-app-announced-will-include-switch-2-news-and-more/1100-6530427/" data-ref-id="1100-6530427">Nintendo Today app</a> has declared the plucky plumber and the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom are just "good friends."</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo news app recently included a profile on Princess Peach. Little did users know that the profile went out of its way to remove Mario as a romantic interest, declaring that "Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can."</p><p dir="ltr">Are we all being gaslit by Nintendo? Did all those times Peach kissed Mario over the years mean nothing? While the post is now gone thanks to the app's daily updates, users like <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KirPinkFury on X</a> definitely took notice, prompting all kinds of responses on social media.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from some smooches on the cheek, there isn't a ton of direct evidence that Mario and Peach have ever been romantically involved, but a guy usually doesn't storm castles and fight evil turtle dragons time after time for just "a good friend." Just saying.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario did actually propose to Peach at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-458832">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, seemingly implying that he, at least, thinks of Peach in a "more than just friends" way. However, Peach turns him down, probably because Bowser had just kidnapped her and tried to force her to marry him. Read the room, Mario! She needs some space.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, to deny that Mario and Peach aren't more than just friends seems a little silly. I mean, here's an entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EzcfBvaLLg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">montage of Peach kissing Mario</a> (with 2.2 million views). If Peach were really just Mario's "good friend," would she kiss Mario over a dozen times over the years? That's not something friends normally do, but I could be wrong (or need better friends).</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, it seems like Mario and Peach have joined the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-producer-wont-say-if-link-and-zelda-are-dating-is-up-to-players-imagination/1100-6519839/" data-ref-id="1100-6519839">Link and Zelda</a> as two Nintendo characters who are pretty much together, just not officially. Thanks, Nintendo.</p>
