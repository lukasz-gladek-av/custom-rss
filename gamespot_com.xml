                <p>From 1999 to 2017, Bruce Straley was one of the key players at Naughty Dog, and the co-director of two its best-selling games, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-reveals-why-he-left-naught/1100-6456223/" data-ref-id="1100-6456223">comments he made years ago</a>.</p><p>"I had been there 18 years. That's a long time for anybody to be anywhere," Straley told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I'm not saying there wouldn't be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine."</p><p>Straley went on to explain that he didn't jump to another AAA studio because he felt Naughty Dog was the "pinnacle" of developers that made the games he was interested in. And he didn't want to deal with "a whole different bureaucratic or cultural system."</p><p>"It really comes down to: Do you want to continue working for someone else and put in all the effort to build an IP, to build characters, to build things that a franchise could be built out of? I got paid very well there," added Straley. "I got some appreciation there, but it felt like it was time to break out and try it on my own. It felt like it was time to evolve my concepts and build a new team. It might fail miserably, but I thought that it was at least my failure based on my choice."</p><p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Straley's new team at Wildflower Interactive debuted their inaugural title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/debut-title-from-last-of-us-and-uncharted-co-director-revealed/1100-6536829/" data-ref-id="1100-6536829">Coven of the Chicken Foot</a>. It's a wordless single-player adventure that's completely unlike the games Straley made at Naughty Dog. Players assume control of a witch named Gertie and her creature companion as they try to fulfill her oath. The game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>The release of the upcoming RPG Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely far, far away.

The <a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">studio's careers page</a> contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-reminds-fans-that-cg-trailers-are-often-used-first-and-foremost-to-recruit-staff/1100-6496192/" data-ref-id="1100-6496192">tactic that developers often employ</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic: Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable.</p><p>"We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead," Hudson told StarWars.com. "I'm grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR<i> </i>fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!"</p><p>Since his work on the original KOTOR, Hudson stayed in contact with Lucasfilm, and the opportunity arose to make a new title in the Star Wars universe sometime after Arcanaut's founding.</p><p>Details are sparse on the premise. It isn't a direct sequel to Knights of the Old Republic, but Hudson says that the new game introduces new characters and will tell an "all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars<i> </i>that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p><p>The Old Republic has been making the headlines as of late, with a report claiming that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-full-star-wars-kotor-2-remake-was-in-development-report/1100-6536775/" data-ref-id="1100-6536775">KOTOR 2 remake was once in development</a> before being put on hold. And in other Star Wars news, The Game Awards 2025 also included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-announced-the-game-awards/1100-6536876/" data-ref-id="1100-6536876">reveal for Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>.</p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest collab is with Kim Kardashian, and in a new interview, the megastar discussed how the partnership came to be, how good she is at Fortnite, and how closely she worked with Epic to bring her vision to life.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69700805/kim-kardashian-fortnite-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elle Magazine</a>, Kardashian said she is a "decent" Fortnite player. "I wouldn't say I'm great, but I wouldn't say I'm horrible," she said. She added that her son, Saint, is "definitely better than I am."</p><p>"But, you know, he doesn't teach me all of his tricks," she said.</p><p>As for how she came to know Fortnite, Kardashian said her brother introduced her to the game years ago. And while she does play Fortnite, she only does so "moderately" because she believes things should be enjoyed "in moderation."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1t45vRyCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EE1t45vRyCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kardashian also confirmed that she worked closely alongside Epic Games on the collab, saying she spent an hour each night--from 10 to 11 PM--talking with Epic to "perfect everything" and ensure that "everything looked as realistic as possible."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kardashian said Fortnite is an "iconic" game and she is happy to join the ranks of high-profile people and brands that have come to the game over the years. "Just to have seen all of the previous characters and how cute they look, I was really excited to have my own character," she said.</p><p>Kardashian previously worked with Glu Mobile on the popular mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-kim-kardashians-mobile-game-is-really-popular/1100-6434875/" data-ref-id="1100-6434875">Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</a>, but it closed down in early 2024 after about a decade of operation. "I love the gaming space," she said in the interview with Elle.</p><p>One of the emotes for Kardashian in Fortnite is called "Slurp the Internet," and it's a reference to her famous "Break the Internet" shoot for Paper Magazine years ago. In that photo, she has a champagne glass on her butt, but in Fortnite, the champagne glass is on her foot. This is "because it could just fit better and look better," she said. Her other emote is called "Diamond Drop," and it's a reference to how she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJ7butR77g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a diamond earring in the ocean in Bora Bora while filming Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. She said she was "brutalized" over the mishap, and is now having some fun with it.</p><p>"You lose your diamonds in the ocean, and a little boat appears.

                <p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is "littered with falsehoods and disinformation."</p><p>IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">terminating the 30+ UK and international employees</a> in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason." More specifically, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/" data-ref-id="1100-6536894">Rockstar Games told GameSpot</a> that those developers were let go for discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate.</p><p>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals," the union said in an emailed statement. "Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</p><p>The situation has intensified since bursting in October 2025. Protests were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/07/uk-union-accuses-gta-maker-rockstar-games-of-firing-employees-attempting-to-organise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">formed outside Rockstar North's office</a> in Edinburgh. Over 200 Rockstar Games developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">signed a letter</a> demanding that those ousted workers be reinstated. Even the UK's Prime Minister said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">they will keep pressure on Rockstar Games</a> regarding the incident. All eyes are truly on this matter, as Rockstar Games and IWGB debate back and forth over how and why those developers were terminated and what sould be done about the situation.</p><p>In other union news, Doom developer id Software has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dev-id-software-forms-a-wall-to-wall-union/1100-6536938/" data-ref-id="1100-6536938">formed a "wall-to-wall" union</a> to protect its 165-person, Texas-based studio against AI while delivering better benefits. Microsoft has recognized that union.</p>
