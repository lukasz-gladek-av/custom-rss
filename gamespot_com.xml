                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the next big Switch 2 game, landing firmly within "launch window" status next month. Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said "Donkey Kong lore" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City. In this game she looks no more than 10 years old or so and hangs off DK's back as a companion character. Pauline has a dream, and DK is being exploited by his capitalist overlords, so together they head toward the planet core to make a wish. All completely normal so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the presence of a young Pauline implies that this is a prequel of sorts. DK has been rehabilitated from his villainous persona in the original Donkey Kong for years, but buddying up with Pauline as a little girl suggests that there was more to the story than we knew. As of the time when DK grabbed her and carried her to the top of a tower and forced Jump Man (aka Mario) to rescue her, they had a history. They were old friends! The mind reels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074"></a><figcaption>In Soviet Russia, monkey has person on his back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But then, the Bananza presentation threw another curveball by revealing that you can meet Cranky Kong. Now wait just a damn minute. What the hell is going on here?</p><p dir="ltr">As DK enthusiasts may recall, Cranky Kong is canonically the <em>original</em> Donkey Kong: The DK we've been playing throughout the Donkey Kong Country games, the one who is pals with Diddy Kong and the rest, is actually his more charismatic grandson. It was Cranky Kong who grabbed Pauline and climbed the tower and squared off against Jump Man.</p><p dir="ltr">So you may start to see the problem here. If old Cranky Kong is in this game, Pauline should be an adult. If Pauline is a kid, then Donkey Kong should be a slightly younger Cranky Kong who, 10 or so years in the future, will grab her and climb a bunch of girders. Having a fully-aged Cranky Kong and a young girl Pauline appear in the same game makes <em>absolutely no sense</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are ways to make it work. Donkey Kong Bananza could imply some kind of time-travel element in which Cranky Kong was sucked back into the past to meet his younger self. That possibility seems bananas, but frankly no more so than anything else we've seen from this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The more likely possibility in my mind, though, is that this version of Donkey Kong, Pauline, and Cranky Kong are entirely separate and distinct from the precious original continuity. Donkey Kong Bananza appears to be a sort of DK reboot, remixing familiar elements into a new continuity that is not bound by any of the storytelling conventions of the original. In other words: We've entered the DK multiverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe Nintendo is just making it up as they go. I may be overthinking this.</p>

The movie is being billed as similar in tone to the adult-focused anime movies like Predator: Killer of Killers and the upcoming John Wick animated prequel.</p><p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," Guzikowski said.</p><p>Line Mileage is producing the Death Stranding anime. CCO Daniel Dominguez said he believes Death Stranding is "the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game" he's ever played.</p><p>"Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell," he added.</p><p>It's still early days for the Death Stranding anime, and there is no word yet as to who is directing or lending their voices to the production. As for the live-action movie, Kojima is working with A24, with Michael Sarnoski (Pig, A Quiet Place: Day One) set to direct. Neither movie has a release date yet.</p><p>As for the Death Stranding game series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> releases on June 26 for PS5.</p>

The game's standard edition is $70, which is $10 more than what Borderlands 3 cost at launch, and that makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford quite happy. He said on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935048930955563192" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> that he is "so stoked" that publisher 2K decided to not raise the price to $80.</p><p>Some had theorized that Borderlands 4 would follow Mario Kart World in being priced at $80. Microsoft has plans to charge $80 for games as well, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2 later this year. 2K, however, isn't taking a one-size approach to all of its games, as Mafia: The Old Country will be $50 at launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Launch Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Pitchford added that he is similarly excited that "we're not doing any paid early access stuff" and that the team moved the game's release date up to September 12. Many modern games unlock early for people who pay extra, but Borderlands 4 isn't taking that approach. As for the release date, Borderlands 4 was originally set to debut on September 23 before moving ahead a few weeks.</p><p>What's more, Pitchford said he's happy that Gearbox is planning lots of post-launch DLC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">new Vault Hunters coming after launch for a fee.</a></p><p>While Borderlands 4's standard edition is $70, Gearbox is offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">$100, $130, and $150 editions of the game</a> for people who want to pay extra to get more stuff.

With revenue from Borderlands 4's premium edition and DLC sales factored in, the average selling cost of Borderlands 4 at launch may indeed be higher than $70, but final numbers may never be released.</p><p>The Borderlands franchise has sold nearly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">93 million copies to date</a>, and Borderlands 3 was 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. It's sold more than 22 million copies, but Borderlands 2 remains the best-selling entry in the series to date with more than 30 million copies sold.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later.</p>
