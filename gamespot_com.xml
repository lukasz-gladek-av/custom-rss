                <p dir="ltr">It's the season of giving, and Steam has a free gift up for grabs to keep you entertained over the holidays.</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 is a 2D arcade shooter set in--you guessed it--distant space, and is currently available for anyone to claim for free on Steam. A sequel to the original Space Distant, developer PixelMouse aptly describes the game as "an indirect continuation of the first part" that features "more dynamic gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Distant Space 2 challenges players to pilot a spaceship through 26 levels of enemies, including three special boss ships, which PixelMouse says are especially challenging. On the bright side, players can find unique weapons by destroying and looting enemy ships, which will make those boss fights a little less daunting.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your task is to destroy enemy ships on each level to go to the next of 26 available [levels]," the game's Steam page reads. "In addition to conventional ships, you will have to wait for the boss ships, the battle with which will not be easy."</p><p>Distant Space 2 is currently available to play for free on Steam (download it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729460/Distant_Space_2/" rel="nofollow ">here</a>), but this no-strings-attached gift won't be around forever, so players will want to add this title to their library before the 100% discount expires on December 24 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. If you prefer to play its predecessor first, you can get your hands on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/5251/Distant_Space_Pack/" rel="nofollow ">Space Distant and Distant Space 2</a> for only $0.73 USD.</p><p>For even more Steam-powered savings, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2024-game-deals/2900-6097/" data-ref-id="2900-6097">the best deals featured in this year's Steam Winter Sale</a>.</p>
