                <p>Streaming platform Twitch has announced a big change to its monetization policy, as "most streamers" will soon gain access to the site's monetization tools. Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners could access these revenue-generating tool, but these will be available to more creators later in 2025.</p><p>"We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you're just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while," Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We're excited to open up monetization tools--subscriptions and bits--to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage. We're also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch."</p><p>Previously, earning a Twitch partnership required a user to have 50 followers, an average of three viewers per stream, and at least eight hours of cumulative streaming across at least seven different days. That process could be daunting for new streamers given the competitive nature of Twitch, but it was generally achievable if a person was consistent with their efforts.</p><p>Beyond this big change, Clancy also explained other plans for Twitch in 2025. The company is working on features to help partners earn more money while collaborating, both landscape and vertical video through enhanced broadcasting tools will be added to improve the mobile viewing experience, and the tools to edit clips will also be improved. These updates come shortly after <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1892277199497043994" rel="nofollow ">Twitch announced that it'll be implementing a 100-hour storage cap</a> on highlights and uploads starting April 19, a move that has not gone over well with a large part of its userbase.</p><p>While the company cites a need to save on storage costs and video highlights not being as popular as it envisioned as reasons behind the move, users have noted that Twitch's parent company Amazon is one of the biggest names in cloud storage, leading to criticism of the cost-cutting measure.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the biggest sports game ever in the US according to Circana, and it seems that the publisher is considering bringing back its take on college basketball, which has been dormant for more than a decade. In a recent report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports senior vice president Daryl Holt said that college basketball (and other sports) remain a possibility, but reiterated that American football is still the publisher's main priority.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a clear need, want, desire from our community and the faithful were there [for college football]," Holt said. “As developers, we try to figure out how we can get creative on reaching other aspects of sports, whether that be a smaller sport or one that doesn't have a game. But right now, my focus has been on American football. We'll keep looking for those things, but as a developer and working in sports, you're always tapping your head going, what else could be possible?”</p><p dir="ltr">The last EA Sports-published NCAA basketball game, NCAA Basketball 10, came out in 2009 and featured the now-retired dunk contest champ Blake Griffin as the cover athlete. While any plans for a new college basketball game remain quite nascent, it's likely that EA would try to get as many student athletes as possible to sign to a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal. More than 11,000 FBS football players opted into CFB 25's deal last year, receiving $600 and a copy of the game as compensation for their NIL rights. The NIL deal for CFB 26 is reportedly still being negotiated, though EA declined to comment on those plans. The CFB series itself lay dormant for more than a decade, the last release coming in 2012 before last year's revival restored its fortunes.</p><p dir="ltr">Holt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-new-college-football-26-features/1100-6529751/">teased new features</a> coming to this year's sequel, CFB 26, including possible improvements to the single-player career mode Road to Glory. CFB 25 was the second-best selling game of 2024 in the US, second only to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Mega Evolutions will be making a return</a>, so it's possible that the starters could receive those. There's been a precendent set with Mega Evolutions where some get new typing, such as Mega Ampharos being Electric/Dragon instead of pure Electric type and Pinsir becoming a Bug/Flying type when it Mega Evolves instead of staying pure Bug.</p><p>Let's take a look at what we know about the three starters and what potential changes Legends Z-A could bring to them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290"></a><figcaption>The three starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A (from left to right): Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg"></figure><h2>Chikorita</h2><p>Chikorita is the Grass type starter from Generation 2, and is unfortunately the worst starter of its trio, as well as considered to be one of the worst starters historically. That's mostly due to the shallow pool of moves its final form, Meganium, can learn and its mediocre stats. However, a Mega Evolution or alternate form could drastically improve Meganium.</p><p>Nintendo could lean into Meganium's reptilian design and give it a secondary Dragon typing. Meganium already learns some Dragon type attacks, including Dragon Tail and Outrage, but a secondary Dragon type would also power them up by 50% due to STAB, or Same Type Attack Bonus. This would make Meganium more offensively viable.</p><p>Meganium is more defensively oriented, and a Dragon typing would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would bolster its already impressive resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric moves. However, it would add Dragon and Fairy weaknesses.</p><p>An alternate form with the Grass/Fairy typing would give Meganium the best of both worlds, defensively and offensively. Fairy is regarded as one of the best types in Pokemon so far.</p><p>A secondary Fairy type would gives Meganium an immunity to Dragon type attacks and new resistances to Dark and Fighting type attacks, while only adding one additional weakness to Steel type attacks. However, it would now take quadruple damage from Poison-type attacks instead of double. A secondary Fairy typing also cancels out Meganium's weaknesses to bug types too, making them only do neutral damage.</p><p>Offensively, Fairy is a powerful type, hitting Dark, Dragon, and Fighting types for extra damage. However, Meganium will still struggle against Fire and Poison types, as they resist Fairy type attacks.</p><h2>Tepig</h2><p>Tepig is the Fire starter from Generation 5 and its final evolution is Emboar, a Fire/Fighting type. With high offensive stats on both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, along with a versatile attacking movepool, Emboar doesn't need as much as a drastic change like Meganium. However, if Nintendo wants to switch up Emboar's typing in a Mega Evolution or alternate form, one possibility is Fire/Ground. Thematically, that would fit Emboar as a pig, rolling around in the mud.</p><p>A secondary Ground typing might actually make Emboar worse, as it would take quadruple damage from Water type attacks and lose its Grass resistance. However, it would gain an Electric immunity. Either way, Emboar is fine as it is, and it's possible that it could retain its Fire/Fighting typing if given an alternate form.</p><h2>Totodile</h2><p>Totodile is Generation 2's Water type starter. Of the Johto trio, it's the most physically offensive, making it a popular option. Its final evolution is Feraligatr, which, like Emboar, also doesn't need a massive overhaul. Feraligatr is a pure Water type, so it's possible that it could gain a secondary typing.</p><p>The secondary typing that makes the most sense thematically for Feraligatr would be Dark, as that plays into Totodile's mischievous and playful nature. Plus, Feraligatr already learns plenty of Dark type moves such as Bite, Crunch, Fake Tears, Snarl, and Lash Out. A secondary Dark typing would also give its Dark attacking moves the STAB bonus.</p><p>Feraligatr is reptilian, just like Meganium, so a Water/Dragon typing fits too. Feraligatr already learns moves like Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Dragon Dance. As long as a Mega Evolution or alternate form of Meganium isn't Grass/Dragon, Feraligatr can go down the route as a Dragon type, as I don't imagine Nintendo would want to double up on the Dragon typing for two starters.</p><p>Pokemon Legends Z-A is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">launch in late 2025 for Nintendo Switch</a>. It'll have a new take on the traditional Pokemon battle system, including real-time elements with attack moves that have a certain amount of reach. Moving Pokemon out of the way will cause attacks to miss.</p>
