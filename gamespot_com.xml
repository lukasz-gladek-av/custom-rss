I always approach From Software titles with a methodical and slow style. When I started playing this game, everything felt like it was in fast-forward so it felt very unnatural for a little while. Is that [impact on longtime fans] something that you thought about when designing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Junya Ishizaki</strong>: One of the initial game concepts for Nightreign stemmed from creating a new sense of battle. I was a battle designer on Elden Ring and previous From titles; I wanted to take that in a new direction and try something new and fresh with the battle. But I wanted to do something new and expand on that. So, taking the battle systems of Elden Ring and expanding on those and changing the tempo was something we put great importance on when creating Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What has it been like to have your scope expanded beyond the battle [elements of a game]? Now you are custodian of an entire gameplay experience.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course coming from a battle designer to a director of a game brings with it a lot more freedom. I have to make a lot more decisions. I have to look at a lot more of what's going on in other areas of the game. But this new freedom and this new scope is very liberating and very fun, but also quite challenging. Obviously there are many, many staff involved and a lot of people with different opinions that you have to take into account. But that aspect is especially interesting and it helped me to understand this new difficulty in making games. But it's not just about designing the battle, even on Elden Ring, while I was assisting with that. It was intended to make the game more interesting as a whole, so being able to translate that into a directorial role has been really fulfilling and really interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449"></a><figcaption>In Nightreign, you take on challenges as a member of a squad of three.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was trying to pay attention to how core principles or design decisions that are unique to From Software are manifesting in this game. One of the important ones is a sense of self-growth, where you learn and overcome challenges. From your perspective, where in Nightreign's gameplay loop is that found? And how do you account for implementing that when there are randomized elements?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First of all, thank you for your comments about our games. It sounds like you are quite familiar with them and you understand them to quite a deep degree. And as you say, this kind of self-growth of the player that we sort of put a lot of trust in them to learn and to overcome these challenges. That is a crucial aspect of Nightreign, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">We would say one way in which it differs from previous titles and Elden Ring is the player planning aspect. So in something like Elden Ring, it's a lot more of a long play. You have an extended experience and extended journey which culminates eventually in a boss battle. But for Nightreign, it's something that is a little bit more on the fly--it's a little bit more loose and it's a little bit more ad-lib. Players have to make these decisions and change their build and, maybe even their play style, on the fly while they're going through this gameplay loop. So we feel like this will provide a new way for the player to learn and to grow during their adventure with Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Was the battle royale format always the framework that you wanted to work within or was there experimentation and you arrived at that format being the best place for your style of game and the game you wanted to make?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The battle royale-type structure was not considered to be the base of the game. It wasn't a starting point, it was something that sort of took shape, or elements of these games took shape during development of Nightreign. For instance, the Ring of Reign that closes in around the field is definitely something that players will be familiar with, but it wasn't there from the start. It's something that we implemented in order to encourage that movement and to guide the player's route through the map, and encourage their decision-making. That's something that we tried and we thought it worked well, so it stuck.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Many parts of what I experienced in Nightreign were the complete opposite of what I come to From Software games for. I'm one of those people who really loves the feeling of isolation and then I start playing this and immediately I've got two friends next to me. Was there ever a worry that this could impact the tone of the game or how From Software usually present their games in terms of atmosphere?</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448"></a><figcaption>You can glide above the world in Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We definitely appreciate that players like yourself got into the tone and that sort of sense of isolation when enjoying these games. And we do want to feel like the tone is not too divided from Elden Ring in terms of atmosphere and setting. However, [for] players who might otherwise be intimidated by Elden Ring's structure and facing that deep dark world alone, we feel like this is an opportunity for them to find a more approachable experience and just jump right into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">And also, while it's designed as a multiplayer game and you are likely to find playing among other people, we do feel like this is a game that you can queue up for solo. And in matchmaking, if you have matchmaking set, you can all go your different ways on the map and you can spread out and do your own thing. You don't <em>have</em> to babysit one another, but eventually it will culminate in this shared experience of a cooperative boss battle. While it is a multiplayer game, we want this to feel like a loose and flexible experience that retains some of that feeling of isolation and feeling of going off into the unknown on your own, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that I thought was interesting was the way that over the course of a run I experienced pretty much every foundational and important aspect of a role-playing game experience and also a From Software experience. There was exploration, character development, a challenge to overcome, for example. I know this is something that you've talked about before but what was the thinking behind that and how difficult was it to achieve that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One thing about these games is that there's an awful lot of weapons and equipment and player actions to choose from. And when making Nightreign, we wanted to figure out a new way in which players could have access to these and enjoy these in a different way. Of course, each player has their own preference and maybe they go into the game with a prerequisite of what sort of character they're going to build and what kind of weapon they want to use, so obviously they will have a lot of things that they're unfamiliar with and that they don't necessarily like using or don't necessarily go in with an intent to use. But we wanted players to feel more comfortable and like they were able to approach the things they don't know and aren't familiar with a lot easier in Nightreign. We wanted to keep this large selection of weapons and abilities very open and available to use, and free for players to experiment with and mix and match with. We wanted this to be one of the driving factors of Nightreign's gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, just because of the wealth of parameters in this game, you have to choose your character attributes, you have to choose your weapon, how that weapon performs, that weapon's attributes. One of the challenges involved in implementing this was [how it] creates a whole lot of moving parts. And while we wanted to streamline that in a way, if you streamline and cut back too much that starts to lose the fun and lose the element of interest and surprise. And so it was a difficult balancing act to try to get these two things to live in harmony with one another, the streamlining and this experimentation. But we feel like we've landed in a good place with the final product.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450"></a><figcaption>Looking cool is always the number one priority in a Souls-like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When I was picking a character, it felt like I could identify certain archetypes of characters that I'm familiar with: healer, soldier, tank, and so on. But then when I got into the game and noticed there were very few restrictions on what I could use and how I could craft that build from that point on, it was an interesting experience because then I felt a little more free to experiment. At the same time, I was a little confused about what my role should be on the team. Do you expect people to try and fulfill roles or do you expect people to just build who they want and try to find the synergy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, this is something we were conscious of during development. Of course, you have some of these character archetypes, like the guardian, who, just from their looks and from their abilities and from the outset, you understand, "Oh, this is probably closest to a tank-type character." Players want to dive in with that mindset and this was, of course, intentional. But we didn't want players to feel restricted by that archetype or by that role. We wanted to keep the essence of these games that allow you to be loose and change up your play style, change up your equipment on the fly, and change as you go through. We wanted to really emphasize that with Nightreign, so we didn't want to restrict that too much. So while players can approach this from a role-playing or a team role aspect, we didn't want to restrict them too much in that sense. We wanted to keep it quite flexible. This was very intentional.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you come up with the abilities for the Nightfarers? Some of them are really interesting. Like Duchess, for example, being able to repeat damage. The Recluse has a really cool ability where you siphoning magic from around you and building a spell. Where did that idea come from? And if it's just, "my brain," then silly question on my part.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Essentially these ideas came from myself and the team. We tried our best to think up some original and unique abilities for each character. A lot of us, myself included, play a lot of games. We love gaming, we love doing battle with these enemies in different ways [in] different titles. And so when we designed these characters and these abilities our main focus was, "Well, what's fun about using them? Why do we enjoy the feeling of using these abilities?" With the Recluse, they're a magic-oriented character. So what's fun about using magic? It's using your intelligence. It's using your brain, and figuring out the enemy's weak point, and figuring out how to use your magic effectively. So a lot of the characters were designed, and the abilities were designed with this at the forefront; just thinking what's fun about being this role and how we can effectively translate that into game feel.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2117306062" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

also interesting. I have a one-track mind, so if I know I like great swords, anything that doesn't look like a great sword is getting filtered out of my brain, usually. But with this system, I was forced to pay attention to everything. And, even if I had no intention of using it, I'd still grab things because there was a buff I wanted. What was the thinking behind that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The passives that you speak of tie back to the aspect of balancing the game between the overwhelming amount of parameters and wanting to have a fun feeling of experimentation and changing on the fly. The passives were something that offered that variety and that ability to experiment. It's something that we landed on quite early in development [and] we wanted to keep that going forward as a solution to that balance problem.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, from a balancing perspective in terms of the meta gameplay, we want players to feel like there was something there that they could tap into, get really crazy combinations, and figure out how they could synergize their build with these passives and their equipment and their abilities. This was just another element that allowed us to really imagine the player possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Attacking your teammates also heals them when they're downed. I had this moment where I was trying a katana but I had a halberd in my back pocket specifically just to revive my teammate because it has a good sweeping attack and, if I needed to, I could hit them from a distance while also hitting the enemy, which was really cool. How did you come up with the idea of attacking your friends to heal them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When designing the revival with this being a multiplayer game and having allies close by in mind, we did consider several traditional methods such as approaching your downed ally and holding a revive button--things like this. But we felt like a lot of these didn't quite maintain that sense of tension and that sense of focus in battle that we wanted to keep; that flow of battle in Nightreign. So when considering this, again, from a character perspective and what feels good, one of the more obvious conclusions we landed on was, well, we have a wide variety of attacks and abilities, why don't we try to leverage those? And this is just something that we tried throughout the course of development and it felt like it was working well. People responded well to it, and so we started to build on that.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1897336102" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

like that. Is there a concrete explanation for why this is happening and is it part of the story or is it just one of those things where it's for gameplay reasons or it's a good use of assets that already exist?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The primary reason for these existing bosses in Nightreign is from a gameplay perspective. Of course, with this new structure and with this new style of game, we needed a lot of different bosses. We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles.</p><p dir="ltr">We obviously understand that our players have a lot of affection for these characters and they have a lot of fond memories of battling them in these games, so we didn't want to encroach too much on that lore aspect. We wanted them to make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr">But mainly from a gameplay perspective, we wanted to incorporate these bosses, make adjustments to them to suit the gameplay of Nightreign and to make sure they felt at home. But it was more so from a numbers perspective. And just to add to that quickly, also from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun. So that's one simple reason why we included some of these old bosses.</p>

                <p>Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have released the biggest update for Ninja Gaiden 2 Black yet. Specifically, the update adds modern features like New Game+ and photo mode, which weren't nearly as prevalent when Ninja Gaiden 2 was originally released.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-33086">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> launched for Xbox 360 in 2008. In January, an Unreal Engine 5 remake called Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow-dropped during Xbox's Developer Direct showcase following the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is faithful to the game it's a remake of, but did add some more modern features, like easier difficulty modes. Now, the developers are expanding that new feature set further in the latest patch.</p><p>This update, which is Ver 1.003.000 on PS5 and Ver 1.0.7.0 on PC and Xbox Series X|S, adds three new features: New Game+, Photo Mode, and the ability to hide Ryu's projectile weapon. New Game+ allows people to replay Ninja Gaiden 2 Black with all the weapons and Ninpo they obtained during the adventure. They will all be reverted to Level 1, though, so players won't be completely overpowered heading into New Game+.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442783" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442783"></a><figcaption>Players will now be able to hide the bow on Ryu's back during gampelay.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg"></figure><p>The other two features can be found in the options menu. Photo Mode gives players an easier way to take screenshots of what they are playing, while a "Show Projectile Weapon" option in the Game Settings sub-menu allows players to toggle whether or not they want the weapons to appear on Ryu's back during gameplay, which should be useful if they're using one of the bigger projectile weapons but want better visibility during combat.</p><p>This update makes some other adjustments and bug fixes, so you can check out the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of patch notes</a> below:</p><h3>Additional Content:</h3><ul><li>New Game+<br>Added the ability to begin a new game on a difficulty level you have previously cleared with the weapons and Ninpo you obtained in your previous playthrough already unlocked.

                <p>Finnish game developer Remedy has released its <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=de036915-53b0-4bfc-8564-7ce4872914e5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings report</a>, and included in the filing are some key updates for the developer's upcoming games. Perhaps the two biggest takeaways are the confirmation that Control 2 has now entered full production, while Alan Wake 2 has finally recouped its development costs after selling 2 million copies.</p><p>In its filing, Remedy said Control 2 "entered full production" in February 2025. "The project has verified the velocity of asset creation, established production pipelines, and is ready for scaling up for production," the developer said.</p><p>Entering the "full production" phase is a significant milestone for any project. Another high-profile game, CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, entered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">full production phase of development</a> at the end of 2024.</p><p>As announced previously, Annapurna is funding 50% of Control 2's budget, and that budget has never been disclosed and likely never will be. Annapurna is co-funding the game as part of a deal that will see Annapurna help bring Remedy's Control and Alan Wake franchises to film and TV. The Chinese gaming giant Tencent is also an investor in Remedy and its upcoming projects.</p><p>These other upcoming games include FBC: Firebreak, a multiplayer game launching in 2025 that is self-published by Remedy, as well as remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2 in partnership with Rockstar Games. Firebreak and the remakes are both now in full production.</p><p>As for Alan Wake 2, the game has now sold 2 million copies and has begun to accrue royalties for Remedy. As recently as November 2024, the game remained unprofitable for Remedy. Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/record-year-for-remedy-despite-no-new-game-releases" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">funded Alan Wake 2</a> with the agreement being that once development and publishing costs were made back, further revenue would be split between Epic and Remedy.</p>

                <p>Crytek has announced that it'll be laying off 15% of its staff, a move that the company has called "inevitable" but necessary to help it move forward. This will affect 60 of the people from the 400-person staff at Crytek, which the company had previously attempted to avoid by putting the development of Crysis 4 on hold near the end of 2024 so that it could focus more on its live-service game Hunt Showdown: 1896.</p><p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," Crytek founder Avni Yerli wrote in a press statement. "It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896."</p><p>Yerli added that efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses weren't enough to avoid layoffs. The studio will offer affected employees severance packages and help in finding new work, and while Crysis 4 is being put on hiatus, Crytek will continue to work on Hunt: Showdown 1896. The game has seen a surge in popularity lately--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/post-malone-comes-to-hunt-showdown-in-murder-circus-event-as-game-hits-game-pass/1100-6528411/">possibly due to Post Malone being a big advocate for it</a>--and legendary horror movie villain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hunt-showdown-gets-its-first-crossover-character-with-this-legendary-horror-villain/1100-6527323/">Ghostface was added</a> to the roster of villains in late 2024.</p><p>Crytek joins a growing list of companies that have announced layoffs recently, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard developer BioWare</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamworld-creators-announce-incoming-layoffs-and-focus-on-third-party-games/1100-6527791/">SteamWorld creators Thunderful Games</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unknown-9-deemed-a-failure-as-developer-cancels-future-project-and-confirms-layoffs/1100-6528909/">Unknown 9: Awakening developer Reflector Entertainment</a> have all been forced to downsize.</p>

Based on the few hours I've spent playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-599968">Killing Floor 3</a>, this latest entry could be the one to push the co-op shooter from something I eventually tire of to one I end up returning to for years.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, of course, a scenario that will require a lot of things to come together. Will the metagame be sufficiently interesting over a long period of time? Will no competitor emerge to capture the community's attention? Will the post-launch support be consistent and long-term enough to keep players coming back? On that last point, at least, I'm confident, given the <a href="https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Updates_(Killing_Floor_2)" rel="nofollow ">extensive array of updates for Killing Floor 2</a> that have rolled out for the better part of a decade.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 Is Exactly What It Needs To Be (Hands-On Impressions)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The answers to the other questions are unknowable for this or any game in advance of its release and will require dozens of hours of playtime to determine. But what I've seen so far of Killing Floor 3 is an encouraging and exciting base that I'm eager to spend more time with.</p><p dir="ltr">The most immediate and obvious change, even before getting into a match, concerns how classes work. I'd always found the previous name for these--perks--confusing, since that term evokes individual skills, rather than classes. These are now referred to as specialists as part of a broader change that, not unlike Rainbow Six Siege or the early version of Battlefield 2042, pair a specific character with what would have previously been referred to as a perk. That has the potential downside of forcing you to adopt a particular look you may not care for in order to get the benefits of playing as a particular class. But the real challenge to me in picking a specialist was forgoing the special abilities that others would have access to, because I found every one of them so fun to use.</p><p dir="ltr">These abilities are cooldown-based, allowing you to freely use them over the course of a match; you just need to weigh the right time to deploy them, lest you find yourself in dire need and unable to use it. I initially played as the Firebug character, Devlin, who has access to Wildfire, an ability that slams the ground and deals an area-of-effect attack. The immediate and devastating impact of this, which comes with the benefit of also dealing with enemies behind you, made it incredibly useful, not to mention making me feel like a hero for leaping in and saving my group from being overwhelmed on several occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The gadget available to the Ninja--one of two brand-new specialist types alongside the Engineer--also proved to be a great deal of fun. It's a grappling hook that pulls you to an enemy to deal a burst of damage and conveniently puts you within range to start slicing away with your katanas. But beyond the inherent utility of rapidly relocating, you'll also annihilate the enemies you make contact with on your way.</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja was initially the specialist I was least interested in trying; I often find melee weapons in gun-centric games to be underwhelming, not to mention the potential difficulty of learning the game while actively putting myself in harm's way. Much to my surprise, Ninja might have been the most entertaining specialist of the bunch; not only does slicing through Zeds with katanas feel great, but having access to bows and shurikens provides enough long-distance options that I felt I could back off at times and still be effective. (You can still also buy any weapon, regardless of which specialist it's associated with.) The shurikens, which can be very rapidly flung at foes, have a satisfying metallic <em>shink</em> to them that encouraged me to back off every now and then just so I could use them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3's Sharpshooter, Ninja, and Medic specialists</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442468,1300-4442469,1300-4442470" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much as I enjoyed each specialist's ability, my favorite was easily the Sharpshooter's Death Hand, which is effectively just the homing arrow that Yondu of Marvel fame uses. Deploy it and it begins zipping around, slaying enemies quicker than you'd be able to target them yourself. It's a thrilling display, not just killing enemies but flinging their bodies to the ground through the sheer impact in a way that had me eager for its cooldown to reset so I could do it all again. You can keep firing your weapon as the arrow does its thing, although I found myself instead standing back and admiring its handiwork. It's possible that enjoyment will wane after using it in match after match, but my initial impression was that this is one of the most entertaining attacks I'd ever used in a video game. It's that good.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of what makes Death Hand so much fun to use is the weight behind this and every attack. There's a real heft behind each bullet fired, with Zeds recoiling as they absorb the blows. I've never quite clicked with Call of Duty's Zombies modes in part because shooting its zombies doesn't feel as satisfying as I hope, perhaps because the core mechanic is primarily designed around combat against quick-to-die players.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 feels better than the series ever has. Through great sound design and the way enemies are staggered by attacks, you never feel as though you're firing mushy peas against a cardboard box. Even heavy-duty enemies who are difficult to kill react to your gunfire, and the ability to target weak spots to temporarily stagger them provides momentary reprieves that also help to mitigate any sense that they are bullet sponges.</p><p dir="ltr">Zed Time makes a return in Killing Floor 3 with an added dose of welcome predictability. Rather than being chance-based, a meter at the top of the screen shows your progress toward triggering it. As before, it slows down time for everyone, letting you easily line up headshots or process your surroundings and have a moment to decide your next action. Kills during this time extend the duration of the effect, while there is a brief period after it ends during which your kills don't contribute to your next Zed Time. What makes Zed Time here even better is that all nearby enemies are highlighted in red, including those behind walls and other obstacles. That gives you a real edge in combat, which can become chaotic, as well as the ability to line up headshots before an enemy has even rounded a corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the sheer utility of Zed Time, though, is the fun of seeing the game's gore system, known as MEAT (Massive Evisceration and Trauma), at work in even gorier detail. Moving from less graphically violent shooters like Marvel Rivals or even Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to Killing Floor 3 is jarring at first, to say the least: Heads go flying off into the distance, blood gets everywhere, Zeds missing their bottom halves desperately crawl toward you, bodies explode. Developer Tripwire clearly isn't holding back here, going over the top with its gore in a way that feels fun and silly, in a classic Evil Dead kind of way. It can just be hard not to waste some of your precious Zed Time beholding the impact that a slice of your katana has on a Zed in slow motion.</p><p dir="ltr">Other positive additions include an execution system, which, much like modern Doom's Glory Kills, allows you to approach low-health enemies and finish them off with a gruesome attack. Doing so means needing to get close, but the upside is the damage these attacks deal to nearby foes, lending a nice risk-and-reward element that provides another strategic consideration in the heat of combat.</p><p dir="ltr">The time between rounds also now affords you more things to do. Rather than simply running to the trader pod to stock up on new weapons or ammo, or physically flinging your excess cash to share with teammates, you'll find objects throughout the environment to destroy, as well as certain doors and devices that can be activated using a Multi-Tool, one of the consumable tool options. Ziplines, sentry guns, and armor lockers are among the things that are inactive until a Multi-Tool brings them online, and all of which can provide life-saving getaways or assistance. While Multi-Tools can be used during a round, quick players can purchase one from the trader, activate some devices, and then swap to another tool for use during the round itself. (There's also now a menu-based way to share cash with teammates, but you can still just chuck cash on the ground, too.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also scattered throughout levels are destroyable objects, which grant cash for the current match and crafting materials for use in a new hub area between matches. I do worry that taking out these objects could become a rote objective over time as you memorize their placement and take them out match after match, but the broader attempt to spice up this downtime period is welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether destroying those speakers and other objects eventually becomes boring or not, doing so might prove worthwhile in the long term to provide yourself with more crafting materials, which are also gathered from killing Zeds in various ways. Crafting is a system I didn't get to spend much time with, but you'll be able to create mods to attach to weapons, versions of which you'll then buy during a match. But even without having done any crafting myself, the lineup of weapons available at the trader included versions with randomized mods. The effect of some mods was unclear to me as I rushed to get things done between waves, but it's clear that aside from simply improving their performance, they can have major effects on weapons. They might dramatically alter the size of your magazine in exchange for certain benefits or concessions, change their damage type (thereby altering the types of enemies and armor they're effective against), or add entirely new effects--at one point, I got a grenade launcher with freezing rounds. Suddenly a weapon I'd otherwise only use to attack large groups of enemies had a new utility in temporarily halting the advance of whole groups of Zeds. This one example might overstate the overall impact mods will have on the average match, but the additional diversity they might bring to weapons is very promising.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside mods, the other big progression system involves skill trees for each specialist. Upgrades for Killing Floor 2's perks always struck me as underwhelming--yeah, better reload speeds or higher damage are all well and good, but they're not terribly exciting, nor do they really affect the way you think about a combat engagement. While there remain some simple percentage-based upgrades in Killing Floor 3's skill trees, they seem to often be paired with an additional effect to factor into your playstyle. For instance, a Firebug upgrade that grants faster reload speeds also makes it so that every reload damages nearby enemies and causes them to panic, interrupting their advance. This encourages you to consider your positioning each time you reload, and it's these kinds of possibilities that get me excited about upgrading each specialist. Combine an upgrade like that with a weapon that can be reloaded early and often, plus one of the Ninja's melee weapons, and what does combat look like? I can't wait to play around with all of the potential options.</p><p dir="ltr">With cross-play across all platforms, the promise of weekly mutations that can potentially shake up matches to keep things fresh, great metal music that amps up the intensity, player-specific objectives to attempt alongside slaying Zeds, and a history of great post-launch support, Killing Floor 3 looks like a killer co-op package. Only extensive time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term, but right out of the gate, Killing Floor 3 should be a blast.
