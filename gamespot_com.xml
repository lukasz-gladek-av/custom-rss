                <p>Between Ninja Gaiden and Rise of the Ronin, Team Ninja has been pretty busy lately. The developer is keeping the pace into 2026 with the release of Nioh 3 on PS5 on February 6. Preorders are now live, and if you act fast, you can get the limited <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nioh 3 Steelbook Launch Edition</a> for $70.

While not technically a preorder bonus, the Steelbook Launch Edition is only available in limited quantities--so while it's possible you could find a copy after launch, it's best to preorder if you're interested in this version. A standard physical edition is available, though it doesn't include the steelcase or extra in-game accessories.</p><p>There's also an additional Early Purchase bonus that gets you the Hellfrost Warrior and Hellfrost Ninja armor and attire sets if you purchase any physical or digital version of Nioh 3 by February 19, 2026.</p><p>As for digital preorders, you'll get the Early Purchase bonus plus three more in-game items: The Hellfire Warrior Attire set, Hellfire Ninja Attire Set, and the Scampuss Furball Netsuke charm.</p><div title="6535050 -- Nioh 3 Steelbook Launch Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4473" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535050 -- Nioh 3 Steelbook Launch Edition" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Nioh 3 Steelbook Launch Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVBNBRFP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$70 | Releases February 6, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Nioh 3 Steelbook Launch Edition is essentially a boosted standard edition with a special Steelbook case and a few extra pieces of in-game content.

This includes the base game, the Nioh 3 Season Pass--which will unlock two post-launch DLC packs releasing at a later date--and a bunch of in-game accessories and weapons. Here's a look at all the content in the Nioh 3 Digital Deluxe Edition</p><ul><li>Nioh 3 base game</li><li>Nioh 3 Season Pass (unlocks two post-launch DLCs)</li><li>Chijiko Netsuke Charm accessory</li><li>Kodama Netsuke Charm accessory</li><li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li><li>Early Purchase Bonus: Hellfrost Warrior Attire, Hellfrost Ninja Attire (purchase by February 19)</li><li>Digital Preorder Bonus: Hellfire Warrior Attire, Hellfire Ninja Attire, Scampuss Furball Netsuke charm (purchase before February 6)</li></ul><p>Preorders are available on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014010/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> and on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><hr><p>Like the previous entries, Nioh 3 is a fast-paced third-person action RPG that moves quicker than most souls-likes. Playing as Tokugawa--whose appearance is fully customizable--you’ll fight the Yokai plaguing the land in intense combat. The main twist this time is the choice between two distinct combat styles: Samurai or Ninja. With the Samurai style, you can perform a "Ki Pulse" to regain stamina after a combo and build up an Arts Proficiency gauge that unleashes powerful finishing attacks. A new parry system has also been introduced to the gameplay.</p><p>Opting for the Ninja path grants agile, evasive techniques and faster strikes. Instead of weapon stances, you'll wield ninja tools alongside unique abilities. Mist, for instance, creates a clone that distracts enemies, while swift dashes let you slip behind foes for lethal backstabs. Each style has its own gear, but you can switch between them on the fly to adapt in battle. Returning mechanics include guardian spirit transformations, Soul Cores, and Yokai abilities. Set in a “dark samurai world” teeming with sinister spirits, your journey will uncover hidden secrets as you march toward the calamity known as the Crucible.</p><p>If you'd like to catch up on the previous Nioh games, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nioh-Collection-PlayStation-5/dp/B08NX8F4W1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get both of them in a bundle deal</a> for $34.80 (was $70) on PS5. This is a limited-time deal at Amazon, and the Nioh Collection includes remastered and enhanced editions of the 2017 and 2020 games. All of the previously released expansion packs for each game have also been included.</p><h2>Nioh Collection Deal</h2><p>Nioh 3 isn't the only Souls-like action RPG launching in earl 2026. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQTQXD6R,B0FQTK1N9W,B0FQTF7BL6,B0FQTDHNBV&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Code Vein 2</a> will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on January 30, 2026, and it's priced at $70.

                <p>Last year's Fortnitemares was extremely packed with microtransactions, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> item shop averaging a new collab skin every other day over the course of October. And it may be that Fortnitemares 2025 will be even more crowded, with long-rumored collabs with Scream, Friday the 13th, and Scooby-Doo expected to appear in the Fortnite shop during spooky season. But now there's a new rumor about yet another Fortnitemares collab--KPop Demon Hunters.</p><p>The exact nature of the Fortnite x KPOP Demon Hunters collab isn't clear at all right now, since the entire leak is just <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1971637158617534758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HypeX saying</a> that it's "the main Halloween collab" and that it's "not just skins." If true, this would presumably mean that there will be some new KPop Demon Hunters-related gameplay mechanic, like a new weapon or other item. Though since Fortnitemares is also rumored to have a Jason Voorhees medallion and Ghostface's mythic knife, the KPop Demon Hunters collab would have to be even more involved with that.</p><p>The new season of Fortnite Festival begins on October 9, and so it's possible that HUNTR/X will be the new season headliners. Epic previously promised the upcoming Festival season would be focused on Fortnite-original stuff, but that just means they had a plan that would have been very easy to pivot away from if they had the chance to swap in a collab with the biggest Netflix movie ever.</p><p>Fortnitemares 2025 is expected to start in early October, but we don't know for sure when it will be just yet. Even so, there have been plenty of leaks about what we can expect to see from this year's spooky festivities, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">you can read all about them here</a>.</p>
