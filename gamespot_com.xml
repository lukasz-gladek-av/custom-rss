                <p>Between 2021-2023, a former employee at one of game publisher Bandai Namco's subsidiaries allegedly "misappropriated" around 500 million yen (approximately $3.38 million USD), resulting in the employee's arrest and a temporary pay cut for many of the subsidiary's leadership, the company has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">While the arrest happened in January 2024 and Bandai Namco has since been pursuing civil and criminal charges against the former employee, the company is just now able to disclose the incident, according to a <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/HPE794A8_E_BLPHKE9968BE7A4BA.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> outlining the alleged misconduct and the steps Bandai Namco has taken to remedy the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The alleged embezzlement occurred at Bandai Namco's Hong Kong subsidiary Bandai Logipal and was discovered via an internal audit. Following the former employee's arrest, Bandai Logipal took disciplinary actions against many of its leadership in the form of a temporary pay deduction. Four officers and three full-time directors saw a 30% pay deduction for three months starting in April 2024, with two other full-time directors seeing a 15% pay deduction for the same period.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our group takes the occurrence of this incident very seriously and we sincerely and deeply apologize to all our stakeholders for their concerns and the inconvenience caused by such incident," Bandai Namco states. "We will continue our full cooperation with the local law enforcement authorities for the investigation, and we as a group shall work together to prevent the recurrence of such incidents."</p><p dir="ltr">In a step to prevent a similar incident in the future, the Japan-based Bandai Namco is forming a new department to supervise the management of overseas subsidiaries. It notes that the impact of the incident on Bandai Namco's fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 is expected to be minimal.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony recently announced it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">investing $463 million in Bandai Namco</a> as part of a "strategic partnership" that will see it own around 2.5% of the entertainment company. While both company's are well known for video games, in a joint statement, Bandai Namco and Sony said it will "focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."</p>

                <p>The latest update to Nintendo Switch Online's Super Nintendo Entertainment System â€“ Nintendo Classics app includes a new and improved CRT filter to better capture what playing SNES games on an older CRT television was really like.</p><p dir="ltr">While it may seem counterintuitive given how much better TVs are today, new high-definition displays often don't do older games justice visually, as the games were originally designed with the scanlines and interlacing seen in CRT displays in mind.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Super Nintendo app already had a CRT filter, but this new version, added alongside the same update that added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/create-your-own-mario-masterpiece-with-mario-paint-now-on-nintendo-classics-online/1100-6533518/" data-ref-id="1100-6533518">Mario Paint to the service</a>, is a noticeable improvement. According to one user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mccg66/snes_classics_crt_filter_has_been_updated_on_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, it's an "NTSC S-Video" style filter that more accurately displays what playing on an actual CRT is like.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on social media have been posting comparison screenshots between the old and new filter, and the difference is definitely noticeable. One screenshot in particular, posted by a Bluesky user named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smashtoons.com/post/3lv4ytp7xgc2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dalton</a>, helps to highlight the difference, as you can clearly see the much more defined lines that help improve the image when compared to the old filter. You can check out some other comparisons below.</p><p dir="ltr">The new CRT filter is available for the SNES app on both the Switch and Switch 2. While the Nintendo Switch Online N64 and GameCube apps also have CRT filters, it doesn't look like they've received this new version just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-update-has-arrived-and-stability-stans-are-going-to-be-happy/1100-6533520/" data-ref-id="1100-6533520">Switch 2 just received a new hardware update</a> that doesn't appear to do much, but does include "general system stability improvements." Nintendo announced it will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-confirmed-for-july-31/1100-6533543/" data-ref-id="1100-6533543">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase on July 31</a>, which will include information on upcoming Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 games from third-party publishers and developers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The revival of NCAA Basketball from EA Sports aims to feature "all 350 programs" for the sport. At least, that's what EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he'd love to see when talking on a quarterly earnings call earlier this week.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, Wilson was asked about the company's recent announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">a new college basketball game after 16 years since the last one</a>. Like the reveal, Wilson stayed relatively vague with details, though he noted his desire to include every university. "Weâ€™d love to do the same for basketball [as the company does with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football</a>]. All 350 programs, men's and women's teams, the iconic traditions and rivalries, and of course, March Madness," Wilson said.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no set date for when EA's college basketball is set to release, though 2028 was mentioned in <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/memo-ea-sports-looks-to-bring-back-college-basketball-video-games-starting-in-2028-2029-0ef3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a memo obtained by Extra Points</a>. The last game in the series was 2009's NCAA Basketball 10. The sports franchise began in 1998 with NCAA March Madness 98 and only was known as NCAA Basketball for the last two installments.</p><p dir="ltr">There very likely could be competition with EA's return to college basketball, unlike there is for EA Sports College Football. 2K Sports is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-sports-reportedly-planning-college-hoops-standalone-game-not-tied-to-nba-2k/1100-6533301/">reportedly working on a standalone college hoops game</a>, too. However, the return of 2K's College Hoops franchise is apparently aiming to include only 100 programs (men's and women's).</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-we-know-about-eas-first-new-college-basketball-game-in-a-long-time/1100-6533219/">everything we know about EA's new college basketball game</a>.</p>
