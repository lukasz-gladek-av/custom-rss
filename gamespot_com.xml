game.</p><p>Players will even be able to begin earning rewards for MLB 25 as they play through Season 4 with the new Now &amp; Later MLB The Show Packs, with each Now &amp; Later pack able to be redeemed for a regular pack in MLB The Show 25.</p><p>The developer also teased a number of improvements coming in the next installment of the franchise, including deeper player journeys in Road to the Show, new elements of Diamond Dynasty that will replace Sets and Seasons, and improved Franchise trade metrics and offseason play. The gameplay is also set for a bit of a refresh, with MLB 25 expanding on quick-time events, defensive AI, and updated pathing for more engaging gameplay in the moment.</p><p>We can expect to hear more about MLB 25 and what it will be bringing to the franchise in the lead up to its release, which can be expected around the start of the Major League Baseball season in March next year.</p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> officially falls on November 29, plenty of retailers have jumped the gun and are already offering incredible price cuts. That’s especially true of <a href="https://howl.link/pctsffgq35i7b?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322905694352?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Logitech+gaming+mouse&amp;i=black-friday&amp;crid=1P6XJDLHZFEI1&amp;sprefix=logitech+gaming+mouse,black-friday,112&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>--both of which are <strong>slashing prices on a long list of popular Logitech gaming mice</strong>.

That’s just a few bucks shy of its lowest price ever, and its lightweight design and six programmable buttons make it a good companion for most games. With a staggering 250 hours of gameplay on a single AA battery, a total weight of 99 grams, and a Hero Gaming Sensor that supports 400 IPS and up to 12,000 DPI, it’s a pretty great deal.

It's bad news right away, though, as she finds her friend, Safi, lying dead in the snow after being murdered.</p><p>Using her powers, Max creates a parallel timeline in which Safi is still alive, but unfortunately for her, the killer wants her dead in that timeline as well. The hook in Double Exposure is that Max can shift between timelines in an attempt to stop the murders in both timelines.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-an-underdeveloped-picture/1900-6418321/" data-ref-id="1900-6418321">Double Exposure review</a> scored the game a 6/10.
