                <p>Later this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will take players to a distant colony world called Arcadi, where they can shoot their way out of trouble with a new assortment of weapons. According to the game's director, Brandon Adler, Obsidian Entertainment knew the sequel needed to be a significant improvement over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-review-over-the-moon/1900-6417345/" data-ref-id="1900-6417345">The Outer Worlds</a>. To achieve that goal, the team turned to the developers of Halo for advice.</p><p>"We ... talked to the Halo folks," Adler tells <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/25/the-outer-worlds-2-the-most-expensive-xbox-game-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. "They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, 'You guys should target this… you should add that to your weapon configurations.'" Adler also says that Obsidian "did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that [gunplay] felt.'"</p><p>Adler notes that the sequel doesn't have loading screens before entering buildings like its predecessor, and the weapons have been revamped with fresh options and customizable features.</p><p>"We didn't want small changes," continues Adler. "Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose. You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things."</p><p>One of the other changes in the sequel is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-lets-players-choose-between-first-and-third-person/1100-6532273/" data-ref-id="1100-6532273">players can swap from first-person to third-person at will</a>, and decide how they want to experience the game. The Outer Worlds 2 also has the distinction of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-releases-in-october/1100-6532242/" data-ref-id="1100-6532242">the first $80 game for Xbox Series X|S</a>. In a previous interview, Adler said that Obsidian didn't set the price for the game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-director-reacts-to-80-price-says-take-it-up-with-microsoft/1100-6532390/" data-ref-id="1100-6532390">suggested that players should take it up with Microsoft</a> if they have a problem with it.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 29.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3677" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders" data-collection="" title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Outer Worlds 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$80 | Releases October 29</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 standard edition includes the base game on your platform of choice.

                <p>Late last year, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player named Sebastian Araujo alleging that he used cheating software on multiple occasions during tournament play that allowed him to beat players who followed the game's rules. Now, Epic has announced that the court has made a summary judgment in its favor, in part because Araujo never responded to the lawsuit.</p><p>Epic shared the news on social media and noted that the judgment was for $175,000. Additionally, Araujo has been banned from Fortnite for life. Epic also stated that it plans to donate any money it collects to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/site/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Child's Play</a>, a charity that provides sick children in hospitals with toys and games to keep their spirits raised and encourage healing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">THIS JUST IN: The Judge ruled in our favor after the cheater ignored our lawsuit. The player is required to pay $175,000 and we’ll donate what we collect to charity. They are also banned from playing Fortnite forever. <a href="https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4</a></p>  — Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This outcome shouldn't be too surprising, as Epic has aggressively gone after cheaters as well unscrupulous players who sell cheating programs. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/" data-ref-id="1100-6503270">Epic won a sizable amount from an Australian Fortnite cheat maker</a> and donated the settlement to Child's Play. Earlier this year, Epic took action against pro Fortnite player Morgan Bamford aka RepulseGod and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-shows-why-cheaters-never-prosper-after-epic-successfully-sues-pro-player/1100-6529540/" data-ref-id="1100-6529540">banned them from ever taking part in the game's organized tournaments again</a>. Bamford subsequently apologized and returned the prize money to Epic, which once again donated the total to Child's Play.</p><p>Cheaters aren't the only ones who have to fear Epic's legal reprisals. The publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-qa-tester-who-leaked-battle-roy/1100-6460042/" data-ref-id="1100-6460042">sued a game tester in 2018</a> for leaking Battle Royale Season 4 details. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-streamers-for-advertising-cheat/1100-6462540/" data-ref-id="1100-6462540">streamers who touted Fortnite cheats on their live-streams</a> haven't been immune from Epic's wrath. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371"> Epic took a cheat maker and several associates</a> who distributed the software to court in a new lawsuit. The outcome of that case is yet to be decided.</p>

Oddly enough, you're not actually catching these fish. These just mark the area where you'll be reeling in Pals and other in-game items.</p><p dir="ltr">You have the potential to catch both new and existing Pals in the game. To get started, you'll need a fishing rod and some bait. Then, head to the water and cast your line near a school of fish. A minigame will occur once a "fish" takes the bait. This game is similar to fishing in Stardew Valley, where you have a fishing meter and need to keep a green bar near the fish to successfully reel them in.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also catch even more Pals by building and placing fishing ponds inside your base. We'll cover details on the fishing ponds below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808"></a><figcaption>Fishing in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_fishing_rods">How to craft fishing rods</h2><p dir="ltr">There are various fishing rods that you can craft at various levels, and here we'll break down the requirements for each.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Beginner_Fishing_Set">Beginner Fishing Set</h3><p dir="ltr">Available at technology level 15, the beginner fishing set costs 2 points to unlock.

There are several bait types you can use: Simple Bait, High Quality Bait, Deluxe Bait, and Alluring Bait.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Simple_bait">Simple bait</h3><p dir="ltr">Simple Bait is unlocked when you purchase the beginner fishing set. This is the most basic bait type for fishing for Pals. This is a decent starting point for fishing, but it won't be very effective in luring Pals to bite.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Berries</li><li dir="ltr">2 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="High_Quality_Bait">High Quality Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">High Quality Bait is available at technology level 22, and it can be unlocked for 1 point. This bait lures in Pals, and it's improved quality to make catching them more readily.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Tomatoes</li><li dir="ltr">3 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deluxe_Bait">Deluxe Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Deluxe bait is available at technology level 38, and it can be unlocked for 2 points.

This bait has several benefits, as it lures in Pals, improves the minigame, and increases the number of items obtained from earning. This includes Pals and salvage items.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">1 Cavern Mushroom</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrots</li><li dir="ltr">5 Flour</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you've unlocked a bait type, it can then be crafted at the High Quality Workbench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810"></a><figcaption>Fishing pond at base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_fishing_ponds">How to use fishing ponds</h2><p dir="ltr">You can build fishing ponds at your base so your Pals can fish, too. You'll need to craft some bait to place here and assign a Pal to fish for you. Not every Pal can fish, but you should have quite a few options by the time you're high enough level to unlock them. You'll need to assign someone who can use their hands, which means you'll need a handiwork Pal like Anubis, Lyleen, or Katress.</p><p dir="ltr">These ponds have the potential to catch new and existing aquatic Pals, as well as in-game items such as gold and gems. These items can be collected from the cooler sitting next to your fishing Pal.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fishing_pond">Fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">The first Fishing Pond is found at technology level 31, and it can be unlocked for 3 points.</p><p dir="ltr">To build, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">40 Wood</li><li dir="ltr">5 Cement</li><li dir="ltr">10 Pal Fluids</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Large_fishing_pond">Large fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">This larger pond makes it possible to catch even larger Pals than the standard pond.

Just place an aquatic Pal in your party and make sure you've crafted a saddle for them. Use your fishing pole to reel in various items, such as Pal Souls, Gold, and gems.</p><p dir="ltr">Salvage spots in the sea are marked by floating bits of wood and barrels. You'll obviously need a fishing pole equipped, but bait isn't necessary. You simply need to interact with the floating junk to start a minigame. This is different from the fishing minigame, and instead, you'll see a ring that requires you to stop a spinning marker inside a highlighted green area.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld's <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1937709560053285318" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for the update state you can also salvage a new metal from the sea to use in upgrading your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I haven't caught any metal yet.

It's likely a magnet that will pull the new metal type and other high-end items from the sea.</p><p dir="ltr">The Powerful Fishing Magnet is available at technology level 61, and it costs 3 points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following material:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 Hexolite</li></ul><p>For more Palworld guides, make sure to check out how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-change-a-pals-gender-and-passive-skills-in-palworld/1100-6532740/" data-ref-id="1100-6532740">change a Pal's gender and passive skills</a>, how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-transfer-pals-to-different-worlds-in-palworld/1100-6530261/">move Pals to different worlds</a>, and how to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-upgrade-palworld-schematics-to-better-rarities/1100-6530263/"> upgrade your schematics</a>.</p>
