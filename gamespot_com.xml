                <p>Sony has filed a patent document that could potentially allow AI to take over your game for you if you're struggling with it. The documents suggest that this "ghost assistance" can be activated at any time to either guide a player through progression or assume direct control of gameplay.</p><p>As revealed in the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US454147536&amp;_fid=WO2025080356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent documents</a> first filed in September 2024 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), the AI assistance system could potentially play through a section of a game that a player is struggling with, completing it for them. Sony describes the idea of training its AI agent using "footage from many users that have played the game" and various other online sources where gameplay videos have been uploaded.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349"></a><figcaption>An example from Sony, showing how the feature could potentially work.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg"></figure><p>Over the last couple of years, Sony has worked on several features to make its video games more approachable. The PS5 console launched with the Game Help system, which offers helpful tips and tricks via short videos and images on PS5 cards that can be instantly called up during gameplay. While developers haven't widely adopted it, it's still a useful feature for the games that do.</p><p>Sony has also expanded accessibility options for several of its first-party games, while other titles like God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West have been criticized for offering too much assistance to players via protagonist musings or nearby NPCs constantly offering advice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-september-update-expands-ai-assistant-gaming-copilot/1100-6535091/">Microsoft is also experimenting in this space</a> with its own AI-driven assistant. Revealed last year, Gaming Copilot is designed to provide help, recommendations, and other in-game support.</p>

                <p>Asus has hit the Consumer Electronics Show show floor with a brand-new set of Extended Reality glasses. Developed in partnership with Xreal, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 packs an impressive amount of technology into a slim frame for your face, allowing you to stream video directly to your eyes via a USB-C connection.</p><p>Internally, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses, and it comes with an ROG Control Dock for HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity. You can also connect it to an ROG Ally via a single USB-C cable for a seamless experience. Asus says the lenses can create a 57-degree field of view and a 171-inch virtual screen at a distance of four virtual meters, covering 95% of the focused viewing area.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbIIPM7Lsrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbIIPM7Lsrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you'd expect from Asus, these glasses also match the company's Republic of Gamers aesthetic, with RGB lighting on the sides. Weighing just 91 grams, the glasses also have built-in Bose speakers, and electrochromic technology allows the lenses to tint automatically or on demand to suit varying lighting conditions. Pricing has yet to be announced, but Asus aims to launch the glasses in the first half of 2026.</p><p>This is one of several major announcements from Asus at CES 2026. Fans of the ROG gaming laptops can also expect several new models to arrive throughout the year, including a massively updated version of the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo. This new version features <em>two</em> 120Hz OLED HDR 1displays, each 16 inches, and a detachable wireless keyboard.</p>
