                <p>A game industry legend, Rebecca Heineman, has passed away due to cancer on November 17, 2025. She was 62 years old. Friends of Heineman have mourned her across <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media.</a></p><p>Heineman had a prolific career in the game industry that included both game design and high-level competitive play. She won multiple Atari 2600 Space Invaders tournament, including the Atari VCS Space Invaders National Championship held in New York. She became the first national video game tournament champion in the United States.</p><p>"I had two strategies. One was "slow and steady", which won the L.A. tournament, and the other was "kill everything on the screen ASAP," which won me the NYC finals," she said in a 2006 <a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/rebecca_heineman/interview_rebecca_heineman.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "In the finals, I took an hour and 45 minutes to get the highest score. I lost one or two bases because my strategy was riskier, but faster. It paid off and I won."</p><p>Heineman was a founder or co-founder of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül. She worked on hundreds of games, including classics like Dragon Wars and The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate. She also wrote for Electronic Games and worked with major publishers and studios like EA and Sony. Her work touched several major parts of the gaming world.</p><p>Heineman witnessed several changes throughout her time in the game industry, including major innovations in gaming visuals. She recalled how games had become similar to movies, complete with voice actors and scripts. Her approach to game design remained steady, though.</p><p>"The easiest for me is coming up with how to implement a game," she said in 2006. "I always envision in my head what the game should look like on the screen before a line of code is written. Then I design the code to work with that. It allows me to get the game up and running in a very short period of time."</p><p>For more on Rebecca Heineman’s early gaming accomplishments, she was featured in a segment of the Netflix gaming documentary <em>High Score</em>. A GoFundMe is currently underway to assist with funeral arrangements.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Yoko Taro has found success with the Drakengard and Nier franchise(s), but he hasn't had a new game since the Voice of Cards trilogy several years ago. However, the creator of the NieR games insists that he's remained busy in that time, but his games keep getting canceled.</p><p>According to a report on <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Yoko addressed the issue while appearing on a panel at the G-CON 2025 video game convention in Korea. He told the audience that his most recent projects fell apart during development.</p><p>"I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren’t you making a new sequel to Nier' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," said Yoko. "I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released."</p><p>Yoko didn't explain why his projects were canceled or offer any additional details about what they were. He did note that he'd rather see games get canceled than release something that fails to live up to the standards he set with his previous games.</p><p>In 2023, Yoko facetiously said the next Nier game could come out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-says-new-nier-could-come-tomorrow-or-35-years-from-now/1100-6510815/" data-ref-id="1100-6510815">tomorrow or 35 years from now</a>. Nier Reincarnation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-reincarnation-is-shutting-down-but-more-content-is-coming-first/1100-6520531/" data-ref-id="1100-6520531">was shut down in 2024</a>, but Yoko released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nier-tie-in-books-written-by-yoko-taro-releasing-this-month/1100-6521653/" data-ref-id="1100-6521653">two Nier tie-in books</a> that year. Last year, Hiroyuki Kobayashi implied that he's collaborating with Yoko and composer Keiichi Okabe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-is-working-on-new-game-with-nier-producer-and-composer/1100-6523481/" data-ref-id="1100-6523481">on a new project</a>. Earlier in 2025, Yoko shared his prediction that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">AI will put human game developers out of work</a> in 50 years.</p>

This is being done so Embark can focus on current-generation hardware, the studio said, and anyone who wants to keep playing on PS4 will have to migrate to a different, newer console platform, or PC.</p><p>All progress and purchases are connected to Embark ID accounts and will thus transfer to whatever platform people may migrate to. "We're incredibly grateful to everyone who's been part of the PS4 community. See you in the Arena!" the developer said.</p><p>The Finals was never released on Xbox One, so the migration to current-generation platforms doesn't pertain to Xbox. The game is currently available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC, as well as PS4 until March 16.</p><p>The PS4 edition of The Finals launched in December 2024, about a year after the game originally came out for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in December 2023.</p><p>Arc Raiders has sold more than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1oun46w/arc_raiders_is_officially_a_hit_with_over_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4 million copies</a> and remains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's No. 1 best-selling game</a> and one of the platform's most-played games overall.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>
