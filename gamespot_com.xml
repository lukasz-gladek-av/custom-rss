                <p>Recently, Sony confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service game that was in the works at Days Gone developer Bend Studio</a>. A developer at the studio has now responded to the news, thanking fans for the outpouring of support and confirming that the team still wants to make "cool sh**."</p><p>"I'll keep this short," community manager Kevin McAllister <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool sh**."</p><p>Bend's live-service game was never announced, nor was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">supposed live-service God of War game said to be in development at Bluepoint, which was also canceled</a>. Sony confirmed the game cancellations in a statement to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Bloomberg </a>recently, saying the projects were scuttled "following a recent review."</p><p>Back in 2023, Sony management said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">would only go ahead with six live-service games in the near future, down from a dozen.</a> At the time, management said it was attempting to focus on quality over quantity. Plenty of games that begin development are never seen through to release; this is part of the normal creative process.</p><p>But what was <em>not </em>normal was Sony's high-profile shutdown of the multiplayer live-service game Concord and the closure of its developer, Firewalk. Sony pulled the plug on the game just after launch, going on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">refund all players</a>.</p><p>Bend Studio's latest release was 2019's Days Gone, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">unlikely to get a sequel.</a> In June 2024, Bend said the studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">making a new IP</a>, which could have been the canceled live-service game. In the absence of a Days Gone game sequel, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-game-days-gone-moving-forward-with-movie-adaptation-report/1100-6506677/" data-ref-id="1100-6506677">Days Gone biker movie is now in development.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The upcoming Dino Crisis-inspired horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-violet/">Code Violet</a>, will not be coming to PC. Its developers at TeamKill Media say the game will be a PS5 exclusive to prevent modders from modding X-rated dino-based weirdness into their game.</p><p dir="ltr">"For those asking us about a PC version of Code Violet... The reason we are not bringing it to PC is we do not want anyone modding vulgar versions of the main character as well as other characters in the game," TeamKill Media explained in <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent tweet</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kzTotGJJQQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3kzTotGJJQQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But it's not just the game's characters TeamKill aims to protect--the studio said that ensuring their game's voice talent felt safe played a part in the decision, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"We hold our voice actresses and actors with high regard, as well as our artistic vision for the game and story, and reject any form of destroying that with sexual mods," TeamKill wrote. "Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make [on PC]."</p><p dir="ltr">TeamKill hasn't made any comments regarding their stance on fan art, but one can assume that any NSFW Code Violet art won't be met with enthusiasm from the game's creators.</p><p dir="ltr">Code Violet launches on PlayStation 5 sometime in July.
