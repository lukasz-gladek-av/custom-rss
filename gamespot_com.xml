                <p>Movie fans worldwide were shocked to hear of influential filmmaker David Lynch's death this week. Just 78 years old at the time of his passing--he would have turned 79 on January 20--Lynch rose to prominence with films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and the cult-hit TV series Twin Peaks across the '80s and '90s.</p><p>While his strange and surreal approach to filmmaking would inspire several other big names in Hollywood, Lynch also had an impact on video games, with numerous titles having (or claiming to have) a Lynchian feel to their design. One video game series that he has a surprising connection to? Nintendo's Legend of Zelda games, as various key creatives behind the series cited Twin Peaks as a catalyst behind some of the weirder elements in several Zelda games.</p><p>Fittingly, several video game studios and professionals have posted tributes online to Lynch. Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake shared his condolences, as the recent game starring the troubled author is heavily inspired by Lynch's work, with the first game having a heavy Twin Peaks vibe in particular. "The internal codename for Alan Wake 2 was 'Big Fish,'" Lake wrote, referencing Lynch's autobiographical and self-help book. <a href="https://app.bsky.cz/profile/samlakewrites.bsky.social/post/3lfuyhxkjhs2i" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In another post on BlueSky</a>, Lake commented on how Lynch had been a big influence in his life.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> game director Hideo Kojima also said farewell to the film legend with an X/Twitter post. Kojima's work has been heavily influenced by cinema over the years, with his recent Death Stranding games also evoking a weird--but artful--direction that wouldn't look out of place in a Lynch film.</p><p>The Witcher 4 narrative director Phillipp Weber commented on Lynch's passing, praising him for the deep empathy that he had for his characters.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1879974351661068451" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I admired most about David Lynch's work was the deep empathy he had for his characters.<br>It is something that I feel is rare nowadays with a lot of contemporary storytelling.<br>We lost a truly great auteur, and I am sad to exist in a world without him.

On YouTube, his regular weather reports ran for hundreds of videos, he was a celebrated musician, and he was a prolific visual artist.</p><p>"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole,'" Lynch's family wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo did not officially reveal any new games in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Switch 2 announcement this week</a>, but the reveal video might have provided a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/" data-ref-id="1100-6528850">first look at the next Mario Kart game</a>. Intriguingly, too, the video contained references to potential new features and updates to the Mario Kart formula.</p><p>Here's everything we know so far about what could be the next Mario Kart game. For the purposes of this post, we will call the game Mario Kart 9, even though the next game may not be called that.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Mario_Kart_9_be_released_">When will Mario Kart 9 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Mario_Kart_9">Preorder Mario Kart 9</a></li><li><a href="#Mario_Kart_9_trailer_information">Mario Kart 9 trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Mario_Kart_9_new_features">Mario Kart 9 new features</a></li><li><a href="#Mario_Kart_9_platforms">Mario Kart 9 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Mario_Kart_9_characters">Mario Kart 9 characters</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Mario_Kart_9_">Who's developing Mario Kart 9?</a></li><li><a href="#Mario_Kart_9_development_news">Mario Kart 9 development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_Mario_Kart_9_be_released_">When will Mario Kart 9 be released?</h2><p>Nintendo hasn't even announced the next Mario Kart game, so there is no word when it may release. That said, a report said Nintendo was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">preparing Mario Kart 9 to be a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title (as well as a new 3D Mario)</a>.

The trailer was filled with potential clues for the next entry in the long-running series, including the possibility of 24-player races and more. The footage in the Switch 2 trailer of what looks like the next Mario Kart sure looks like a new Mario Kart with little deviation stylistically from Mario Kart 8. If you enjoy Mario Kart, it appears Nintendo is giving us all more of that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4429354-screenshot2025-01-17at8.51.32am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4429354" data-ratio="0.56736938588451" data-width="1091" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4429354-screenshot2025-01-17at8.51.32am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4429354"></a><figcaption>There appear to be 24 starting positions in Mario Kart 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4429354-screenshot2025-01-17at8.51.32am.png"></figure><h2 id="Mario_Kart_9_new_features">Mario Kart 9 new features</h2><p>The supposed Mario Kart 9 trailer contains a number of hints at where the game could go, if it is indeed real. For starters, the video showed a start-line with spaces for 24 racers--this would be double the number of supported racers from Mario Kart 8 (12). Additionally, the video showed a course that appeared to be considerably larger than what we've come to expect from the Mario Kart series, <a href="https://x.com/purroartistico/status/1879995508879684027" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sparking speculation from fans about courses with multiple paths</a> similar to Yoshi's Valley and others.</p><p>Then there was a mysterious glowing item seen in a still, with some believing it could be a brand-new item for the series or potentially connected to a new feature where players have to fuel up their karts. People are theorizing that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/" data-ref-id="1100-6499581">"new twist"</a> in Mario Kart 9 is that karts now have fuel tanks and that players can seek out special items to fuel up and obtain a special boost. None of this is confirmed as of yet, however.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>  — chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Mario_Kart_9_platforms">Mario Kart 9 platforms</h2><p>Mario Kart 9 is expected to be a Switch 2 launch title, and it's expected to be exclusive to that console.</p><h2 id="Mario_Kart_9_characters">Mario Kart 9 characters</h2><p>The Switch 2 announcement video showed off popular characters like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Donkey Kong--sporting what appears to be a new design.

It is far and away the Switch's best-selling game ever, far outpacing the No. 2 game, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has sold 46.45 million copies.</p><p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe embraced a live-service strategy, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-final-dlc-characters-and-first-course-revealed/1100-6517736/" data-ref-id="1100-6517736">releasing 48 courses over time as paid DLC</a>, and it'll be interesting to see how Nintendo embraces post-launch support for Mario Kart 9.

                <p>Bungie has revealed a bunch of new abilities and balance changes that will be released with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next episode, Heresy. The content update will include a brand-new verb, Bolt Charge, for the Arc subclass, as well as three new Aspects that can utilize the verb.</p><p>According to the Abilities team's notes, Bolt Charge was designed to be a powerful damage tool--something that was previously missing from the subclass. Bolt Charge is a stacking buff, which builds up over time to release a bolt of Arc lightning when it reaches its max. Stacks can be built up from multiple sources, and the verb will be integrated with Arc and Prismatic subclass suites.</p><p>"The loop of gaining a Bolt Charge stack, building it up through combat, and then receiving a big payoff ties deeply into the fantasy of Arc’s momentum-based gameplay," Bungie says of the new mechanic, saying it will open up plenty of new build-crafting options for the Arc subclass.</p><p>The update will also bring three new Aspects, which have been designed with Bolt Charge in mind. The first, On The Prowl, is actually a Void Aspect for Nightstalkers, while Storm's Keep and Ionic Sentry are for Arc subclasses Striker Titans and Stormcaller Warlocks respectively.</p><p>Storm's Keep is designed to use Bolt Charge to its highest potential, granting stacks of Bolt Charge to the player and nearby allies under specific circumstances. Ionic Sentry allows Warlocks to charge up a powerful Arc turret, which targets enemies with chain lightning and grants Bolt Charge stacks on kill. On The Prowl is designed to fulfill the fantasy of "hunting down prey and being rewarded for the kill," for Nightstalkers, and is triggered when the Hunter enters invisibility. While On The Prowl is a Void Aspect, Nightstalkers can still build Bolt Charge stacks through other means.</p><p>While the new verb and Aspects are the major new abilities coming with Heresy, the update will also include major balance changes to allow for the new additions and integrate Bolt Charge with existing abilities. The full list of balance changes can be found below.</p><p>Destiny 2 is finishing off its current arc, Revenant, and will be moving into Heresy in February, when the new abilities will be released.</p><h2>Heresy Abilities Update</h2><ul><li>New Arc verb: “Bolt Charge”</li><li>Three new Aspects added</li><li>Heresy ability balance pass</li></ul><h3><strong>On The Prowl</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>On The Prowl</strong><ul><li>Entering invisibility marks a nearby enemy as a priority target for you and your team.  <ul><li>Note: this does not enable players to see marked targets through walls in the Crucible.</li></ul></li><li>Defeating priority targets creates a weakening cloud of smoke that makes you and allies invisible when passing through it.</li><li>When priority targets are defeated, you and nearby allies gain increased weapon reload speed and stability for a short duration and are granted grenade, melee, and class-ability energy.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Storm's Keep</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Storm’s Keep</strong><ul><li>Cast your class ability to grant a moderate number of Bolt Charge stacks to you and nearby allies.
