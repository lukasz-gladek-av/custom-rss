                <p>Earlier this month, NetherRealm Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-gets-the-definitive-edition-treatment-and-its-out-now/1100-6531544/" data-ref-id="1100-6531544">Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition</a>, a digital-only package that includes the base game, the Khaos Reigns DLC expansion, and two rounds of fighter packs. Players took it as a sign that MK1 wouldn't be getting any more updates, and bombarded NetherRealm for continued DLC support. Now, NetherRealm has confirmed that Mortal Kombat 1's reign is coming to a close.</p><p>"We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1," noted the game's official account on <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "And, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020818363924598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later message</a>, NetherRealm acknowledged that fans may be disappointed by the news, before adding that the devs need "to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can."</p><p>NetherRealm hasn't officially announced which game is coming next from the studio, but the most likely choice would be Mortal Kombat 2. DC fighting game fans would probably also like to see NeatherRealm get around to Injustice 3, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/" data-ref-id="1900-6416680">Injustice 2</a> was released eight years ago without getting a proper sequel.</p><p>Earlier this year, NetherRealm added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-adds-a-secret-fight-against-pink-floyd-kind-of/1100-6528939/" data-ref-id="1100-6528939">a pink ninja named Floyd</a> as a hidden battle in Mortal Kombat 1, which may be the final piece of bonus content in the game. Warner Bros. has also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-is-a-list-material-in-new-images/1100-6530158/" data-ref-id="1100-6530158">new images from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie</a>, which will hit theaters on October 24.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Most notably, both the Light and Heavy Bowguns are receiving some substantial buffs, as are the Hammer and Hunting Horn. For the bowguns, various ammo types are seeing a damage increase, as well as an increase to the number of hits when using Dragon Ammo. There are other smaller adjustments too, with the only nerf to come out of the Bowgun changes being a decrease to Elemental Ammo damage.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Hammer and Hunting Horn, both blunt weapons are seeing some major improvements. Hammer is having the "overall" power of its attacks increased, as well as improvements to responsiveness when charging an attack. The hitbox has also been increased for Upswing and sneak attacks. Hunting Horn has seen the damage of some of its key attacks (Echo Bubble, Performance, and Focus Strike: Reverb) increased, as well as a "significant" increase to Encore damage. Capcom has also toned down the visual effects of Echo Bubbles in order to help improve visibility during hunts.</p><p dir="ltr">Those caught up in Monster Hunter Wilds' endgame grind will find more to do soon, as the latest patch makes it so higher-difficulty quests should now appear more frequently as a player's Hunter Rank increases. As detailed in the patch notes, that translates to increased spawn rates for quests with multiple monsters and increased Tempered monster spawn rates. As for monster balance changes, the main change is that monsters resistant to paralysis with now gain more resistance to the ailment each time it's triggered on them, which should make it harder to keep monsters locked down.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the more frequent Tempered monster spawns are five additional Tempered monsters for players to hunt. At Hunter Rank 41 and higher, players can encounter eight star versions of Tempered Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad.</p><p dir="ltr">Fashion Hunters will have more to do as well, with new Hunter and Palico armor sets, outfits for Alma, and additional gestures, pendants, and stickers. Other additions in the patch include the addition of Mandarin Chinese as a language option, the ability to use the rest feature while in tents in Suja and the Grand Hub, and a whole lot of bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds has proven to be a huge success for Capcom. It's currently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025 so far</a>, having sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/" data-ref-id="1100-6530490">10 million copies in its first month</a>, and has helped cement Monster Hunter as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/" data-ref-id="2900-6294">Capcom's best-selling game franchises</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds Patch 1.011.00.00 Notes</h2><h3>Major Additions and Changes</h3><ul><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration is now available.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration side missions have been added.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration Arena Quests have been added.</li><li>– Akuma has been added as an NPC.</li><li>– Akuma-only actions have been added, which can also deal damage to monsters.</li><li>– Five more Tempered Monsters (8★) have been added to the game.

What contributed to the game's big success? No doubt a number of factors, including its lower price and smaller scope, according to publisher Kepler Interactive.</p><p>Kepler's Matthew Handrahan told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Expedition 33 "really respects the player's time;" it's not a game that offers size for the sake of size. "It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay," he said. "It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Becoming A Parry Master In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 In 13 Minutes</p>
      </div>
<p>Handrahan went on to say he believes "brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming," adding that "something can be better by being shorter."</p><p>What he's saying sounds similar to what 2K said about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, which is a $50 linear game that doesn't require a "massive time commitment." 2K has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">believes there is an audience for just such a game</a>, and Expedition 33's sales results thus far may lend credence to that possibility.</p><p>Also in the interview, Handrahan reacted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/" data-ref-id="1100-6531628">rising prices in gaming</a>, saying Expedition 33's $50 price point might have helped the game reach more people. As the price of AAA games goes up and up, it creates an opportunity for "sensibly scoped games" in the $40-$50 range, he said.</p><p>"I don't think anyone that played Expedition 33 would think they didn't get their money's worth out of that," he said. When the $50 price was announced, the company got backlash online, Sandfall COO and producer François Meurisse said, because people feared Expedition 33 might be a 12-hour game with "unfinished content."</p><p><b>"</b>But in the end we stuck with the price, we doubled down on it, [and] we provided some context about the fact that it wasn't a AAA," the developer said. "In the end, it was a win-win situation, because it was a way to attract more players towards the game, to have good player satisfaction about their buying [decision], and it could actually end up doing more sales. So maybe players' perception can change a bit about that kind of price [point]."</p><p>Expedition 33 also launched into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> library--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">the same week as Oblivion Remastered</a>--and some theorized that this might have negatively impacted the number of copies sold outright. Kepler rejected that idea, though, saying launching near Oblivion Remastered didn't seem to hurt "at all."</p><p>Other developers have admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">launching into Game Pass might cannibalize game sales</a>, but any potential losses could be mitigated by a payment from Microsoft to launch on Game Pass. The business specifics of any such deal between Microsoft and Kepler for Expedition 33 are unknown.</p><p>Given the big success of Expedition 33 thus far, many are wondering if Sandfall will release any DLC or expansions for the game, but nothing has been announced. The studio is, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">gearing up for its next game.</a></p>

                <p>Uncapped Games has announced that it is ceasing development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battle-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-631828">Battle Aces</a>, a fast-paced real-time strategy (RTS) spearheaded by a former StarCraft 2 developer.</p><p>This decision was announced on <a href="https://www.playbattleaces.com/news/development-of-battle-aces-has-ended" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle Aces' website</a>. The only real reasoning Uncapped Games provided for the cancellation was that "the returns from early testing were not strong enough to support continued development." In the announcement, Uncapped Games went on to thank the community. "We’ll always be proud of what we built, and the community that formed around Battle Aces," the studio's statement explains. "While the game’s journey ends here, the connections, ideas, and memories we have shared will remain with us forever."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VRoyKP9r8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c0VRoyKP9r8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battle Aces was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">announced at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> by Uncapped Games, a subsidiary of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios. Its game director was David Kim, a designer who worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-30719">StarCraft 2</a> at Blizzard Entertainment, and wanted to make an RTS that stripped back much of the complexity and unit micromanagement common in the genre. Battle Aces matches were short, as players could quickly spawn units and issue simple commands to outflank their enemy and ultimately destroy their base.</p><p>Uncapped Games had held several betas following the announcement of Battle Aces. Invited players had opportunities to try it out in June 2024, November 2024, and April of this year. Although I enjoyed what I played in those betas, after all that public-facing testing, it appears that those behind Battle Aces ultimately determined that it would not be successful enough to launch. For now, there is currently no word on whether Battle Aces' cancellation will result in layoffs at Uncapped Games.</p><p>Those looking for new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">RTS games</a> to carry on StarCraft's legacy will now have to check out the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stormgate/" data-ref-id="5000-565942">Stormgate</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mechabellum/" data-ref-id="5000-511161">Mechabellum</a>, which are backed by former Blizzard developers.

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest has not been as ubiquitous as Final Fantasy in recent years, but the two series are intertwined in the history of defining and formalizing Japanese RPGs. And just as the Pixel Remaster remakes of Final Fantasy have given players a fresh and modernized way to reexperience history, Dragon Quest is aiming to give players a dose of history with the Erdrick Trilogy--the first three Dragon Quest games, remastered across two packages. Dragon Quest 3 was a treat, and now DQ1+2 will round out the set with Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake. Despite my affection for retro RPGs, early Dragon Quest is a relative blind spot for me, and after a little hands-on time I'm eager to play each of them to completion.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, the games are a stunning marriage of classic pixel art and modern touches. I hadn't realized how much better Square Enix's "HD-2D" aesthetic had become in recent years. My impression from the Octopath Traveler games and the tactics game Triangle Strategy was still that HD-2D tends to be fairly muted and muddy. As much as I enjoyed those games, the art style didn't wow me. Dragon Quest 1+2, on the other hand, applies the structure of HD-2D to a much more vibrant world. The color palette and saturation feels reminiscent of 8-bit classics, which makes the beautiful sprite artwork pop.</p><p dir="ltr">This package includes both the first and second Dragon Quest games, which are rudimentary by today's standards, but that's also what makes them so endearing. The very first Dragon Quest game was a very early blueprint for the series, featuring just one hero character taking on the legions of slimes and monsters to overcome evil. The second game is a bit more reminiscent of early Final Fantasy games, with party members that come and go as the story demands. Even then, though, the options were set by default to give you direct control over the main hero and let the other party members move autonomously.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4501980" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4501980"></a><figcaption>A battle in Dragon Quest 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4501971,1300-4501972,1300-4501973,1300-4501974,1300-4501975,1300-4501976,1300-4501977,1300-4501978,1300-4501979" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I got the impression from my preview session that these two games are packaged together because they're each comparatively limited in scope. But together with Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which was released last year, they represent a "trilogy" of the original Dragon Quest games. DQ3 is a prequel to the other two, so Square Enix decided to release them in chronological story order. But arranged in the original order--1, 2, 3--they represent a closer look at the evolution of early RPGs. First a lone hero, then a nomadic party, and finally a customizable party with job classes. Square Enix said it has also added an epilogue to the end of DQ1+2 that neatly ties the trilogy together.</p><p dir="ltr">I only played a couple of early areas in both games, which means I didn't have much opportunity for more complex strategies and managing equipment. But Square Enix seems to understand that some of the battles, especially the simpler ones at the outset, need a fast-forward function to make battles more light and breezy. You can swap middle-battle, so it's worth slowing down to see the charming animations of the enemy attacks once or twice, but after that there's no harm in making everything move a bit faster.</p><p dir="ltr">The story also leans into the olde English style of translation, and from my limited time it seemed more pronounced than I remember in the DQ3 remake. It feels a little goofy, but it's tongue-in-cheek, so after a little adjustment I enjoyed it.</p><p dir="ltr">And what makes Dragon Quest feel so special--forgive me for being late to the party on this, Dragon Quest fans--is its sense of character. Everything from the score to the enemy designs feels at once grand in scope and adorably bubbly and chipper. The enemy designs especially, presented in first-person in DQ, have a comical sensibility. It just makes a fun world to live and adventure in, and I can't wait to continue on and finish the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2 on October 30.</p>

<p>Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">defended the choice to put Ciri in the lead</a> and denounced the idea that doing so was "woke."</p><p>"There's nothing woke about it," said Cockle. "[Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome... If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue. There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>Sebastian Kalemba, the director of The Witcher 4, has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/" data-ref-id="1100-6528580">there will be romance in the game</a>, and indicated a desire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-wants-players-to-feel-the-rewards-for-their-choices/1100-6531667/" data-ref-id="1100-6531667">players to feel rewarded</a> for their choices as Ciri. Kalemba has also previously stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">the events depicted in the trailer may unfold differently</a> depending upon choices made by the player.</p><p>While The Witcher 4 remains in development without a release date in the immediate future, the Xbox Store is now selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-celebrates-the-witcher-3s-10th-anniversary-with-limited-edition-controller/1100-6531746/" data-ref-id="1100-6531746">The Witcher Special Edition Xbox Controller</a> to celebrate the 10th anniversary of The Witcher 3.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Plus the team has grown up, has acquired new skills throughout production," said Meurisse. "Many of them were junior when we started. We learned to work together.
