          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 26 Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>EA has also made some changes to the game's ranked competitive Road to the College Football Playoffs mode, to make the experience feel more competitive and reward skilled play. All players will now earn more Rank Points overall, especially in lower divisions, which will be balanced by a lower starting rank. Some players may find their ranks moved down as a result of the update. EA is also making improvements to playoff qualifications to reward strong performance, as well as making win modifiers like Away wins or lower-tier victories more significant.</p><p>Alongside the many gameplay updates, fixes, and improvements, CFB26 will also get some updates to the aesthetics and feel of the game. There are over 30 new additions in equipment and uniforms, including some teams' new season uniforms that didn't make it in in time for the game's launch. As the video game evolves to match the real college football season, EA is also adding over 50 new audio commentary intros for rivalry games, covering some of the 2025 season's most anticipated matchups.</p><p>As a last little bonus in this title update, CFB26 is getting a handful of new marching band pop covers, including contemporary pop hits like Apple and Espresso, as well as some older favorites including Misery Business and Get Lucky.</p><p>Check out everything that's new, changed, and fixed in the September 11 College Football 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/campus-huddle-title-update-september-11th?utm_campaign=cf26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb26-title-update-4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=86084&amp;ts=1757570124033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">title update</a> below:</p><h2>College Football 26 Title Update September 11th</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Pass Blocking &amp; Pass Rush</h3><ul><li>Added option to set Base Protection by default.</li><li><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> <em>For players who don’t want built-in pass protections on passing plays, we have included a new Coaching Adjustment to allow players to elect Base Protection as the default protection for all dropback passing plays.

This prevents scenarios where players could reach the playoffs with a losing record in lower divisions.</li><li><strong>Division Rank Adjustments:</strong> If you’re currently in one of the affected divisions, your rank may be moved down to reflect the new starting points until you begin your next season.</li><li><strong>Improved Playoff Qualification:</strong> These changes ensure that strong performance is rewarded, especially in higher divisions. Previously, playing mostly Tier 1 matchups could make it difficult to reach the playoffs even with a great record.</li><li><strong>Win Modifiers Matter More:</strong> The base Rank Points for a win are increased, making modifiers like Away wins or victories as a lower tier team even more valuable.</li><li><strong>No Change to Win Requirements:</strong> The number of wins needed to move up or stay in a division remains the same.</li><li><strong>More Time to Compete:</strong> Based on player feedback, we are making all RTCFP games 4 minutes a quarter vs 3 minutes so that you have enough time to overcome Home Field Advantage.</li></ul><h2>Why Are We Making These Changes?</h2><p>Our goal is to make playoff qualification more competitive and rewarding, while ensuring that every win counts—especially in tougher matchups. These updates will help create a more balanced and exciting Road to the College Football Playoffs experience.</p><h2>Presentation</h2><h3>Equipment</h3><p><strong>New Equipment Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>6 New Axiom Masks</li><li>Adidas Ultra Boost Mono Cleats</li><li>Adidas Adizero Electric 2 Exotic Speed Cleats</li></ul><p><strong>New Uniforms &amp; Uniform Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>Air Force Space Force Alternate Uniform</li><li>Central Michigan University Sleeve Numbers</li><li>East Carolina University Purple Fleck Helmet</li><li>Florida International University Vice City 2023 Uniform</li><li>Fresno State Camouflage Helmet</li><li>Fresno State White USA Helmet</li><li>Mississippi State 2023 Throwback Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State Black Alternate Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State White Interlocking Helmet</li><li>Old Dominion University Blue Helmet</li><li>Oregon State Camouflage Uniform</li><li>Sam Houston State Home Jersey</li><li>San Diego State University New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of Alabama at Birmingham New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of California Paw Print Helmets</li><li>University of Kansas Blue Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Kansas White Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Louisiana at Monroe Black Alternate Helmet</li><li>University of Nebraska Black Uniforms</li><li>University of Nebraska Blackshirts (2020) Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico Red Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of New Mexico Turquoise Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico White Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of Virginia Stars and Stripes Helmet</li><li>University of Washington 2022 White and Gold Set</li><li>University of Washington Throwback Uniform</li><li>Western Michigan Bumpers</li><li>Names now appear on the New Mexico State University Crimson, Black, and White Jerseys</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed the Pop Song Covers that were part of our original launch.

                <p>One of the hardest fights in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> has been between the developer and the cheaters. Activision has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-issues-an-extreme-warning-to-cheaters/1100-6530183/" data-ref-id="1100-6530183">warned cheaters in the recent past</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/" data-ref-id="1100-6530471">ramped up its response to the issue</a> as well. Now, the publisher is taking a bow by demonstrating how some of the latest anti-cheat measures have been implemented in the game.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05-reloaded" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of the Duty's official site</a>, Activision cited its in-game mitigations that disrupt cheaters in matches by making their weapons disappear or blowing up their cars. "They then promptly tell on themselves across social media, asking 'Why did this happen?'"</p><p>"These are our mitigations at work, ramped up and powered by new detection systems that have been extremely effective at disrupting bad actors in real-time," continued the developer. "We don't hit every cheater with these mitigations; most are banned upon detection. But in August alone, over 55,000 cheaters were disrupted by Call of Duty's mitigations."</p><p>After nerfing cheaters in action, the developer collects info about the users and permanently ban them. The post also touched upon the RICOCHET anti-cheat tools that are being tested during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">the Black Ops 7 beta</a>. However, "the full force of our protections will be reserved for launch, when all systems come online together."</p><p>Black Ops 7 is coming to consoles and PC on November 14, but there has been some controversy about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">skins from Black Ops 6 not carrying over</a> to the new game. Activision has since stated that a small handful of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/" data-ref-id="1100-6534614">zombie skins and operators will be available</a> in Black Ops 7.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>College football players who lent their names and likenesses to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">EA Sports College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football 26</a> reportedly received a pay bump from $600 to $1,500 per player. However, that may not be enough for players when EA begins putting together the deals for College Football 27.</p><p>According to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/group-that-facilitated-nil-deal-for-football-video-game-now-says-its-not-enough/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Front Office Sports</a>, the issue at hand is revenue sharing. EA's Madden NFL and other pro sports games include players when dividing the revenue. However, EA's deal for the College Football games only included extra payments if the athletes appeared on the cover or if they were involved with the marketing of the game.</p><p>FOS notes that EA also left out the language in the contract that allowed college players to opt out of the deal, but the company told Front Office Sports that players can still do so if they contact EA directly. OneTeam Partners--the organization that worked with EA to line up the college players--has shared a statement calling for revenue sharing in the next installment of the series.</p><p>"OneTeam does not dictate the terms of the NIL agreements between college players and EA," a OneTeam spokesperson told FOS. "The decision to remain silent on the opt-out was EA's unilateral choice. We continue to work with EA to influence its NIL License agreement, but these changes were implemented by EA ... The higher payouts in this year's title show the progress, but it's not enough. We continue to advocate for meaningful revenue sharing for college athletes from all partners."</p><p>Earlier this year, Pathway Sports and Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">reached out to college players directly</a> for their name, image, and likeness rights for $1,500, which was the rate EA reportedly ended up paying for College Football 26. Since there isn't a union for college athletes, neither OneTeam nor Pathway Sports can negotiate deals on behalf of all college players.</p><p>The report adds that OneTeam objected to EA's terms for this year's College Football 26, but was contractually obligated to present those deals to the athletes as written. Without a union in their corner, college football players may not have the leverage to get revenue sharing from EA in the immediate future.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
