                <p>When Mushy relogged onto her Animal Crossing: New Horizons island after years away, she expected the weeds, cockroaches, and angry villagers. She didn't expect a blast from the past when she checked in on her ex-partner's room, which was designed like a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pxaxut/forgot_my_ex_made_his_home_into_a_jail_sell_over/" rel="nofollow ">jail cell.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"He had a weird sense of humor and once he saw that there were jail items in the game--jail bars, wallpaper, toilets-- he thought it would be hilarious to turn his island home into a jail cell," she told GameSpot. "I helped him gather the items too."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons – 3.0 Update and Switch 2 Edition Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">She hadn't remembered helping him after New Horizons launched in March 2020, but everything came rushing back when she logged on for the first time to prepare for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/animal-crossing-new-horizons-everything-new-in-update-3-0/2900-7399/" data-ref-id="2900-7399">3.0 update</a> coming on January 15.</p><p dir="ltr">"After a little roaming around I came upon my ex's old island home and I remembered how it was decorated. This was extra hilarious and ironic since a few months after our break up, he ended up in jail in real life and is still there to this day," Mushy said with a laugh. "So, all in all, my ex manifested his future in jail on my Animal Crossing island."</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn't reset when you stop playing. It doesn't erase past decisions or smooth over absences. Instead, it waits. Returning years later means confronting creative choices, emotional baggage, and memories left exactly where they were. As players log back in ahead of the January 15 update, many are realizing their islands have been holding onto more than furniture layouts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819" data-ratio="0.56203703703704" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819"></a><figcaption>Mushy hadn't visited her island in 3 years and 7 months | Credit: Mushy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players who stepped away years ago are reopening save files and running headfirst into the past. They're pulling weeds and repairing relationships with villagers, but they're also revisiting islands built during the pandemic and the years that followed. These spaces function as digital time capsules, preserving routines and aesthetics from a period when Animal Crossing felt essential.</p><p dir="ltr">For many players, Animal Crossing wasn't just a game during 2020 and 2021--it was a coping mechanism as the COVID-19 pandemic raged. Islands were structured around daily check-ins, online meetups, and familiar rituals when the outside world felt unstable. Logging back in now means rediscovering those habits without the context that made them necessary. Bulletin boards still display old messages. Homes remain decorated for long-passed events. Villagers comment on absences measured in years.</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing makes time visible in a way few games do. Villagers acknowledge your absence. Weeds accumulate. Neglect leaves a mark. That design choice turns returning into something more personal than simple nostalgia. It's not just about remembering how things were--it's about seeing proof that time moved forward without you.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, Animal Crossing: New Horizons never truly went dormant. A dedicated community has continued to play daily, decorating seasonally and maintaining relationships with villagers they've known for years. For those players, the January update isn't a return--it's just the next step.</p><p dir="ltr">That divide became especially visible at the start of 2026. While some players were reopening old islands, others rang in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-years-eve-games/2900-7374/" data-ref-id="2900-7374">new year</a> standing in their town square, counting down the final seconds with their villagers. Screenshots of midnight celebrations spread online, showing islands that never stopped evolving. For these players, Animal Crossing remains part of their daily routine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885"></a><figcaption>Players are revisiting their custom landmarks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The upcoming update has brought both groups back into the same conversation. Lapsed players are cautiously reopening save files. Everyday players are preparing their islands for new content. Both are engaging with the game from very different emotional places, shaped by how long they've been away.</p><p dir="ltr">For some, returning has been especially difficult. Over the years, players have used Animal Crossing to build <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-players-are-remembering-loved-ones-in-game/1100-6482592/">memorials</a>, preserve important moments, and create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/letters-and-flowers-how-games-memorialize-loved-on/1100-6473761/#comments-block-33482638">spaces tied to people they've lost</a>. Revisiting those areas ahead of the update has been both painful and meaningful. Gardens remain untouched. Homes stay frozen in time. The game offers no prompt to move on--only the option to continue.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what makes this wave of returns feel significant. Animal Crossing isn't just drawing players back with new features, and these islands aren't just neglected towns--they're records of who players were when they last logged off.</p><p dir="ltr">As January 15 approaches, players are reopening digital spaces filled with memory, grief, comfort, and growth. And in doing so, they're discovering that Animal Crossing didn't just wait for them to come back--it remembered everything.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fable Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>When Forza Horizon 6 was announced in 2025, Microsoft said it would come to PS5 after the Xbox and PC releases, but the company did not say what the exact gap would be. As for Fable, there is no word yet at all about a PS5 release, but it would be little surprise, given the belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">Microsoft will release all of its big games on PS5.</a></p><p>When Fable was delayed to 2026, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delay-into-2026-could-allow-it-to-release-on-ps5-at-launch-leaker-suggests/1100-6529719/" data-ref-id="1100-6529719">the delay could allow the game to release on PS5 alongside the Xbox and PC versions.</a></p><p>Fable and Forza Horizon 6 will be shown off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">Xbox Developer Direct on January 22</a>. During the showcase, Playground will provide an "extended look" at Fable, which is notable because Microsoft has shown so little so far. Forza Horizon 6, meanwhile, will get a debut of the first gameplay footage.</p><p>Microsoft puts some of its games on rival systems like PS5 to help them reach more people, and to bring in more money. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-xbox-game-just-passed-300-million-in-revenue-on-ps5-report-says/1100-6537323/" data-ref-id="1100-6537323">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5 passed 5 million units sold and $300 million in revenue.</a></p>

                <p>Nexon has officially announced that Arc Raiders has sold more than 12.4 million units since the $40 game launched at the end of October 2025.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The Korean publisher, which owns the Arc Raiders IP and developer Embark, further stated that Arc Raiders passed 10 million units sold by the end of December 2025. Nexon said sales accelerated recently, presumably due in part to the game's 20% discount, pushing total figures to 12.4 million and counting. The game has sold well and still has lots of players, as the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-were-the-top-15-most-popular-games-last-week-in-the-us/2900-7295/" data-ref-id="2900-7295"> regularly ranks at the top, or near it, on the Steam charts.</a></p><p>Anyone who logs into Arc Raiders by the end of today, January 13, will get the "Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool" as part of the game's new update today.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592"></a><figcaption>Get the Gilded Pickaxe for free right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg"></figure><p>This update makes a series of significant changes, including reducing the fire rate for the Kettle from 600 to 450. "The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using third-party software," Embark said.</p><p>Additionally, the Trigger 'Nade has been nerfed. "This nerf aims to make it less usable as a 'trigger-in-air' grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb," Embark said</p><p>What's more, the new Arc Raiders update fixes an exploit with key cards that allowed players to retain the room keys even after using them.</p><p>Given the huge success of Arc Raiders so far, it's no big surprise that Hollywood has come calling. Embark has said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">gotten TV and movie pitches</a>, but no deals have materialized as of yet.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been big hit, but it's also been criticized for its use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-my-game-of-the-year-but-its-use-of-generative-ai-really-sucks/1100-6537140/" data-ref-id="1100-6537140">AI-based text-to-speech systems</a>. Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, recently shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is to make better games more efficiently. He also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark.</p><p>"We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors," Söderlund told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a>. "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/" data-ref-id="1900-6418435">Arc Raiders review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played," reviewer Mark Delaney said.</p>

                <p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has clarified his statements regarding X's AI generation of nonconsensual sexual images of minors and women, saying he merely "criticized a government official" for pressuring publicly traded companies for attempting to "block a speech app owned by their political opponent."</p><p>Right around the January 9 weekend, news broke that X users were turning to Grok, the platform's AI tool, to <a href="https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create images of minors and women</a> in sexually compromising outfits and positions. The situation drew the attention of US Senators Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Edward Markey (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), who <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_apple_and_google_on_removing_x_and_grok_from_app_store_192026pdf.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote a letter to Apple and Google</a> requesting that the companies remove the Grok and X apps from their app stores for the "mass generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of women and children." The senators have asked for a written response from both companies by January 23.</p><p>In response to the letter, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MacRumors reported and shared on X</a>, Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009732745140871463" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quoted the post on January 9 and said</a> that senators using their political power to remove these apps for the harm they have caused are "gatekeepers" who are trying to "censor all of their political opponents." He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009753835456156088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued in a follow-up post</a>, explaining that no major AI company is "perfect" because they all have "documented instances of [their tech] going off the rails" and that these companies "make their best efforts to combat this." These comments blew up, drawing criticism from some corners of Elon Musk's social platform and praise from others.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer ran a story on January 11</a> criticizing Sweeney for what it described as a defense of "an unprecedented online sexual humiliation machine," Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the outlet's reporting</a>, calling the story a "vile lie" that misconstrued his statements.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is a vile lie by PC Gamer.

Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010523813205717499" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded</a>, suggesting there might be "some group chat somewhere" of people plotting who to attack, when to attack, and why to attack. He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010498148263776673" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">believes that the story PC Gamer ran</a> was an "absolutely disgusting disregard for the truth and for editorial practices."</p><p>GameSpot reached out to Epic for comment but has not yet received one.</p><p>While Sweeney appears frustrated with PC Gamer's framing of his comments, he also clarified that X's Grok generating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other nonconsensual sexually exploitative images is "bad." He also reiterated his position that "every significant AI has instances of this" and that companies "make their best efforts to stop it," but all are "imperfect."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009751797393502548" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1) That is bad.<br>2) Every significant AI has instances of this.<br>3) Every significant AI company makes their best efforts to stop it.<br>4) All are imperfect.<br>Thus the combined danger of selective enforcement against political opponents, and distribution monopolies.</p>  — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009751797393502548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>According to the <a href="https://rainn.org/get-the-facts-about-csam-child-sexual-abuse-material/what-is-csam/" rel="nofollow ">Rape, Abuse, &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a>, CSAM (pronounced “see-sam”) refers to "any visual content--photos, videos, livestreams, or AI-generated images--that shows a child being sexually abused or exploited."
