                <p>The biggest gaming announcement this week came from Valve when it revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">six-inch Steam Machine</a>, a new device coming in 2026 that will allow people to play PC games on their TV. Some have seen this as Valve attempting to enter the living room marketplace currently dominated by the mainstay platform-holders like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. But Valve apparently doesn't pay too much attention to existing consoles and instead came up with the idea for the Steam Machine by looking at the latest trends in PC gaming.</p><p>Software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that when Valve was setting out to create the Steam Machine, the company was "not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At the same time, he admitted that there ended up being "quite a bit of overlap" because the Steam Machine aims to make PC gaming "work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been."</p><p>"But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed," Griffais said. "But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general."</p><p>Rumors have suggested that Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console could take the form of a more PC-like system. In any event, Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said the company considers the Steam Machine to be a PC and not a traditional gaming console.</p><p>"The Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that," he said. "We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically."</p><p>The Steam Machine, along with Valve's new Steam Frame VR device and the next Steam controller, will launch in 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">Steam Machine pricing</a> has not been disclosed as of yet for any of the new devices, however. On the subject of pricing for the Steam Machine, Valve said it wants the system to be "affordable," but that doesn't tell us much. One analyst, Rhys Elliott, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">the "sweet spot" would be $400.</a></p><p>The Steam Machine runs the Linux-based SteamOS, similar to the Steam Deck, making the Steam Machine similar to the Steam Deck in a console form factor.</p>

                <p>Microsoft bought Minecraft and developer Mojang in 2014 for $2.5 billion, but the Xbox company was not the only group to make an offer for the sandbox series. It was reported years ago that Activision (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-ea-tried-to-buy-minecraft-report/1100-6425648/" data-ref-id="1100-6425648">as well as EA</a>) was also in the mix to buy Minecraft, and now former executive Bobby Kotick has discussed the bid process and what ultimately kept the deal from coming together. </p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://x.com/RUSHMOREonX/status/1988226452484243626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billionaire Ari Emanuel's podcast</a>, Kotick said of Minecraft, "I almost bought it."</p><p>He added: "I had to spend five days in Stockholm with [Markus 'Notch' Persson], the guy who founded the company. We offered him $1.5 billion. And he said, 'By the way, I'm quitting, and my top leadership guys are all quitting.' And they only had 30 employees at the company. Like, we can't run your company."</p><p>Persson called Kotick back at some point and told him that Microsoft came to him with an offer of $2.5 billion, a price that was presumably too steep for Activision. "I said, 'I'll go airplane shopping with you, but you gotta take that offer,'" he said.</p><p>Kotick went on to say that it was Xbox executive Phil Spencer who ultimately got the deal done for Minecraft. He also singled out another Xbox executive, Matt Booty, who "did a really great job" at managing the Minecraft business after Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang.</p><p>In the end, Minecraft did end up in the Activision family by way of Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, but that came later.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/minecraft-book-excerpt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported in 2015</a> about the inner workings of the deal Microsoft made for Minecraft. There were apparently fears that Mojang's relatively small staff at the time would simply leave after the sale to Microsoft went through. After all, at the time, only Persson, Jakob Porser, and Carl Manneh were shareholders.</p><p>Microsoft reportedly incentivized workers to stay, offering each one who remained for at least six months a payment of 2 million Swedish Krona, which is about $300,000 USD. Another part of the deal was that every employee was guaranteed their monthly salary for 24 months, even if Microsoft closed the Mojang office in Stockholm.</p><p>Minecraft continued to succeed after Microsoft's purchase of the game and studio, and today, Minecraft remains one of the top five best-selling games ever with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 300 million units sold.</a> Instead of releasing Minecraft 2, Mojang has updated and improved the game over time. There have been spin-offs, too, including Minecraft Earth, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends--but these games did not reach anywhere near the success of the original Minecraft. Outside of games, a film--A Minecraft Movie--was released in 2025 and earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">more than $950 million globally</a>. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">sequel is now coming in 2027.</a></p><p>As for Kotick, he left Activision Blizzard after selling the company to Microsoft for $75.4 billion.</p>
