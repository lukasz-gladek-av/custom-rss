                <p>Nvidia's new 50-series graphics cards just aren't as good at running certain older games as previous hardware generations were, some PC gamers have discovered. With its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX, a physics simulation technology that was used in a number of popular titles in the early 2010s.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/rtx_50_series_silently_removed_32bit_physx_support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, one user questioned why PhysX was suddenly turned off by default, or when turned on was forced to run on the CPU--causing major performance issues in games designed for GPU-enhanced PhysX. Responding to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557200/geforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325/3501715/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the Nvidia forums</a>, the company confirmed that PhysX has effectively been discontinued, due to Nvidia ending support for 32-bit CUDA applications for 50-series graphics cards and future generations. While the end of support for 32-bit CUDA was noted in a <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/~/support-plan-for-32-bit-cuda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brief support article</a>, Nvidia never explicitly mentioned the impact to PhysX, or noted which games might be impacted with the sunsetting of this technology.</p><p>PhysX's GPU-accelerated physics tech was acquired by Nvidia in 2008, and its realistic simulation of moving cloth, liquids, smoke and fog, and shatter particle effects was implemented in a number of popular AAA games of the time--including Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, the Batman: Arkham trilogy, and the first two Metro games.</p><p>While PhysX is now mostly defunct and hasn't been implemented in new games for some time, many gamers were still disappointed to discover it had been discontinued without warning. Users on the Resetera forums have since banded together to create a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of games</a> that will be impacted by the end of PhysX support. The list also notes how well each game will run when using the CPU for PhysX, with users testing each game individually. The full list includes a little under 50 games, but include some popular titles from the period between 2007-2014.</p><p>Previous Nvidia generations, including the 40-, 30-, and 20- series will continue to support 32-bit CUDA applications, meaning gamers who play a lot of older games may be better to stick to an older graphics card for the time being. As is standard for a new generation of graphics cards, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-where-to-buy-new-nvidia-gpu/1100-6528684/" data-ref-id="1100-6528684">new 50-series GPUs</a> are pretty hard to find at the moment, anyway.</p>

                <p>Author George R.R. Martin, who was involved in coming up with some of the lore of From Software's Elden Ring, has commented on the possibility of the game becoming a movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-reveals-there-is-some-talk-about-making-a-movie-out-of-elden-ring-but-theres-one-big-obvious-thing-that-could-limit-his-involvement-with-it-ign-fan-fest-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Martin said he "can't say too much about it," but did indeed confirm that there is "some talk about about making a movie out of Elden Ring."</p><p>In Hollywood, nothing is certain, so no one should get their hopes up to see an Elden Ring movie soon, or ever. Martin acknowledged this, saying "we'll see" if the movie "comes to pass." Even if an Elden Ring movie does materialize, Martin said he's not sure what the extent of his involvement could be. "I don't know," he said, before going on to acknowledge that he's "a few years behind" on his long-awaited Winds of Winter. "So that limits the amount of things that I can do," he said.</p><p>Before this, From Software's own Hidetaka Miyazaki said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">"some interest" in an Elden Ring movie, but the team wants to be careful about finding the right partner for it. </a></p><p>Back in 2021, Bandai Namco said Elden Ring was already being developed for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">"variety of other areas,"</a> and many took this to mean some kind of film or TV adaptation. Nothing has materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Elden Ring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-rapidly-catching-up-to-dark-souls-sales/1100-6528496/" data-ref-id="1100-6528496">sold nearly 30 million copies</a> to rank as one of the best-selling RPGs ever. Given the immense commercial success of the game, along with Martin's involvement, it's no surprise to hear Hollywood studios might be interested in trying to adapt it. Next up for the game is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Nightreign</a> standalone co-op spinoff, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">launches this May.</a></p><p>It's still early days for a potential Elden Ring movie, and there is no word yet on if it's animated or live-action, or who may direct and star in it. As for confirmed releases, the next two video game movies on tap are A Minecraft Movie (April 4) and Until Dawn (April 25).</p><p>Check out the gallery below to see some of the other video game movies in the works now.</p>

                <p>A couple of years ago, the idea of PlayStation-exclusive games being ported to PC would have seemed highly unlikely, but times have changed. Insomniac's Spider-Man games, Housemarque's Returnal, and the Horizon series are just a few of the big PlayStation properties that have recently made their way to PC since 2020, and former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida recently spoke about how doing so was almost like having a license to print money.</p><p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles--especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," Yoshida said in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money" rel="nofollow ">Push Square</a>). "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation. It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title. So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p><p>The benefit to Sony's push into PC gaming is that it has also allowed it to reach very lucrative markets like China, where PCs are far more popular than consoles. "China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience," Yoshida added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/">Sony's next PC port will be The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which comes shortly after the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 earlier this year. Yoshida has participated in several interviews since he bid farewell to Sony in January, a company he worked at for 38 years. Starting in 2019, Yoshida was put in charge of a new indies initiative for Sony, a position <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/">that he says he had no choice to accept at the time</a> as it was either that or he would have been forced to leave the company.</p><p>Yoshida has also spoken candidly about how he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/">attempted to "resist" the push into live-service games</a> had he still been SIE president and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/">why there is no Bloodborne remaster</a> yet.</p>
