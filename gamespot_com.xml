                <p>If you're working your way through Stella Montis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, you may have the Snap and Salvage quest. This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.</p><p>Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.</p><p>Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_rovers_in_the_Sandbox_and_how_to_take_a_photo_of_them">Where to find the rovers in the Sandbox and how to take a photo of them</h2><p>To take a photo of the rovers in the Sandbox, you'll need to make your way to (surprise!) the Sandbox POI on the bottom layer of the map. This location is found in the center of the map and is easy to access, but it's worth noting that it's a fairly exposed area. As such, try to get in and get out while staying on the lookout for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594" data-ratio="0.56306760847629" data-width="1982" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594"></a><figcaption>Here's where to find the rovers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you reach the lower area in the Sandbox where there is a lot of sand (surprise again!), you'll spot some rovers in plain sight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595"></a><figcaption>Take a photo of a rover to complete this part of the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you arrive, you can simply walk up to a rover to get a yellow prompt allowing you to photograph it.

These items are random drops throughout Stella Montis, meaning you'll need to thoroughly investigate drawers, lockers, breaches, and more to round them up.</p><p>However, since the tooltip on both items state that they're most commonly found in Exodus locations, you'll want to prioritize looting in areas with that specification, such as the Assembly POI.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602604-share_20251114_0646270.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602604" data-ratio="0.56470177886292" data-width="2867" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602604-share_20251114_0646270.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602604"></a><figcaption>The Assembly POI is specified as having Exodus loot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602604-share_20251114_0646270.jpeg"></figure><p>Loot anything and everything here, then extract and reset to try again as needed. We didn't have too much trouble finding these items while looting randomly throughout the map during our first few runs. Hopefully, they have a relatively high spawn rate so that you, too, can get your Snap and Salvage quest finished up.</p><p>Just remember to toss these items into a safe pocket in case things get hairy, then head back to Speranza at the nearest extraction point when you're ready to get out. We'd hate to see you put in all that time for nothing, raider.</p><p>For more on, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas.</p><p>"They were the only choice," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/crawl-out-through-the-fallout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/todd-howard-says-obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-aside-from-the-studios-fallout-dna-devs-did-something-similar-with-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "They had done something similar with [Star Wars] Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well. We knew we were going onto Skyrim, the franchise was back, but we knew there was going to be a long break until Fallout 4--how can we keep this going?"</p><p>Obsidian was founded by ex-Interplay and Black Isle Studios devs who previously worked on the original Fallout as well as a canceled version of Fallout 3. That made the studio a natural home for New Vegas. Howard also said that the only note Bethesda had ahead of development was to focus on the game's warring factions and the players' ability to choose between them.</p><p>"The thing that made New Vegas special was the ferocious focus on choice-and-consequence gameplay," added John Gonzalez, the lead creative designer for New Vegas. "It's all about allowing the player to have tremendous amounts of narrative impact, narrative control."</p><p>Celebrity gamer--and the voice of New Vegas' ghoul mechanic, Raul Alfonso Tejada--Danny Trejo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">demanded a New Vegas remaster</a>. For now, there's only a pricey <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6536671/" data-ref-id="1100-6536671">Fallout: New Vegas 15th anniversary collector's bundle</a> coming in June 2026 that's retailing for $155. And that's only for PC users.</p><p>Howard has remained elusive about the status of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, which isn't expected to arrive until well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. But he has said that Fallout is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-is-the-franchise-that-bethesda-is-doing-the-most-in-right-now/1100-6536889/" data-ref-id="1100-6536889">the franchise that we're doing the most in right now</a>."</p><p>The current second season of Prime Video's Fallout series is set in and around New Vegas.</p>

                <p>Highlighting an ongoing trend, the most popular games on PlayStation and Xbox are multiplayer, online, live-service titles that aren't necessarily "new," at least not in the traditional sense.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that 2025's top five most-played games for PlayStation and Xbox in the US were the same as 2024's, and in the case of PS5, the ranking was exactly the same.</p><p>On PS5, the top five most-played games in the US were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Roblox, and Minecraft, ranked in that order. That was the same as 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, which is ranked by an "active panel" of players.</p><p>On Xbox, the top five most-played games for 2025 in the US in order were Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA V, Minecraft, and Roblox. For 2024, the ranking went Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, and then Roblox.</p><p>Call of Duty's inclusion in the ranking is buoyed by the fact that multiple games are lumped into one single launcher. Currently, the launcher--COD HQ--includes the newest game, Black Ops 7, as well as last year's Black Ops 6, along with the free-to-play juggernaut Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Piscatella said the takeaway here is that, "Things are a bit established at the top."</p><p>This report followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/60-of-all-playtime-in-2023-was-spent-on-live-service-games-more-than-six-years-old/1100-6522366/" data-ref-id="1100-6522366">Newzoo study from 2024</a> that showed how 60% of playtime in games for games in 2023 were attributable to games more than five years old, including Fortnite, GTA V, Call of Duty, Roblox, and Minecraft.</p><p>Some have referred to these titles as "black hole" games because they suck up time, attention, and money to a significant degree, making it challenging for newcomers to find success.</p><p>Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox may not be "new," but they are live-service games that receive new content on a regular basis, creating opportunities for people to keep coming back to play and spend money. During the Christmas holiday week in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-were-the-top-15-most-popular-games-last-week-in-the-us/2900-7295/" data-ref-id="2900-7295">one in three people who turned on their PlayStation or Xbox played Fortnite.</a></p>

The recommended specs are also not particularly high-end outside of the 32GB RAM requirement, and target 1080p/60fps. This may be lower than many PC enthusiasts may want. There is no word on what a higher-end experience could require.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_QAoEnEO0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6_QAoEnEO0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>IO Interactive CTO Ulas Karademir said working with Nvidia allowed the studio to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves."</p><h2><strong>007: First Light PC requirements</strong></h2><h3><strong>Minimum:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 9500K / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li><strong>Graphic Card:</strong> Nvidia GTX 1660 / AMD RX 5700 / Intel discrete GPU equivalent</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 GB</li><li><strong>Video RAM:</strong> 8 GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 80 GB minimum</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11, 64-bit</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li><li><strong>Frame rate: </strong>30 FPS</li></ul><h3><strong>Recommended:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 13500 / AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li><strong>Graphic Card:</strong> Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti / AMD RX 6700 XT / Intel discrete GPU equivalent</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32 GB</li><li><strong>Video RAM:</strong> 12 GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 80 GB minimum</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11, 64-bit</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li><li><strong>Frame rate: </strong>60 FPS</li></ul><p>007: First Light is a third-person action-adventure game that tells the story of how James Bond earned his 00 status.
