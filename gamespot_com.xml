It's all detailed in the patch notes, which can be found below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">Stadium sports a "mercy rule,"</a> where if one team has a significant cash advantage and wins three rounds in a row, that team will immediately win. However, Blizzard notes that the need for a 15,000 cash disparity between teams to trigger the rule was making it so games weren't being ended early when they probably should have.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In order to make the mercy rule more effective, Blizzard has lowered the cash disparity needed to trigger it down to a 10,000 cash difference. Blizzard said it will keep an eye on the change and will consider making additional mercy rule changes in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Other Stadium mode changes include an additional cash bonus when both teams have lower than intended amounts of cash, and an increase to the amount of competitive points earned from matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most significant changes to Stadium are updates to the cost and power of certain items. Blizzard said that stacking large amounts of Weapon Power or Ability Power is currently too prevalent and "crowding out" other item choices. To make other items a more viable option, Blizzard has lowered the cost efficiency of many of the offending items by increasing their cost or slightly lowering their overall stats, while also buffing some weaker items.</p><p dir="ltr">On the hero balance-side of Stadium, Freja is now playable in the mode, while Reinhardt and Soldier: 76 have received some changes. Soldier: 76 will find it harder to one shot enemies with Helix Rocket after a nerf to the Cratered power that sees the ability's explosion damage reduced to 15% from 25%. Reinhardt received the most adjustments, with nerfs to the Rocket Strike item in order to compensate for buffs to Reinhardt's Fire Strike ability in core Overwatch, as well as nerfs to the Smashing power in order to tune down the hero's popular Melee damage build that Blizzard said is "performing too consistently."</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the changes in the patch are for Stadium, there are a few adjustments to hero balance in Overwatch 2's standard modes as well. The aforementioned Reinhardt Fire Strike changes have made it so the ability's projectile speed is faster and its recovery time reduced, while Freja, the game's newest hero, has received a slight nerf to her Quick Dash ability. Other changes include nerfs to Sombra to make her invisibility easier to deal with, buffs for Hanzo's primary fire, nerfs to Pharah's popular Drift Thrusters and Concussive Implosion perks, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below for the full list of changes. Overwatch 2's latest Season 16 update additionally added a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-collaboration-is-a-match-made-in-heaven/1100-6531643/" data-ref-id="1100-6531643">Street Fighter 6 crossover</a> and a new Overwatch Classic playlist that returns the game to how it was in October 2020. Blizzard recently detailed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Overwatch 2 Stadium mode roadmap</a>, outlining the heroes, maps, and more that will come to the mode in future seasons.  </p><h2>Overwatch 20 May 20 Patch Notes</h2><h4>General Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">Player Report Tool</p><ul><li>Players can now receive an instant notification if a player is already actioned.</li><li>Prior to this feature, reporting a player that had already been banned or suspended would not result in any additional information. The Instant Reporting Feedback feature will immediately inform the player of the fact that banned or suspended players have been actioned when they are reported.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Hazard</h5><p>Developer comments: Hazard's slower climbing fits his lumbering tank fantasy, but it was a point of friction when trying to chase down or escape from enemies, so we're speeding up how quickly he can vault over a ledge. Additionally, we're boosting Anarchic Zeal’s lifesteal as the current value wasn't effective enough.</p><p>Vault - Passive</p><ul><li>Ledge climb animation time reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 seconds.</li></ul><p>Anarchic Zeal - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Spike Guard’s Lifesteal is increased from 25% to 40%.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer comments: Reinhardt generally does well across the game but falls off in effectiveness at high ranks. We're increasing the speed and responsiveness of Fire Strike to make it more reliable from range.</p><p>Fire Strike - Ability 2</p><ul><li>Projectile speed increased from 25 to 30 meters per second.</li><li>Recovery time reduced from 0.63 to 0.45 seconds.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Freja</h5><p>Developer comments: Freja has continued to climb in win-rate now that players have become accustomed to her kit. We are partially reverting the Quick Dash cooldown to reduce her airtime and frequency of explosive bolts.</p><p>Quick Dash</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Genji</h5><p>Shuriken - Primary and Secondary Fire</p><ul><li>Ammo reduced from 30 to 24.</li><li>Projectile speed increased from 60 to 75.</li></ul><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer comments: Hanzo's been underperforming recently so we're reverting his bow draw speed back to its original, faster value. The Sonic Disruption perk isn't picked very often but increasing its duration will make it more useful and require less upkeep to control a health pack.</p><p>Storm Bow - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Draw time reduced from 0.8 to 0.72 seconds.</li></ul><p>Sonic Disruption - Minor Perk</p><ul><li>Health pack hack time increased from 12 to 30 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Pharah</h5><p>Developer comments: Drift Thrusters and Concussive Implosion have been too consistent at securing kills. These adjustments will give better opportunities for counterplay when fighting against these perks.</p><p>Drift Thrusters - Minor Perk</p><ul><li>Movement speed while using Barrage reduced by 20%.</li></ul><p>Concussive Implosion - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Distance pulled reduced by 50%.</li></ul><h5>Reaper</h5><p>Developer comments: We're aligning the recovery of Dire Triggers with Reaper’s primary fire to improve the flow when alternating between the two.</p><p>Dire Triggers - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Recovery reduced from 0.7 to 0.5 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Soldier: 76</h5><p>Developer comments: Stim Pack's button mapping made it difficult to activate, especially in combat. Binding it to Weapon Swap improves the control scheme and removing the anti-heal makes it less punishing to use.</p><p>Stim Pack - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Anti-heal removed. Now deals 75 self-damage on use.</li><li>Is now activated by using Weapon Swap.</li></ul><h5>Sombra</h5><p>Developer comments: Invisibility is a frustrating mechanic to play against for many, so we're increasing the windows for counterplay. Sombra will now take longer to exit stealth and to disappear after taking damage.</p><p>Translocator - Ability 2</p><ul><li>Fade in time increased from 0.15 to 0.3 seconds.</li><li>Stealth reveal duration on taking damage increased from 1 to 1.3 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Widowmaker</h5><p>Developer comments: Widowmaker is a more map-dependent hero than most and now with hero bans restricting her usefulness we're looking to make her viable in more situations.</p><p>Widow's Kiss - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Maximum spread reduced from 3 to 2 degrees.</li><li>Damage increased from 13 to 14.</li></ul><p>Deadly Deux</p><ul><li>Venom Mine's bonus damage increased from 50% to 100%.</li></ul><h4>Support</h4><h5>Illari</h5><p>Developer comments: Illari often has to move into high-risk positions to heal effectively. Extending the range on her healing beam will give her more flexibility in how she positions and supports her team.</p><p>Solar Rifle - Secondary Fire</p><ul><li>Range increased from 15 to 20 meters.</li></ul><h5>Lifeweaver</h5><p>Developer comments: The opportunity cost to use Thorn Volley is still too high compared to constantly charging Healing Blossom. We are improving the auto-charge to make weaving damage between healing less punishing.</p><p>Healing Blossom - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Auto-Charge rate increased by 25%.</li></ul><p>Superbloom - Major Perk</p><ul><li>The number of hits to trigger reduced from 20 to 16.</li></ul><h4>Stadium Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">Mercy Rule</p><ul><li>Now triggers when the cash disparity between the teams is at 10,000 or more (down from 15,000).</li></ul><p>Developer comments: We feel that not enough games that reach 3-0 are triggering the Mercy Rule when they probably should. We'll be keeping a close eye on this and will be considering other changes to the Mercy Rule system in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Round Completion Cash</p><p>We've added a system where players are granted an additional boost to their Round Completion Cash in rounds that end with players on both teams having lower than intended amounts of cash. This additional cash will be equivalent for every player.</p><p dir="ltr">Competitive Rewards</p><ul><li>Competitive points for winning a match has been increased to 20 per match.</li></ul><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer comments: To compensate for the buff to Reinhardt's Fire Strike in Core Overwatch, we're decreasing the burst potential of Reinhardt's Fire Strike build and normalizing the max projectile speed Fire Strike can reach. We're also tuning down Reinhardt's Melee build to be a bit more counterable, which is performing too consistently given the high payoff of the build.</p><p>Smashing - Power</p><ul><li>Reduced Move Speed per stack to 1% (down from 2%).</li><li>Reduced Life Steal per stack to 3% (down from 5%).</li><li>Increased maximum stacks to 10 (up from 5).</li><li>Reduced duration to 2s (down from 3s).</li></ul><p>To Me, My Friends! - Power</p><ul><li>Increased healing based on Max Life to 4% (up from 3%).</li></ul><p>Wilhelmwagen - Power</p><ul><li>Decreased healing from damage mitigated to 5% (down from 15%).</li></ul><p>Rocket Strike - Epic Hero Ability Item</p><ul><li>Decreased Fire Strike Projectile Speed to 25% (down from 50%).</li><li>Decreased Ability Power to 10% (down from 20%).</li></ul><p>Chimera's Maw - Rare Hero Ability Item</p><ul><li>Decreased Ability Power to 5% (down from 10%).</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Freja</h5><ul><li>Added to the Stadium Hero Roster</li></ul><p>Cyclone - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>When you use Updraft, fire a Take Aim bolt at your crosshair.</li></ul><p>Seekerpoint - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>When Take Aim bolt sticks an enemy, automatically fire 3 additional crossbow shots at them that deal 66% reduced damage.</li></ul><p>Seismic Shot - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>Take Aim explosion radius is increased by 33%.

<p dir="ltr">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat," Miyamoto said. "We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><p dir="ltr">Fans first noticed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-movie-features-a-redesigned-donkey-kong-shigeru-miyamoto-says/1100-6509563/" data-ref-id="1100-6509563">Donkey Kong's new look in the Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, and later spotted his updated design in footage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> and various Nintendo merchandise.
