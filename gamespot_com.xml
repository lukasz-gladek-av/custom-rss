                <p>Former Grand Theft Auto lead developer Leslie Benzies had an ugly exit from Rockstar Games nearly a decade ago when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-5-exec-suing-take-two-claims-hes-owed-1/1100-6438762/" data-ref-id="1100-6438762">he sued its parent company, Take-Two Interactive</a>. Benzies subsequently co-founded Build a Rocket Boy and developed a GTA-like game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/" data-ref-id="1100-6529472">MindsEye</a>, which is releasing next month. Now, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a "concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</p><p>Gerhard recently took part in a Q&amp;A session on Discord (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), where he agreed with the potentially explosive allegation that the negative responses to the game "were financed by someone." Gerhard's response to that suggestion was, "100%... Doesn't take much to guess who."</p><p>Although Gerhard didn't back down from his initial implication, he later clarified that he isn't accusing any specific players of being paid to bad mouth the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbhEMXn_osc" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="23">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rbhEMXn_osc?start=23" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p><p>Gerhard went on to suggest that "there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes" for MindsEye, but didn't elaborate beyond that.</p><p>MindsEye will be released on June 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who has a implant in his head that's called the MindsEye. That device gives Jacob the ability to control drones and a few other tricks. It also shows him glimpses of a mission he can't remember, which results in an unknown faction attempting to kill him before he can piece that part of his past together.</p>

                <p>Yuri Lowenthal, a voice actor who portrayed Yosuke Hanamura in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-4-golden/" data-ref-id="5000-115427">Persona 4</a>, seemingly revealed that a Persona 4 remake was in the works in a Bluesky post about not being invited back. Atlus has still not confirmed a remake of this RPG classic is in the works.</p><p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remarked on Bluesky</a>. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they donâ€™t want me to come back."</p><p>Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have been swirling ever since Persona 3 Reload launched last February. These rumors have gained traction in recent months, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jvwo7r/according_to_extas1s_gears_collection_silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers like extas1s</a> claiming that it will be revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase. Atlus has not commented on these rumors at all, though, so Lowenthal's comments are the first we've heard about a Persona 4 remake from anyone who could potentially be in the know about it.</p><p>If true, it's disappointing to hear that Lownethal won't return to portray Yosuke in a potential remake of Persona 4. It would line up with Atlus' approach to voice acting for Persona 3 Reload, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reloaded-will-feature-an-entirely-new-voice-cast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no voice actors from the original</a> portrayed their characters in that remake either. Lownethal's comments suggest that this is a deliberate choice on Atlus' part, not related to voice actor availability, and that other Persona 4 voice actors also won't be returning to portray their iconic characters.</p><p>If the rumors are true and a Persona 4 remake is real, it seems like Atlus could reveal it during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. Fans of classic RPGs also have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-screenshots/2900-6619/" data-ref-id="2900-6619">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a> to look forward to this year.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Mobile's latest crossover event is coming soon, and it's not what we expected. The mobile shooter is getting a Nie: Automata crossover beginning May 30, promising a range of themed items based on the franchise for Call of Duty players.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/05/call-of-duty-mobile-season-five-primal-reckoning" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nier crossover</a>, players take control of the YorHa Unit as they fight against Machine Lifeforms, Activision said in the announcement. Players can complete objectives in the game to earn rewards, including the Kui Ji - YoRHa No. 9 Type S operator. Four new NieR-themed melee weapons are included in the crossover event, too, along with the AK-47 Final Apocalypact weapon.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at the Nier crossover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGyui44MEU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YMGyui44MEU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty: Mobile is developed by Tencent's TiMi Studios. It currently operates alongside Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, but that game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-pulling-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-from-ios-and-google-play-stores/1100-6531616/" data-ref-id="1100-6531616">recently removed from mobile marketplaces as Activision winds it down.</a> Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">had high hopes for the game</a>, but reports suggest it's making a <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1925560933193068677" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fraction of the money</a> that Call of Duty: Mobile brings in.</p><p>Call of Duty: Mobile is not connected to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or Warzone, so it's not clear if the NieR crossover could come to those games. What is confirmed, however, is that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/" data-ref-id="1100-6531690">new Call of Duty Season 4 update</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">adding a John Wick / Ballerina crossover</a>. The Season 4 update lands May 29.</p><p>As for the Nier series, the latest entry in the series was 2017's Nier: Automata. No new entries in the franchise have been announced. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's reportedly a new dedicated gaming app from Apple planned for all of its devices--from iPhone to Apple TV--that the company looks to launch around Nintendo Switch 2's release on June 5. The app sounds like a mix of a store launcher to pick up games as well as a social hub to replace Game Center.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, this will be a major push from Apple to appeal to players and game developers. The app will apparently feature achievements, leaderboards, and social features. Additionally, the Mac version supposedly will include games bought and downloaded from other storefronts. Rumblings of a dedicated gaming app first appeared late last year at <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/" rel="nofollow ">9to5Mac</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">That's not all from Apple on the gaming front, either. Earlier this week, the company acquired Sneaky Sasquatch maker RAC7, per <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="nofollow ">Digital Trends</a>. The purchase of the two-person studio is reportedly the first time Apple has ever bought a gaming developer. Sneaky Sasquatch is one of the most popular games on the subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/#1">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The dedicated gaming app also comes almost five years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-fortnite-ban-and-apple-google-legal-battle-explained/1100-6480913/">Fortnite maker Epic took Apple (and Google) to court</a> over App Store policies that didn't allow for companies to get direct payment from users. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/">Fortnite finally returned to iOS</a> in the US just over a week ago after almost a half-decade off the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple has also spent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-ambitions/1100-6525131/">touting its gaming pedigree</a>, even stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-15-pro-is-best-game-console-apple-says/1100-6517793/">the iPhone 15 Pro was going to be the best gaming console</a> in 2023. Then, last year, Apple launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-16-has-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-and-native-support-for-aaa-games/1100-6526379/">the iPhone 16 with hardware-accelerated ray tracing</a> and support for AAA games like Assassin's Creed Mirage and Death Stranding.</p>

                <p>Video game retailer GameStop is a big believer in Bitcoin. The Grapevine, Texas-based company disclosed today, May 28, that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. At the current trading rates, that's worth more than $510 million USD.</p><p>Bitcoin is one of the world's most valuable, and volatile, assets. It's currently <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worth more than $2 trillion overall</a>, which is ahead of the total market cap of Google's parent company Alphabet. The current price for one Bitcoin is about $108,000.</p><p>GameStop's press release announcing the purchase of Bitcoin is <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/GameStop-Announces-Purchase-of-Bitcoin/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a single sentence long</a>, and there is no word on why GameStop did this or what its plans are. The announcement was not a surprise, though, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/gamestop-is-considering-investing-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-sources-say.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported in February</a> that GameStop was planning to buy cryptocurrencies. On May 27, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-bitcoin-stock-sale-c2db8214871452b88950bc10b567d1ec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated his desire to create a "Bitcoin treasury."</a></p><p>In any event, GameStop's share price is up around 10% so far in 2025 and up more than 3,000% since the short-squeeze situation of 2021. GameStop had cash reserves of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/gamestop-shares-rise-as-retailer-meme-stock-buys-first-bitcoin-batch-scooping-up-500-million.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $4.5 billion as of February 2025</a>, according to the company's latest filings.</p><p>Buying Bitcoin is GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen's latest strategy to help the struggling company turn things around; other measures have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-makes-a-surprise-profit-warns-of-impending-store-closures/1100-6526415/" data-ref-id="1100-6526415">layoffs, store closures, and selling Game Informer.</a></p><p>Cohen has the power to do this in part because GameStop's board voted in December 2023 to allow Cohen and two other board members to use GameStop's cash pile to purchase securities as part of a new <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250404496/gamestops-stock-is-climbing-again-this-is-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"investment policy."</a></p><p>GameStop previously invested in NFTs and created its own cryptocurrency wallet, but the company shuttered this in January 2024.</p>
