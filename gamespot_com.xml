                <p>In 2020, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/" data-ref-id="1100-6473383">left the company</a> after over two decades as one of the driving forces behind the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. While Houser has since launched a new company, Absurd Ventures, he recently shared his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and explained why Bully 2 never materialized.</p><p>During a panel appearance at Los Angeles Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>), Houser was asked about how he feels regarding GTA 6, the first Grand Theft Auto game in decades that he had no involvement with.</p><p>"I think it's a great privilege to have worked on something that big--you know, I wrote the last 10 or 11 of them, so I think the world's probably had enough GTA from me ... There's always a new story, so it's not going to be a story that I wrote or a character set that I developed. I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure."</p><p>Houser has previously voiced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-on-bully-sequel-i-know-i-want-to/1100-6414948/" data-ref-id="1100-6414948">his desire to see a sequel</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, the 2006 game set at a boarding school. When he was asked about the reasons why Bully 2 didn't come to pass, Houser cited "bandwidth issues," before adding, "If you've got a small lead creative team and a a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want ... With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p><p>Picking a favorite game from his time at Rockstar proved to be difficult for Houser. He noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> was "the best thing that I worked on [and the] best single kind of realization of open-world storytelling thematic consistency and understanding how the games are assembled to take you on an an emotional journey." He also cited GTA 4, GTA 5, Bully, and Red Dead Redemption as some of his best experiences at Rockstar.</p><p>Houser's next project is a comic book miniseries called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-boss-american-caper-comic-book-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6535074/" data-ref-id="1100-6535074">American Caper</a>, which will be released by Dark Horse Comics on November 12. He also said that Absurd Ventures' first video games will be a currently untitled "open-world third-person comedy," and A Better Paradise, which he described as "a third-person dystopian tragedy." Both games are still early in development.</p>

                <p>A new Lord of the Rings game is in development and is a third-person action game designed to "compete with Hogwarts Legacy," according to a new report.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> said it heard from sources close to the project that the unannounced and untitled game is funded, in part, by the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), to the tune of around $100 million USD. A deal could be made public as soon as next week, the report said.</p><p>In addition to ADIO, the rumored new Lord of the Rings game is said to involve Embracer, which is the company that owns the rights to Lord of the Rings games (and other extensions of the fantasy series). The developer Revenge is said to be involved as well.</p><p>A spokesperson for Embracer said, "We do not comment on rumors or speculation." The developer Revenge declined to comment as well when approached by Insider Gaming.</p><p>The report had no specific details on the supposed new Lord of the Rings game, so it's unclear at this stage what it means that the game could be designed to compete with Hogwarts Legacy. That game, released in 2023, was an enormous success, becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">No. 1 best-selling game of the year in the US.</a> A sequel is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">now a top priority at Warner Bros.</a></p><p>As for The Lord of the Rings, games based on the franchise have not fared all that well of late. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum had such a troubled launch in 2023 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gollum-studios-next-lotr-game-canceled-dev-no-longer-making-games-at-all/1100-6515620/" data-ref-id="1100-6515620">its developer canceled its next game and stopped making games altogether.</a> This year's Tales of the Shire got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-the-shire-review-concerning-and-also-there-are-hobbits/1900-6418389/" data-ref-id="1900-6418389">mixed reviews.</a></p><p>The existence of a new Lord of the Rings game from Embracer is no surprise at all, as the company said more than a year ago that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lord-of-the-rings-games-being-prototyped-right-now/1100-6525818/" data-ref-id="1100-6525818">prototyping multiple new games.</a> Before this, Embracer's Lord of the Rings boss, Lee Guinchard, spoke about how <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he wants there to be a renaissance for Lord of the Rings games.</a></p><p>In addition to this new mysterious project, Embracer is working with Amazon Games currently on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-lord-of-the-rings-games-on-the-way/1100-6514561/" data-ref-id="1100-6514561">new MMO in the Middle-earth universe</a>.</p><p>There have been many iconic Lord of the Rings games over the years. In particular, some of the early movie tie-ins were well-received, while the more recent Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War were enjoyable as well--but developer Monolith has since shut down. On the less-serious side, there are also Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego The Hobbit titles that are fondly remembered. Check out the gallery below to see some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-games-ranked/1100-6503738/" data-ref-id="1100-6503738">best Lord of the Rings games ever.</a></p><p>Beyond video games, Embracer is working with Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on multiple upcoming films, including The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in Peter Jackson's original The Lord of the Rings series, is coming back to direct this film.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has announced that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> emote associated with retiring WWE superstar and current movie mega-star John Cena has been disabled, maybe indefinitely, because of its possible Nazi connection.</p><p>Peaceful Hips, <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an emote in the popular battle royale shooter</a>, was created in collaboration between James Gunn's DC show Peacemaker and Epic Games. The emote sees your character goofily rotate their hips before making alternating "L" shapes with their arms. If you've watched Peacemaker, then you're familiar with the dance; it's what Cena performs in the second season's opening montage. It's awkward and stiff, which is what's supposed to make it a lighthearted gaff, particularly given the character's often violent personality. However, with the show's latest episode, the quirky dance--and Fortnite emote--have taken on a whole new meaning.</p><h4>Light Spoilers for Peacemaker S2, E6</h4><p>Titled "Ignorance Is Chris," the September 25 episode sees Peacemaker discover that the alternate dimension he's so fond of is actually Nazi America. This version of the US shows a true Anglo state, where there are only white people, and the stars of the American flag have been replaced with swastikas. It's this fact that unlocks the new meaning behind Peacemaker's dance in the opening of Season 2; those alternating "L" shapes he's making with his arms are stand-ins for the swastika.</p><p>With some <a href="https://x.com/JonesyFrotting/status/1971989740489789894" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans pointing this</a> out on <a href="https://x.com/CTropes/status/1971797634576011500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter</a>, Epic Games has pulled the emote offline, possibly indefinitely, as it investigates its partner's "creative intentions."</p><p>"We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote," Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X/Twitter</a> on September 28. "Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><p>Peacemaker showrunner James Gunn hasn't publicly commented on the situation. As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-quickly-pulls-peacemaker-emote-while-it-figures-out-our-partners-creative-intentions-after-the-shows-huge-twist-gives-it-a-whole-new-meaning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, however, Gunn <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promoted the collab on X/Twitter</a> on September 13. Considering how frequently he posts on the social media site, there's a possibility he'll say something about Epic Games' decision.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Hades 2 is the first sequel that Supergiant has ever created. The studio formed in 2009 and previously made Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and the original Hades. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review</a> rewarded the follow-up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-10-10-review-score/2900-153/#16">a prestigious 10/10</a>--the second title to earn that score this year (Split Fiction being the other).</p><p>Looking ahead, Supergiant hasn't teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-dev-on-how-it-will-choose-next-game-and-major-industry-issues/1100-6535044/">what could be next from the developer</a>. However, it's expected that Hades 2 will come to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in the future, similarly to the original.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">A new horror-game announcement pretty much always intrigues me, but when a studio reveals a game that's said to kick off a whole new connected horror universe, that's the type of ambitious first step that really grabs me. Such is the case with ProbablyMonsters' upcoming first-person horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ire-a-prologue/" data-ref-id="5000-689180">Ire: A Prologue</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, Ire: A Prologue is the very beginning of the Ire universe--a brand-new series led in part by CJ Cowan, who previously worked as story lead at Bungie and helped bring to life the years-long sagas of both Halo and Destiny. Cowan's expertise is in expanding worlds such as the one Ire is set to unveil, but it all starts with this first game, which, based on my hands-off demo, will intrigue fans of games like Alien: Isolation and Amnesia.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ny09rlWHI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1ny09rlWHI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Ire: A Prologue, players take on the role of a young girl named Emily who, in 1986, finds herself trapped in a timeloop on a boat while a monster roams the halls. Like in Alien: Isolation or the most recent Amnesia sequel, The Bunker, the monster is an AI enemy and not adherent to a script. This means every interaction can go any number of ways, and since you'll be looping through its world over and over, there's every reason to believe you'll repeatedly need to outwit the creature by hiding in lockers and vents or staying in the shadows as it lingers nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">In my demo, I loved catching merely glimpses of the beast, which seems to be a wholly original monster the game's story referred to as the Drüdgen. Cowan told me the team was inspired by things like 1979's Alien when it comes to hiding its central monster, thereby making it more fearsome.</p><p dir="ltr">"The more we hide the monster, the more we can really scare the player. But also [we can] put our calories into the important parts of the game. And so we ended up building a bunch of complex systems around that, where the monster turns off lights within its radius, and even turns off your flashlight if it gets too close. And so you start using those as clues as to where the monster is. You know, when you see a light go off at the end of the hallway, you know the monster is about."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576804-ireaprlogueitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576804" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576804-ireaprlogueitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576804"></a><figcaption>Lore items you find will be left in your safe space hub between loops, letting you dig into the story without fear of the monster attacking.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576804-ireaprlogueitems.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I hardly caught an image of the creature, what really grabbed me were the strange sounds it made. They're hard to describe, but the way I spoke of them to Cowan was that it sounded sort of like the monster was gargling or drowning. Cowan revealed how a particular source inspires those sounds. "The initial inspiration for the audio of the monster was the bear from Annihilation," Cowan explained, referring to Alex Garland's 2018 film. "It's some really cool, kind of vocal stuff where it was almost trying to speak. There's some fun stuff [later in the game] where it starts mimicking Emily's voice, talking back to her."</p><p dir="ltr">I found it an interesting choice to declare this game as the first part in a more expansive universe. I wondered what the advantages of that approach are, which Cowan spoke to as someone who has gone down both paths past that figurative fork in the road.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you look at the people on the team and the experience that we have, we've done a lot of franchise-building in our past work, going from Halo 2 to Halo 3 to ODST and Reach. Everyone would like to think we had big plans, and had the entire arc of Master Chief [laid out]. That wasn't the case. We would finish the game and then be like, 'Okay, well, what happens next?' You know, we try to figure it out ourselves.</p><p dir="ltr">"And this is something that the leads on the team are super passionate about, building a franchise and slowly peeling back the layers of that franchise over time and digging deeper and deeper into it. And so there's a lot in this game that are seeds for what comes next. And I'm super stoked about that."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576809-ireaprologuedeck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576809" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576809-ireaprologuedeck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576809"></a><figcaption>Inside the ship, your flashlight is key, but outside, you'll find brief moments of calming sunshine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4576809-ireaprologuedeck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cowan smirked as he shot down my follow-up question regarding whether Ire will be an anthology or one continuous storyline--"I'm not gonna spoil that!"--but he did mention how the hub space Emily will routinely return to becomes sort of a safe zone where players can look into items they've found on their journey, such as cassette tapes and photographs. It seems to me that these items, perhaps among other aspects of the story in Ire: A Prologue, will serve as the breadcrumbs for players to follow if they want to make sense of Ire both in this first game and in games that will follow.</p><p dir="ltr">Ire: A Prologue will kick off its wider story universe when it arrives just in time for Halloween, October 28, on PC. A free demo will arrive on Steam a bit sooner on October 13.</p>
