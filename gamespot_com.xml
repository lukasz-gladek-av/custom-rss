                <p>Since it was first revealed, Rebellion's upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall</a> has often been compared to Bethesda's Fallout. While both games do share a few similarities--from post-apocalyptic themes to killer robots--Rebellion says the game is more than just Fallout with a British coat of paint.</p><p>"Once you play it for a bit, you're like, 'oh, this is its own thing for sure,'" art director Ryan Greene explained to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-atomfall-developers-knew-it-would-be-compared-to-fallout-as-soon-as-it-was-revealed-average-playthrough-around-25-hours" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "And one of our owners, Jason Kingsley, he's a big Fallout fan, so inevitably there was going to be some parallels in that any kind of survival in the apocalypse, immediately Fallout's going to come up as a thing. And those guys are great at what they do. And that's cool. The reality is, here's this very successful franchise and we're version 1.0. To be compared to those guys--thank you very much--yes, we appreciate it because thatâ€™s a skillful team that's making that stuff."</p><p>Another key differentiator in the game is its lack of a traditional main quest, as players will instead work their way through several interconnected stories that all eventually connect to the overarching mystery of the game. Greene added that Atomfall will even allow you to adopt a non-lethal approach to playing the game, and he's "fairly certain" that the game can be completed without needing to kill a single person.</p><p>In his hands-on impressions of Atomfall, GameSpot's Jake Dekkeras wrote about how the game has more in common with cult-classic investigative adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paradise-killer/" data-ref-id="5000-506065">Paradise Killer</a> than Fallout.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1230313219" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

detective game. Yes, the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest," Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-is-a-detective-game-in-a-post-apocalyptic-england/1100-6529960/">Atomfall preview</a>. "From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together."</p><p>Atomfall will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on March 27, and it'll also be a day-one release through Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Konami is alerting players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> features a range of potentially upsetting topics, including depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence. A <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/us/en/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">notice on the game's website</a> mentions this, along with Konami's statement about how the content in the game does not reflect the opinions of people involved with making the game. This all came about as part of the Silent Hill Transmission livestream <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">where a new trailer also debuted.</a></p><p>"This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved," Konami said. "If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</p><p>Silent Hill f carries an M rating from the ESRB. The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40315/silent-hill-f/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB's ratings description</a> says the game's cutscenes show "gore and more intense acts of violence," including a character being burned alive; a woman being branded with a hot iron; and a character cutting someone's face open.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-eMuy6UJ6U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-eMuy6UJ6U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Silent Hill f tells the story of Shimizu Hinako, a teenage girl who is "struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society." She was cheerful and full of life as a child, but now only rarely smiles, Konami said. A "deep fog" descends on her home town, infesting it with dangers.</p><p>"Hinako must solve puzzles and fight for her life in her struggle to survive. Her struggle to reach the inevitable decision that must be made. And her struggle to put an end to that which must be slain," Konami said in the game's description.</p><p>Konami didn't share a release date for Silent Hill f, but it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>.</p>

Somehow, Bungie accidentally released some of its Rite of the Nine activities prematurely during the latest update. But the good news is that players will be able to keep any of the weapons they earned from completing those activities.</p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_03_13_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official site</a>, the devs chalked up the error to the will of the Nine, and added that, "Their will <em>is </em>their own." The company went on to explain that the Rite of the Nine activities accidentally leaked in Update 8.2.5 were in an extremely early state with temporary art and "fake perk rolls." The final versions of those activities will be more refined, and optimized for Explorer, Eternity, and Ultimatum modes.</p><p>Luckily, Bungie accepted the mistake with good humor, and noted that the early-bird weapons won't be removed from anyone's inventory. That said, the weapons will be modified a bit to prevent any rule-breaking combos. And they will be available when Rite of the Nine launches some time after the beginning of Heresy Act III.</p><p>In the meantime, Guardian Games participants can dive into the new boss rush mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rushdown-guide-boss-rush-challenge-rewards-and-encounters-explained/1100-6530070/" data-ref-id="1100-6530070">Rushdown</a>.
