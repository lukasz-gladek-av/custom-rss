                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-fortnite-ban-and-apple-google-legal-battle-explained/1100-6480913/" data-ref-id="1100-6480913">ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple</a> has fired up again recently after a district-court injunction led Epic to attempt to get Fortnite back on the US App Store for the first time in five years. Apple has since blocked the submission, and Epic is appealing to the court to uphold its injunction against Apple.</p><p>After Apple left the Fortnite submission unaddressed for over a week, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-wont-be-coming-to-ios-soon-as-apple-blocks-epics-app-store-submission/1100-6531588/" data-ref-id="1100-6531588">finally responded to Epic</a> to block Fortnite's return in the US. Apple has said that it won't take action on the Fortnite submission "until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction," a move Epic believes is in violation of the injunction itself. In response, Epic has filed a second Motion to Enforce Injunction with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">California district court in question</a>.</p><p>Epic Games managed to get Fortnite back on iPhones <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-back-on-iphone-after-4-years-depending-on-where-you-live/1100-6525849/" data-ref-id="1100-6525849">in Europe last year</a>, thanks to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, but the game is currently offline again in the EU due to the ongoing drama with the US App Store.</p><p>In a letter sent by Apple, the company suggests Epic resubmit Fortnite only for EU territories "to prevent our discussions surrounding the US storefront of the App Store from impacting Fortnite in other geographies." The letter further recommends submitting Fortnite to the US App Store "separately through an entity other than Epic Sweden," but Epic's <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1923558197802971459" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> suggests this recommendation is in violation of Apple's own guidelines.</p><p>"That's not the standard Apple holds other developers to and it's blocking us from releasing our update in the EU and US," Epic says. "Apple is again retaliating against Epic for challenging the legality of their anticompetitive behavior and we will fight on."</p><p>The next step in this legal battle is now with the courts, with Apple having filed a request for partial stay with the Ninth Circuit Court, and Epic filing a Motion to Enforce Injunction with the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The district court judge who filed the latest injunction against Apple has also referred the case to a US criminal attorney for possible contempt charges.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Fortnite's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-start-date-star-wars-battle-pass-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6530938/" data-ref-id="1100-6530938">Star Wars-themed Galactic Battle event</a> reintroduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">Darth Vader</a> to the game with a twist. Thanks to an AI-generated voice based on the late <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-and-lion-king-actor-james-earl-jones-dies-at-93/1100-6526373/" data-ref-id="1100-6526373">James Earl Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">players can speak to Darth Vader</a> in real time and get the Dark Lord of the Sith to respond <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">within certain limitations</a>. Now SAG-AFTRA--the actors union which is currently engaged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-and-publishers-clash-over-best-and-last-offer-to-end-the-strike/1100-6531336/" data-ref-id="1100-6531336">in a protracted voiceover performers strike</a> against video game publishers, largely over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">the use of AI voices</a>--has filed an unfair-labor-practice complaint against Epic Games for Fortnite's use of Darth Vader's AI voice.</p><p>Two years before Jones passed away in 2024, he retired as the voice of Darth Vader and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-earl-jones-steps-back-as-darth-vaders-voice-as-ai-takes-over-the-role/1100-6507813/" data-ref-id="1100-6507813">signed a deal that allows an AI program to recreate his iconic voice</a> in perpetuity. SAG-AFTRA's filing contends that the deal with Jones' estate doesn't extend to other voice actors who have portrayed Darth Vader in its filing with the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles," noted a SAG-AFTRA spokesperson via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/sag-aftra-fortnites-ai-darth-vader-unfair-labor-complaint-1236405218/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vaderâ€™s iconic rhythm and tone in video games."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA contends that Fortnite's parent companies, Llama Productions and Epic Games, committed the unfair labor act by failing to disclose its intent to replace a human performer with AI and for not coming to an agreement with the union ahead of time.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the filing will have any effect on Vader's presence in the game. In the meantime, fans have posted numerous videos on social media that encourage the AI Vader to say off-the-wall and sometimes-offensive things. </p><p>Fortnite's Star Wars Galactic Battle event will continue until June 7.</p>
