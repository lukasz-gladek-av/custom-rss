                <p dir="ltr">To promote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">preorders for the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>, Asus looked to one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#9">the most popular video games of all time</a>: Grand Theft Auto V. Michael De Santa actor Ned Luke and Franklin Clinton actor Shawn Fonteno appear in a new social media ad talking about the upcoming portable PC devices.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's handheld freedom for everybody," says Fonteno in the clip posted <a href="https://x.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1971559948997001486" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> by Asus. "You know you gotta have an ally, and Xbox picked the right Ally," adds Luke. Microsoft and Asus finally revealed the price points for the two PC portable devices yesterday. The ROG Xbox Ally will cost $600 in the US, while the Xbox Ally X will cost $1,000. Both handhelds will launch October 16.</p><p dir="ltr">The base model ROG Xbox Ally has drawn comparisons to the Steam Deck OLED from a specs perspective, featuring an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor (Zen 4), 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Meanwhile, the premium Xbox Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor (Zen 5), 24GB DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. In June, GameSpot got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">hands-on time with the Xbox Ally X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/articles/gaming/rog-travel-has-assembled-a-legendary-cast-for-its-new-rog-xbox-ally-video/" rel="nofollow ">Asus announced</a> that the GTA V stars would "help get folks aboard the ROG Xbox Ally hype train" last month. Previously, the company has <a href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming/rog-teams-up-with-iconic-voice-actors-in-cheeky-new-video/" rel="nofollow ">worked with GTA V star Steven Ogg</a> (Trevor Philips), too.</p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft revealed that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">raising Xbox prices once again</a> in the US. Starting October 3, the Xbox Series S will retail for $400 (up from $380), while the Xbox Series X 1TB will cost $650 (up from $600).</p>

Since then, fans have clamored for Konami to complete the collection of games with Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. Now, the producer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has confirmed that Vol. 2 is still in the works, but declined to confirm any titles included in it.</p><p>During a presentation at the Tokyo Game Show, Metal Gear Solid producer Noriaki Okamura fielded a question about the next installment of the MGS Master Collection.

The first Master Collection excluded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker/" data-ref-id="5000-43585">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>, a 2010 PlayStation Portable game that had previously been remastered in 2011 for the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection.

But without confirmation from Konami, we can only speculate.</p><p>In the meantime, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-mode-launching-in-october-no-microtransactions-or-cross-play/1100-6535016/" data-ref-id="1100-6535016">Fox Hunt multiplayer mode</a> will launch on October 30.

But if there are new MGS games being made, Okamura and Korekado expressed a desire to step aside and let a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-era-of-metal-gear-solid-is-being-entrusted-to-a-new-generation-of-developers-if-its-made/1100-6534207/" data-ref-id="1100-6534207">new generation of developers</a> make the title.</p>
