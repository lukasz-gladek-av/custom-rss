                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>

                <p>Have you been waiting to hear any news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> recently? Well, you might be in luck because the upcoming game has recently been given an age rating, suggesting that it may be getting a release date pretty soon.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, a listing for Metroid Prime 4 has gone up on South Korea's <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">classification board</a> where it is currently rated for "ages 12 and up" due to mild violence. The content of the listing itself doesn't reveal much else about the content of the game, but the filing does suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is indeed closing in on the finish line and could still stand to release later this year, where it's being pegged as a holiday release at the moment.</p><p>Additionally, VGC reports that the listing comes around the same time that it's been hearing of an imminent Nintendo Direct, where it is believed that a formal release date will finally be provided.</p><p>It's been a long road for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced at E3 in 2017, the game has changed developers and undergone at least one reboot before being re-announced with the subtitle Beyond back in 2024. Since then, there's been a steady drip of information, including the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">first hands-on previews</a> earlier this year, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-out-now-poster-spotted-in-london/1100-6532578/" data-ref-id="1100-6532578">bizarre advertisement</a> in the London Underground that falsely claimed the game was "out now."</p><p>Now, Metroid Prime 4 seems likely to launch by the end of 2025 on both the Nintendo Switch, which it was first announced for, and its successor, the Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Just a day after release, publisher 505 Games has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> that addresses several performance issues, fixes some bugs, and grants missing preorder bonuses. Alongside the fixes, all players will receive the game's original soundtrack DLC as a form of apology.</p><p>The patch notes detail the addition of a manual toggle for low latency mode, which is now no longer enabled by default, as well as VRAM optimization for lower-end GPUs. 505 Games says it has also fixed an issue where the game may crash immediately after the company logo during startup. It has also resolved a stuttering issue during finisher animations.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has revealed an updated roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which includes a September 16 release date for the Claws of Awaji expansion. This new expansion will be free to anyone who preordered the game, and it can also be purchased separately if you missed the preorder window.</p><p>Claws of Awaji looks like it'll add a significant amount of content, as in addition to a new weapon class for Naoe to master, there'll also be more abilities to learn, gear to acquire, and enemies to encounter. Overall, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6ogkWkxq1HusqpqGtQvCpn/assassins-creed-shadows-summer-roadmap-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft estimates</a> that the expansion will add another 10 hours of content to Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p>Other updates on the way include New Game Plus mode, which will be available starting July 29. Selecting this mode will reset your story and objective board progression, but you'll get to keep all of the skills, gear, and knowledge ranks you've earned, as well as your Hideout progression. You won't have to sit through tutorials on your playthrough, as you can fast-forward to the end of the prologue chapters.</p><p>The level cap is being increased from 60 to 80 for all players, and new Mastery ranks, Knowledge Skill ranks, and upgrades for all Hideout buildings--including new upgrades for Heiji's Forge--are on the way. Several big quality-of-life upgrades will arrive in a September update, before the Claws of Awaji expansion goes live. Here's a closer look at what's on the horizon:</p><ul><li>Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog will completely lift</li><li>The ability to skip time-of-day, jumping ahead to dusk or dawn</li><li>A new Forge upgrade level to reach Mythic--from Epic--and Artifact--from Legendary--equipment rarities</li><li>Hideout updates and upgrades.</li><li>Uncapped framerate for cutscenes on PC</li><li>Additional "goodies" that might be familiar to long-time series fans</li><li>Further bug fixes and stability improvements</li></ul><p>In related news, Ubisoft recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">Assassin's Creed Shadows has crossed the 5 million players mark</a>, and the company teased that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints" rel="nofollow ">could arrive on new platforms in the future</a>. The game has so far "performed in line with expectations," Ubisoft says, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/" data-ref-id="1100-6533378">live-action Netflix series adaptation</a> of the franchise is finally in development, five years after it was first announced.</p>
