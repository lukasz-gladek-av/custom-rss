                <p>Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date "03.04.25." Now, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.</p><p>The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he has been in contact with Activision</a> about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the long-running franchise will continue</a>.</p><p>If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer</a>. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. Hawk has obviously moved on to better accommodations since then, but we're eager to see where the video game series can go with the full power of the current gen consoles.</p>

                <p>Nintendo Alarmo is now available to <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase for $100 at Best Buy</a>. The Nintendo-themed interactive alarm clock first released in October at the Nintendo Store, but you needed a Switch Online membership to buy it. At that time, Nintendo said Alarmo would launch at major retailers in March 2025. The quirky accessory has arrived a bit earlier than expected.</p><p>Alarmo is currently only available at Best Buy (and the Nintendo Store). That said, we'd expect the gamified alarm clock to pop up at other major retailers soon, including Walmart, Target, and GameStop. It's possible Amazon will sell it, too. While the online retail giant doesn't carry Nintendo Switch products at this time, it still stocks a wide variety of official Nintendo merch.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3181" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nintendo Alarmo" data-collection="" title="[Various] Nintendo Alarmo">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17401681870318?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value">Nintendo Alarmo - Interactive Alarm Clock</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17401681870318?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value">$100</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Mario-red alarm clock has a dynamic front display and built-in speaker. Before you go to sleep, you can choose which Nintendo characters and games will wake you up the next morning.</p><p>Alarmo launched with sights and sounds from five Nintendo Switch hits, including Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. So far, Nintendo has added two more games to the lineup via free post-launch updates: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p>In total, there are over 40 scenes that can be watched on the screen when the corresponding tracks from the game pull you out of your slumber. You can opt for the volume to increase over time. As a heavy sleeper, I use this setting.</p><p>Nintendo Alarmo displays scenes from the following games:</p><ul><li>Super Mario Odyssey</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li><li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li><li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li><li>Splatoon 3</li><li>Pikmin 4</li><li>Ring Fit Adventure</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Alarmo has several cool interactive features, too. The built-in motion sensor lets you snooze your alarm with a gesture or a button press (it's your choice). Nintendo characters from the games above can also respond to motion-detected gestures.</p><p>Throughout the day, Alarmo can be used to remind you what time it is by setting it to play music at specific intervals. It can also track your sleep and let you know how often you're tossing and turning, which provides a general idea of the quality of your sleep.</p><p>Alarmo is powered with the included USB-C cable. While it doesn't work wirelessly, the included coin battery saves your settings, so if you need to move the clock to another room or your power goes out, you can plug it back in without needing to set it up again.</p><p>Nintendo plans to release more updates, including new scenes, for Alarmo in the future. Updates are free, but you need to connect the device to Wi-Fi to download them.</p><p>In the world of very unofficial updates, it's <em>technically</em> possible to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hacker-puts-playable-version-of-doom-on-nintendo-alarmo/1100-6527574/" data-ref-id="1100-6527574">play Doom on Nintendo Alarmo</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">Although a big playtest similar to the 2XKO Alpha Lab 1 playtest now won't be coming until later this year, the update isn't all bad news. Rivera also officially revealed some new features coming to 2XKO. One major change will see the game's Pulse Fuse (which enables beginner-friendly autocombos) removed. However, autocombo functionality will instead be added as a toggleable option in the game's settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Rivera said this was done for two reasons. The first was so players could take advantage of the game's powerful Fuses while still using autocombos. The other reason is so that when playing as a team, each player could go with their own autocombo preference instead of being locked into using them or not via the Pulse Fuse.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an entirely new Fuse coming, Sidekick, that will actually remove the tag functionality from Riot's tag-based fighter. Sidekick makes it so a team's point and assist character can't swap places, with the point character gaining bonus health to make up for the fact that they can't be tagged out. It essentially turns one character, or one player if playing co-op, into a support character only capable of using assist attacks, in a way channeling one of the core roles from League of Legends itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We received a ton of feedback from players who wanted an experience that felt like more of a support role where they could learn the game at their own pace, and we are excited to hear what you all think when you get a chance to check it out in the future," Rivera said.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO, which will be free-to-play, is slated to release sometime in 2025 but does not have an official release date. Players got their first major hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-alpha-lab-playtest-players-can-expect-a-decent-amount-of-jank-riot-says/1100-6525611/" data-ref-id="1100-6525611">2XKO as part of its Alpha Lab playtest in August 2024</a>, which was live for a little over a week. At the time, Riot warned players the playtest would have a "decent amount of jank" and work-in-progress elements. Those interested in joining future playtests can sign-up on the 2XKO <a href="https://alpha.2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

                <p>Neil Druckmann is one of gaming's biggest names, and he's helped write and direct games in the critically and commercially successful franchises like The Last of Us and Uncharted. But Druckmann isn't always confident in what he's making while he's making it--with one exception.</p><p>During a speech at the DICE Summit recently attended by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/the-remarkable-banter-of-cory-barlog-and-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Druckmann said only with 2009's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves did he feel "confident" throughout the process. "Every other project where I was at the head of it, I was sure at many points that we were not going to succeed. You just have to power past that feeling," he said.</p><p>Part of what creates anxiety for Druckmann is the scope and scale of any given project, including staff and large budgets. "There's all this pressure," he said. "There's no formula for how to succeed. You can never guarantee success. All you can do is follow your instincts, follow the advice the team gives you, trust the process," he said.</p><p>The "process" for Naughty Dog is how the studios works together and vets ideas, Druckmann said, as well as iterating again and again.</p><p>"We know that our first idea is never the best one. We have to get to the seventh one to get something interesting, something unique. The first few, you've heard of it. It's something you've seen before," he said. "That's how you start to dig deeper. We know we’ll have to throw work away. That's part of our process. At times that can be frustrating for people, members of the team, ourselves. But going through it over and over again, that's how you get past your doubts. Doubt will always be there."</p><p>Druckmann also mentioned how having a schedule is critical to his working process, even if he might not personally enjoy sticking to a strict schedule. "I need it. The team needs it as well, because--it's not unique to me. It's just Naughty Dog. We're perfectionists. Without it we would just keep iterating," Druckmann said.</p><p>Druckmann is now directing Naughty Dog's new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while he may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us 3</a>. Beyond games, Druckmann worked alongside Craig Mazin on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-finally-sets-a-date-for-the-last-of-us-season-2/1100-6529601/" data-ref-id="1100-6529601">The Last of Us Season 2, which comes to HBO in April.</a></p>

                <p>Avowed was originally going to have multiplayer components, similar to that of Destiny where players could walk around in a massive world.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDE2MDg3MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwNzY1NjcyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUzFPT0xUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.FhUrXseBBb83k69Ovuo9PgY3sOuBdW-owuWeanAYc5o&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, director Carrie Patel said that Obsidian Entertainment pitched Avowed as a cross between Destiny and Skyrim to prospective buyers, which ended with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-acquires-fallout-new-vegas-star-wars-knights-/1100-6463175/" data-ref-id="1100-6463175">Microsoft purchasing the studio</a>. Avowed's development started in 2018 but went through two reboots, which led Obsidian to scrap its multiplayer component.</p><p>The second reboot occurred in January 2021, when Obsidian replaced Avowed's leadership as they were about to enter production. Patel initiated two major pivots to Avowed, the first of which was to focus on its story and lore from the Pillars of Eternity universe. The second was to replace Avowed's original open world with open-zone ones, similar to that of Obsidian's The Outer Worlds. The latter decision was made so that the development team could create more distinct and denser spaces.</p><p>As a result, the development team had to scale back in creating large and sprawling maps like Skyrim. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones' and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player’s going from one environment to the next," Patel explained.</p><p>Patel also said that the team is happy with Avowed's sales numbers so far. Although Patel wouldn't reveal what her team's next project is, we do know that Obsidian Entertainment is currently working on The Outer Worlds 2. Initially announced in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">Obsidian released its first gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a>. The game is set for release sometime this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Avowed is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/avowed-review/2300-6465692/" data-ref-id="2300-6465692">Avowed review</a>, we said, "Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential."</p>
