                <p dir="ltr">Ludeon Studios has released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rimworld/">RimWorld</a>: Odyssey, a massive new expansion for the sci-fi colony sim. This releases alongside a free 1.6 update that is also available to those who only own the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">Odyssey marks the sixth major expansion for RimWorld and includes a focus on exploration. Players will be able to build their own gravship to travel across the planet and explore new biomes, including the glowforest, the scarlands, the glacial plains, and the lava fields. These new biomes also introduces new landmarks, such as cliffs, fjords, and ancient structures where you can find more resources.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FutmQwQ-O2A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FutmQwQ-O2A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The gravship can also take you out of your planet and into space, where there are wrecked orbital platforms, derelict satellites and asteroids to explore and acquire more resources from, though you can expect some dangerous competition from space scavengers and killer mechanoids. You'll also need to ensure your gravship is prepared against the harsh conditions of space, from maintaining power to oxygen pumps to building airlocks to prevent deppressurization.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if you don't pick up the expansion, the Odyssey expansion releases alongside a free 1.6 update that brings with it a sweeping list of quality-of-life changes to the base game, such as a rework of map generation and giving winged animals the ability to fly, as well as performance improvements that will see launch times significantly reduced. A comprehensive list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRCjqVtPQDFGu4POiKTUd_8o3U2Asdhx99SOvcgU66ABdYtk3Cgndd53yJ6BC4tZX530pp_m6lf4Z9P/pub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">You can get the Odyssey expansion at a reduced price at Fanatical. RimWorld's base game is also available at a discount if you haven't yet experienced this complex sci-fi story generator.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> What Exactly Is Judas? | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p>Levine went on to say he doesn't want to "diss" developers who make those kinds of games, noting that they are expensive to make and companies want to see a return on investment. For Levine and his studio Ghost Story Games, the developer said he feels fortunate that company owner Take-Two gives the team freedom. "We're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'OK, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you,'" he said.</p><p>He also cited recent examples of games succeeding in the market that do not contain live-service and major online elements, mentioning titles like Baldur's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p>"These are games that are really traditional single-player games, and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audiences reward those games, especially in the AAA space because they can get so expensive that people want other methods of monetization," Levine said. "I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience."</p><p>Judas was announced years ago, but it still has no release date, or even a release window. The game is in the works for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>It's Levine's first project since BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013. In 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the game was originally targeting a 2017 release but has been stuck in "development hell." The report said Levine was given time and creative freedom to realize his vision for Judas, and this "lack of oversight seemed idyllic at first" but ultimately became "detrimental," developers said.</p><p>Mike Snight, who previously worked with Levine at Irrational Games and joined him at Ghost Story, said Levine is a "very hard person to work for." Snight, and half of the original team working on Judas, left the company during development. Levine was reported to have told staffers that the money Take-Two gave to Ghost Story amounted to a "rounding error" for the GTA company, and one analyst, Michael Pachter, said he believes Take-Two will give Levine all the time he needs.</p><p>As for the BioShock series, Take-Two's 2K division is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">producing a new BioShock game at Cloud Chamber</a>. Levine is not involved at all and the game has no release date.</p>

                <p>If you need a little sci-fi survival action, developer Creepy Jar has announced that its upcoming game StarRupture is about to get a three-day closed playtest. Between July 29-31, fans will be able to try out the single-player portion of this multiplayer title. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3dPFaGz00" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3D3dPFaGz00" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>StarRupture casts players as prisoners who have been sentenced to a penal colony world called Arcadia-7. But instead of being confined in a single physical building, the entire world is your prison and only the best can survive and endure in this harsh environment.</p><p>Fans can sign up for the playtest on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5DMXc4NkRhZFp4UFNTRGFkSlNGRTV2SzVFd3xBQ3Jtc0ttajRsTXFFdDBqQmM1TDBJMlpON0JNbTVNTWg3aTNiajJmdUNHNUdIUmpCMVJWNnQxTXpMQjhKbC1CMFBOOGZaOFJtbWZYUVctb2xqT09ybm9SaTR5bjJrRjZpb05nX3JBOXNIYWt5cWttVld2OGRxUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1631270%2FStarRupture%2F%3Futm_source%3DYT_playtest_announcement_video&amp;v=3D3dPFaGz00" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarRupture's Steam page</a>. When the co-op is active, up to four players can work together in this world. In the meantime, the single-player playtest will focus on letting players build bases and explore, and build up their survival and combat skills. Character progression will allow players to unlock new mods and new buildings. Additionally, players will be able to customize their abilities to match their play styles. </p><p>Players aren't entirely acting on their own. The corporations behind this penal planet have ordered everyone there to work on a factory and gather resources. The companies don't necessarily care whether players meet their end at the claws of some of the "bloodthirsty enemies" who are native to Arcadia-7.</p><p>StarRupture is expected hit early-access this fall.</p>
