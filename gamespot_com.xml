                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has shared more thoughts on AI, this time saying he believes the technology is here to stay and "we can't go back."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Kojima said, "Now there are so many people who can't live without their smartphones. AI is like that."</p><p>He added: "I think there isn't any point in saying 'We shouldn't use AI' or 'AI is useless.' We can't go back. Smartphones were the same."</p><p>What Kojima is saying lines up somewhat with the thoughts that Kingdom Come boss Daniel Vavra recently expressed about AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">He said</a>, "It's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kojima said AI might lead to changes in how people communicate, specifically saying it could help people with social anxiety to communicate better in face-to-face scenarios. At the same time, Kojima said people should be mindful of how much they use AI.</p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Kojima said people embrace, not fear, the further adoption of AI</a>. He said it can be helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-ai-could-shape-the-future-of-games-but-silent-hill-f-producer-strongly-disagrees/1100-6535623/" data-ref-id="1100-6535623">focus on more imaginative work.</a></p><p>Of course, not everyone agrees with Kojima, including a Silent Hill f producer who said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-ai-could-shape-the-future-of-games-but-silent-hill-f-producer-strongly-disagrees/1100-6535623/" data-ref-id="1100-6535623">AI won't be able to make "bold choices" that people can.</a> Lots of other people have also expressed a number of serious concerns about AI, including surrounding topics like job losses and the environmental impact of building out AI infrastructure, among other things.</p><p>Baldur's Gate and Divinity studio Larian recently caused a stir based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">CEO Swen Vincke's comments about AI</a>. The executive said essential context was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">"lost in translation"</a> and that he will answer questions on the topic in January.</p>

                <p>Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations</a>. After a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">quick retraction and explanation</a>, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?</p><p>According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/feature/concept-artists-in-games-say-generative-ai-references-only-make-their-jobs-harder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week In Video Games</a>, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively.</p><p>"I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. "It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way."</p><p>Another freelance designer and illustrator, Kim Hu, who worked as the lead artist on Rollerdrome (and possible the world's biggest fan of Marvel's Taskmaster), says even starting with AI images "robs you of discovery, as it will likely more or less give you exactly what you asked of it", and says that looking at the real world and references helps with creation and maybe adds on something you didn't think of before, "informing and branching out your ideas further." She adds that going down these accidental rabbit holes is a pivotal step in concept and world-building for her.</p><p>A senior concept artist, who asked to remain anonymous due to their position at a major game developer, told Tran that studio leadership now asks them to work from AI-generated reference material. They said that this often requires "reverse engineering where the pieces of the image composite came from, and working off what I'm able to find through careful searches on the internet--things like hairstyles, clothing, props, and so on."</p><p>Beyond protecting the company from potential legal risk, particularly given that the project involves a well-known IP, the artist said they feel a principled obligation to take on this extra work for the benefit of their colleagues. "When I'm putting a design package together for a 3D artist, either in-house or offsite, they need actual references they can use instead of wasting time deciphering what's in the output image 'references.' I feel responsibility for the others I work with on my projects--this is a normal part of my job."</p><p>AI implementation has polarized the industry, with some studio heads more than willing to move forward with it. Netflix was even looking for an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-hiring-a-new-genai-gaming-boss-with-a-huge-salary/1100-6535200/"> AI leader for its games department </a>over the fall, and at the beginning of the year, Microsoft invested $80 billion--while still admitting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">tech will lead to job losses</a>.</p>
