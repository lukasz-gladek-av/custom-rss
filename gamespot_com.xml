                <p dir="ltr">March has started off with a bang if you're still roaming the streets of Los Santos in GTA Online. Along with the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/">Enhanced Edition that arrived for PC players</a>, Rockstar Games also launched a new set of missions and released a plethora of additional content. The new missions fall under the name "Oscar Guzman Flies Again," and there are six of them in total. They take place at the infamous McKenzie Field Hangar and see you steal arms deliveries from Oscar's competition.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to get started with these missions and make some serious cash from the McKenzie Hangar, check out the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to start the Oscar Guzman Flies Again Missions in GTA Online</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453986"></a><figcaption>Oscar Guzman calling to tell us about his new idea</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453986-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.28.17.12.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, PC players need to ensure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">migrate their GTA Online character</a> correctly before attempting to pick up right where they left off after downloading the Enhanced Edition. This is easily done by selecting the GTA Online in the main menu and then following the prompts to migrate your character(s). This process is permanent, but there's no real reason you don't want to migrate your progress in either Online or Story Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">New players picking up GTA Online for the first time can simply download the Enhanced Edition and create a new character. However, if you're a new player, you'll have to go through a long slog of required tasks and missions before you're able to partake in the Oscar Guzman missions.</p><p dir="ltr">When you're in Los Santos, you can either go to MazeBank Foreclosures on your phone or wait for a call from Oscar Guzman. It's preferable to wait for Oscar to call you so he can properly explain what he wants you to do, but if you visit MazeBank Foreclosures, click on the red "McKenzie Field Hangar" box.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453984"></a><figcaption>Choosing to buy the McKenzie Field Hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453984-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.29.40.85.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From here, go to the northern side of Los Santos, find the property's blue icon, and elect to purchase the property for $1.475 million. If you wait for Oscar to call, he'll tell you to do the same thing, so you're buying the property regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">After McKenzie Field Hangar is purchased, you'll receive another call from Oscar who asks you to go visit the property. This is quite a drive from downtown Los Santos, but you can simply reload your server to instantly go to the location.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you arrive at the hangar, hop out inside and Oscar will greet you. He'll explain that he's happy you bought the property and goes over his plans for what you're going to do. After a brief conversation, you're led inside to the office where you can register as a CEO on the laptop on the desk. With that done, you can accept the first job in the Oscar Guzman Flies Again missions, which is called "Up and Running."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453985"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oscar Guzman at the hangar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4453985-gtavenhancedscreenshot2025.03.04-18.37.37.07.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You've now officially begun your first of six missions for Oscar Guzman in GTA Online. Up and Running doesn't take too long, but it can be difficult as a solo player, so if you have some friends or want to open up your party, that's recommended. However, all of the missions for Oscar Guzman can be completed solo.</p>
