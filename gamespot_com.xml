                <p>The Communications Workers of America, the union representing QA testers at ZeniMax, announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract with Microsoft. If implemented, this contract will be one of the first to go into effect at one of the big AAA game publishers.</p><p>Last month, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">voted to authorize a strike</a> in response to challenges to the contract negotiation process; this agreement would avoid a strike from being carried out. In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, CWA shared that the agreed contract would grant ZeniMax employees significantly increased protections and would raise pay across the board. It would also implement guidelines on the use of AI, restrict "arbitrary dismissal," and create processes to ensure that QA testers adequately receive credit in video games that they contribute to.</p><p>QA testing has been a hotspot of unionization efforts in the games industry, some of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/" data-ref-id="1100-6524209">have been targeted with union-busting efforts</a>. At ZeniMax, the QA testers' union represents around 300 employees and has been fighting for several years for this contract. In response to the agreement, Jessee Leese, a QA tester and union representative at ZeniMax, stated, "Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve."</p><p>In early 2023, ZeniMax employees created ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, a coalition of CWA units embedded in the company that was made possible under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-formally-agrees-to-recognize-activision-blizzard-union/1100-6504549/" data-ref-id="1100-6504549">Microsoft's neutrality agreement with union activism.</a> Since then, unionization has expanded at Microsoft to include more teams; earlier in May, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard announced that it has fully unionized</a>. There are now over 2,000 unionized employees at Microsoft.</p><p>This contract still needs to complete several hurdles before it can be fully implemented. Now that both parties have tentatively agreed, the union will hold a series of explanation sessions for its members to learn about its provisions. Then, in late June, CWA expects to hold a ratification vote among its members.</p><p><i>Disclosure: The author of this article is a member of CWA by way of a graduate student union. </i></p>

Some theorized that Activision did this on purpose to help prevent people from quitting lobbies if they noticed they were going up against a group of high-level players. But it turns out this was only a bug.</p><p>Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1928497479617597649" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates account</a> confirmed that the developer is investigating a bug that is causing player levels and level icons to fail to appear in lobbies. "Thank you for your reports! We are actively investigating this issue," Activision said on the game's <a href="https://trello.com/c/uAEvrBoF" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trello board.</a></p><p>Some of the other known issues for Black Ops 6 multiplayer include theater mode being temporarily disabled due to an issue loading replays, lobbies showing the wrong platform icon next to a player's name, and the Winner's Circle failing to appear in some cases on Stakeout. Another known issue is that players who call in a Dreadnought may get stuck in a state where they're unable to crouch or slide.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a> There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-the-overlook-safe-room-in-call-of-duty-warzone/1100-6531953/" data-ref-id="1100-6531953">numerous new updates for Warzone, too.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-infamous-riot-shield-returns-in-black-ops-6-but-not-how-you-think/1100-6531923/" data-ref-id="1100-6531923">Call of Duty's infamous riot shield has debuted in Black Ops 6 as a finishing move. </a> There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick / Ballerina crossover store bundle coming soon.</a></p><p>If you're keen to try Black Ops 6's new Season 4 content, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-free-on-xbox-this-weekend-for-season-4-launch/2900-6626/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6626">multiplayer is free right now for Xbox users. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><span>First revealed at </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/">2022's The Game Awards</a><span>, BioShock writer-director Ken Levine's upcoming narrative-driven RPG, </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/">Judas</a><span>, is still shrouded in mystery. Developed by Levine's new studio, Ghost Story Games, Judas was almost immediately labeled as "BioShock in space" by fans. But as the game's launch draws closer, it's become clear that although Judas certainly draws inspiration from the series that made Levine a household name, it's not just BioShock with a futuristic coat of paint. Judas has its own identity.</span></p><p dir="ltr">While the details are still relatively sparse, trailers, preview events, and developer interviews have painted a much clearer picture of what players can expect from Levine's latest creation. If you're interested in decoding this enigmatic RPG, keep scrolling for a breakdown of everything we know about Judas, from plot details to gameplay features and everything in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Judas_launch_">When does Judas launch?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas was originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creators-new-game-will-release-by-march-2025/1100-6511235/">slated for a March 2025 launch</a>, but March came and went without a peep from Levine and the developers at Ghost Story Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there is no official release date for Judas. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/" rel="nofollow ">game's Steam page</a> lists its release date as "coming soon." In a recent earnings report, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9a22a038-45bc-48df-8391-07705b355877" rel="nofollow ">Take-Two listed the game's launch date</a> as "to be announced."</p><h2 id="What_platforms_is_Judas_releasing_on_">What platforms is Judas releasing on?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><h2 id="What_is_Judas_about_">What is Judas about?</h2><p dir="ltr">The game's description on Steam reads, "A disintegrating starship. A desperate escape plan. You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke--or will you leave it to burn?"</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be stepping into the shoes of the aforementioned troubled protagonist, Judas. Judas is a woman who appears to live and work on a spaceship called The Mayflower. The Mayflower has recently suffered some sort of disaster, one that--based on the game's description--Judas herself is at least partially responsible for. Many areas of the ship have broken off, depressurized, or caught on fire, and the goal is clear: Survive, no matter the cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185"></a><figcaption>It seems that most (if not all) of the Mayflower's inhabitants are robotically augmented.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on the protagonist's biblical name, it's likely that betrayal is a major theme in the game's narrative, though it's not entirely clear if Judas herself is the betrayer or the one who has been betrayed. Interestingly, the game's trailers feature several shots of injured androids who look identical to humans with the exception of a glowing green circle on the back of their hands.</p><p dir="ltr">"The ship is… dying," a visibly injured Judas declares in the game's announcement trailer. "And my only way out of here is with one of <em>them."</em></p><p dir="ltr">Judas herself may, in fact, be an android, as gameplay footage shows her sporting the glowing green circle on the back of one hand and shooting Plasmid-like powers out of it. It's also possible Judas is actually a human who has been robotically augmented, a la Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist, V. But if that's the case, Judas has been <em>very</em> heavily augmented--another trailer clip shows her finishing off an enemy while floating around outside the damaged Mayflower … without any sort of suit to protect her body from the vacuum of open space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186"></a><figcaption>A calendar reveals the year is 1979, while text on the left side of the screen suggests Judas herself may be an AI-controlled robot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Time travel may also be a theme in the game's narrative, as another trailer features a quick jump-cut in which Judas can be seen near a wall calendar indicating that the year is 1979. This could also be an illusion, however, as some of Judas's statements in the trailer suggest that the game takes place in a world where thoughts are recorded by a Big Brother-esque entity, and false memories can be implanted into the station's robotically augmented inhabitants, Westworld-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Other shots in the game's trailers reference "The Big Three," a trio of characters who once controlled The Mayflower. The Big Three is made up of Hope, a young woman with pink hair and a childlike aesthetic; Nefertiti, a woman with strange mechanical abilities and an affinity for fashion; and Tom, a middle-aged man in a cowboy hat. It appears that these three characters are Judas's enemies, and players may have to choose which one Judas escapes the ship with.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm here to set you free," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-judas-trailer-at-state-of-play-shows-off-bioshock-like-combat/1100-6520723/">Judas states in one trailer</a> as she presses a button, ignoring the computer terminal's warnings that doing so will cause a catastrophic failure. "Whether you like it or not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183"></a><figcaption>Prior to the disaster, The Big Three seemed to be quite popular with The Mayflower's inhabitants.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game's trailers indicate it's expected to receive an M rating. According to the ESRB, M-rated games are "generally suitable for ages 17 and up," but "may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language."</p><h2 id="Judas_gameplay_details">Judas gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">While "BioShock in space" is a great elevator pitch, what we've seen from the game so far suggests that Judas is far from a BioShock clone. Yes, it's a narrative-driven first-person shooter RPG from the guy who made BioShock, and thus bears some resemblance to the BioShock series. But Judas also differs from Levine's previous work in many ways.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable difference between Judas and the BioShock series is the fact that Judas is a procedurally generated roguelite.</p><p dir="ltr">"We call it pseudo-procedural because it's not like Minecraft where everything's being generated off a set of pure mathematical heuristics," Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/">explained in an interview</a>. "You build all these smaller piece elements in the game and then you teach the game how to make good levels essentially, and [a] good story, and most importantly, [make it] reactive to what you do."</p><p dir="ltr">The Big Three appear to Judas as holograms, and her relationship with each of them will play a major role in the game's narrative. Doing a favor for one member of The Big Three will increase their affinity for Judas, but is likely to displease at least one of the other two members, and anger comes with consequences. If Judas upsets one member, they may get back at her by ratting her out to another member by revealing her plans or current location. It's clear that Judas' story design--especially when it comes to player choices--goes much deeper than BioShock's <em>very</em> binary "Will you save the Little Sisters, or are you a complete sociopath?" narrative choice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184"></a><figcaption>Judas can open the strange implant on her left hand to swap out abilities. When the hatch closes, it glows green.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for the game's "roguelite" elements, Levine says that death is an integral part of the game. Items that allow Judas to regain health are scarce, and enemies are everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">"You do have the opportunity when you die to go change yourself," Levine says.

                <p>Mario sports and racing games bring out the weirdest behaviors from the Mushroom Kingdom's zany characters, and Waluigi is a prime example of this. The animation team for Mario Kart World must have had a field day with Luigi's lanky nemesis, as displayed by video footage of a Mario Kart World demo capturing something that might be easy to miss during gameplay.</p><p>In a video on X posted by user <a href="https://x.com/misterduby/status/1928107524735025376" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mr. Duby</a>, Waluigi gets a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">Coin Block item</a>, which grants the player coins upon hitting it. But as seen in the video, Waluigi makes the unconventional decision to kick the Coin Block upwards.</p><p>It's a rather impractical, yet impressively flexible move. Say anything you want about Waluigi, but he's anything but boring. Traditionally, Mario and friends hit coin blocks with their fists, but Waluigi seems to want to go out of his way to showcase his impressive limberness.</p><p>And it's not just Waluigi who mines coins from blocks using an unexpected body part -- his buddy <a href="https://x.com/b0ssguy3000/status/1928142301911519454" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario straight up uses his derrière</a> to hit blocks. One has to wonder how Wario and Waluigi would approach the fairly standard action of hitting blocks if they were in a traditional Super Mario platformer.</p><p>Waluigi has always been characterized by quirky and expressive animations in the Mario spin-off games, from his romantic rose pose in Mario Party 8 to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGZaf-eb_yI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his shockingly crude celebration</a> in the Mario Strikers series. He might have missed the cut for Super Smash Bros., but at least the Mario sports games are blessed with his chaotic unpredictability.</p><p>Mario Kart World, poised as the killer app <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch game for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">wild cast that features background characters</a>, like Penguin from Super Mario 64, and limbless enemies that have no business of driving karts, such as Pokey. We'll have to see how they approach the challenge of hitting a coin block, and the internet will surely get a lot of fun GIFs out of those.</p>
