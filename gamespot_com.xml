                <p>Aggro Crab is at it again with another frenetic physics-based cooperative game. After taking the gaming world by storm with Peak, which Aggro Crab co-developed with Landfall, the studio has given a first look at its next title, a four-player forklift co-op game called Crashout Crew. A demo for the game will be available during this month's Steam Next Fest.</p><p>The announcement trailer showcases four players attempting to fulfill warehouse orders, driving unusually fast forklifts that drift and boost, yielding predictably hilarious results as they spin out and bounce around.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">welcome to üí•CRASHOUT CREWüí¢<br>form a crew of up to 4 overworked friends and drift into a frantic co-op forklift experience where teamwork is key, disaster is inevitable and managing stress is all on you.<br>DEMO drops Oct 13th as part of Steam Next Fest‚ÄºÔ∏è<br>it's time to clock tf in. <a href="https://t.co/xZFL9ezwPT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xZFL9ezwPT</a></p>  ‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3583210/view/524229329545071235?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Community post</a>, Aggro Crab describes the warehouse as a "full-blown raceway" in which players aim to fulfill contracts that have unique and unusual boxes to ship. The trailer shows off a couple of examples, such as fragile eggs that will break if run over and crates filled with bees that will unleash a swarm if mishandled.</p><p>The Steam Next Fest demo, playable from October 13-20, will feature three of these contracts, which can be modified with "safety violations" to add layers of difficulty. Crashout Crew has a broad 2026 release window.</p><p>Aggro Crab began work on both Crashout Crew and Peak after canceling a sequel to the studio's dungeon-crawler roguelike Going Under. While some at Aggro Crab worked on Peak with Landfall, the rest of the studio "locked in" on Crashout Crew, which was conceptualized at a game jam.</p><p>So fret not, Peak fans, as Aggro Crab promises that Peak is still receiving updates. Last month, the climbing co-op game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peaks-latest-patch-brings-major-fixes-and-color-blindness-mode/1100-6534562/" data-ref-id="1100-6534562">received some major fixes</a>, most notably a colorblindness mode, and a recent update even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/" data-ref-id="1100-6535123">added activities to the airport lobby</a>.</p>

During the conversation, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hosted on Dring's The Game Business Show website and podcast</a>, the two discussed Battlefield 6's highly successful beta--which attracted an estimated 25 million players, surpassed 2.4 million Steam wishlists, and has 1.7 million Steam preorders. These figures, according to van Dreunen and London-based market researchers Ampere Analysis, suggest that Battlefield 6 could absolutely dominate at launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"However, Battlefield 6 clearly has huge momentum," Dring wrote. "Ampere believes the game will sell five million units in its first week, and the excitement for the game is growing as we near its October 10 launch. It's pretty much guaranteed a big day one, and if it can deliver a strong start, that will likely have a knock-on effect on Call of Duty (which arrives over a month later)."</p><p>For reference, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/12/03/insider-battlefield-2042-reportedly-sells-over-4-million-copies-in-first-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reports suggest</a> that 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2024</a> sold 4.23 million units within its first week.</p><p>Call of Duty and Battlefield are fairly different beasts, with the former focusing mostly on smaller engagements and direct firefights while the latter is known for its enormous maps and blend of infantry and vehicular combat. However, they nevertheless fight for a similar audience, and we've often seen them matched up against each other during the fall gaming blitz. Perhaps the most notable was in 2011, which saw the release of Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3. </p><p>Battlefield 6 had a couple of betas in August, which were apparently so optimized that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/many-battlefield-6-fans-played-beta-using-minimum-specs-says-ea/1100-6534385/" data-ref-id="1100-6534385">according to EA</a>, many players jumped into the military-shooting action with minimum PC specs. And now that we're a week away from the game's full launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-pre-loading-on-xbox-is-live-now/1100-6535142/" data-ref-id="1100-6535142">you can pre-load the game on PlayStation and Xbox right now</a>.

                <p>Unlike the previous two entries in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy that launched exclusively for PlayStation consoles--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S versions</a> on the way--the third game will adopt a multiplatform release strategy. This means that Square Enix will be developing for multiple consoles and PC for a wide release, but the company doesn't expect this approach to hinder production on the game.</p><p>"We do have designated teams working on each platform so that our multiplatform approach won't impact the development whatsoever," Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi said to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZB4XGfyLrTo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Easy Allies</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). Hamaguchi did acknowledge that Square Enix was facing some challenges with bringing Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth to Xbox Series X|S, suggesting that a "lack of memory" was to blame.</p><p>"As for the Xbox version, like many other publishers, I think we did see some issues with the lack of memory compared with other platforms," Hamaguchi said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB4XGfyLrTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZB4XGfyLrTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Talking about the upcoming Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Hamaguchi sounded confident about the progress being made, with Square Enix engineers working on optimizing the game for the Nintendo console's docked and handheld modes while also focusing on the lighting to improve the overall graphical quality.</p><p>While a release date for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S hasn't been revealed yet, the first game in the saga, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, will launch for both consoles on January 22. One of the new features here will be a progression boost that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-ridiculously-easy-mode-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6534874/">makes the game ridiculously easy to play</a>, and it'll be added to the PC and PS5 versions via a future update.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is also currently in development</a>, and despite Rebirth's disappointing sales, Hamaguchi said the saga will conclude with a "proper, high-quality" finale. It hasn't been formally revealed yet, but Final Fantasy producer Tetsuya Nomura recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-reveal-date-already-decided-says-nomura/1100-6534518/">Square Enix knows exactly when it will officially reveal</a> the game.</p>
