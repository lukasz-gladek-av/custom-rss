                <p>Bandai Namco confirmed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</a> is officially headed to the Switch 2 and Switch during Nintendo's July Partner Direct. These new Switch and Switch 2 versions will play just like the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, but will add support for motion controls for certain moves, such as Goku's Spirit Bomb ultimate attack. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will be available on Switch 2 and Switch in multiple versions, including a $60 physical standard edition and multiple digital editions that include tons of extra content, all of which are available to preorder now ahead of Sparking Zero's November 14 release date. Preordering any edition of the game on either of Nintendo's hybrid handhelds also unlocks several of the game's characters early.</p><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg"></figure><p>If you preorder Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero on either Switch 2 or Switch, you'll get Goku's child form from the most recent Dragon Ball anime, Dragon Ball Daima, as a bonus playable character. You'll also get early unlocks for six variations of Gogeta (the fused form of Goku and Vegeta) and Broly--but that's still a nice head start on unlocking the game's full 182-character roster. Here's a list of all the preorder bonus characters for the Switch 2 and Switch versions:</p><ul><li>Goku (Mini)</li><li>Gogeta (Base form)</li><li>Gogeta (Super Saiyan)</li><li>Gogeta (Super Saiyan Blue)</li><li>Broly (Base form)</li><li>Broly (Super Saiyan)</li><li>Broly (Legendary Super Saiyan)</li></ul><div title="6533637 -- Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Switch Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4018" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533637 -- Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Switch Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero standard edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases November 14</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Switch 2 and Switch editions of Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero include the base game, plus the bonus and early character unlocks if you preorder ahead of launch. Physical preorders are available for $60 at multiple online retailers. Digital preorders are also available on the Switch eShop.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Switch 2 edition is a Game-Key Card release, meaning the cartridge does not include any of the game data, and instead works as physical DRM that allows you to download and play the digital version on your console. The original Switch version includes the full game data on the cart. It does not look like Bandai Namco is offering the option to upgrade from the Switch to Switch 2 edition. It's also uncertain how the game will perform on the original Switch, but Bandai Namco confirms that the more-powerful hardware of the Switch 2 will naturally offer better graphical power. </p></div>                      </div><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</h2><h4>$90 | Releases November 14</h4><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the physical standard edition, Sparking Zero will also get two digital-only Switch 2 and Switch versions that include additional content.

The game is a celebration of the entire Dragon Ball franchise, featuring a roster of 182 characters from various Dragon Ball anime series and movies. In addition to the single-player campaign that spans multiple Dragon Ball sagas, there's also a mode that lets you change the outcome of notable moments from the series. The game also includes online and local multiplayer for up to six players.</p><p>There are several other great Dragon Ball games available for Switch, all of which are also backwards compatible with the Switch 2. If you're looking for another fighting game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dragon Ball FighterZ is a superb entry in the genre</a>. Developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2.5D tag-team fighting game with a roster of characters pulled from Dragon Ball Z, GT, and Super. However, it offers a more traditional fighting game compared to the three-dimensional action of Sparking Zero. You can pick it up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>For a story-focused single-player Dragon Ball experience, there's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>. The game retells the entire Dragon Ball Z story of Goku, but it adds an action-RPG flair with an enjoyable grind and skill customization as you explore the anime's iconic world. The game has also received several post-launch expansions that adapt other Dragon Ball storylines, including Dragon Ball Super and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Daima</a>. Finally, there's also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a>, which allows you to create your own custom character and team up with Goku and the other Z Warriors to protect all of time and space. While it is an older game in the series, Xenoverse 2 has been supported constantly with new DLC over the years, and its roster is up to date with modern Dragon Ball media.</p><h2>More Dragon Ball Games on Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> -- $32.45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot: Daima Edition</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> -- $25 (<strike>$30</strike>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chonicles-preorder-amazon-exclusive-edition-switch-2-playstation/1100-6532119/">Final Fantasy Tactics Remake Has Free Nintendo Switch 2 Upgrade</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-one-piece-netflix-anime-all-building-sets-available-now/1100-6532155/">Lego One Piece - Going Merry Ship &amp; Six Other Sets Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> was released out of early and quickly became one of the most popular RPG games of this generation. Now, Larian Studios is sharing some of the rare choices and other stats that it has compiled from players' choices during the last two years.</p><p>Only 2.07% of all players managed to beat 20 opponents while drunk, and 1.82% of players earned 100 gold from performing music. Larian posted several <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">infographics on the Steam page</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, including the fact that 3.87% of players beat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. And half a million players have completed the game in Honor mode, compared to 1.1 million players who beat the game in Tactician mode. Out of the Honor mode players, only 4,647 players beat it with a level 1 character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896"></a><figcaption>If it's a popularity contest, Shadowheart has already won.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg"></figure><p>When it came time to pick the most-respecced companions, the outcome wasn't a surprise. Shadowheart led the way with 4,890,005 players, who were apparently evenly split between using her as a Life Cleric or a Death Cleric. Wyll was the second-most respecced companion with 1,417,506 players, while Gale finished in third with 684,454 players.</p><p>For some truly obscure choices, only 350 players respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, and there were 598 players who adopted a child with Wyll. According to Larian, the studio is also going to expand the official toolkit for mods. Over 8,500 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3 mods</a> have been created since September 2024 with over 265 million mod downloads.</p><p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke recently thanked Baldur's Gate 3 players for their support and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-ceo-reflects-on-two-years-of-baldurs-gate-3-and-teases-the-studios-next-crazy-thing/1100-6533660/" data-ref-id="1100-6533660">briefly teased the studio's next game</a>.
