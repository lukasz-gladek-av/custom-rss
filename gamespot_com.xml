                <p>Devolver Digital has released its latest annual investor report, and included in the document is some commentary surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://investors.devolverdigital.com/files/downloads-and-publications/DEVO-FY24-Investor-Presentation.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devolver said</a> the original Switch is the company's most popular console platform, with more than 9 million units sold of its various games (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/47478-devolver-digital-s-games-are-most-successful-on-switch-selling-over-9-million-copies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GoNintendo</a>). Given that, Devolver said it sees an "opportunity" with the Switch 2. The company also called out how the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Direct</a> event featured three Devolver games: Starseeker, Human Fall Flat 2, and Enter the Gungeon 2.</p><p>Some of Devolver's games that have come to Switch over the years have included Hotline Miami, Always Sometimes Monsters, The Talos Principle, Reigns: Three Kingdoms, and The Plucky Squire.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set for release on June 5. Many are wondering if Nintendo will raise the price of the console due to Trump's controversial tariffs, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Switch 2 preorders were supposed to open on April 9, but Nintendo delayed them due to the tariffs. The company has yet to confirm a new start-date for preorders in the US, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">it could be soon. </a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">GameSpot's hands-on preview of the Switch 2</a> and its marquee launch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Over a year after its August 2023 launch date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is still being updated, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-massive-patch-8-update-is-coming-april-15-with-12-new-subclasses/1100-6530820/">its latest (and last major) patch</a> is one of its biggest--and arguably best--updates yet. Patch 8 is live now on all platforms, and introduces several long-awaited features to the game, including cross-platform play, photo mode, and a total of 12 new subclasses to give players more room to tinker with their Tav's build.</p><p dir="ltr">The excitement around photo mode is pretty self-explanatory--with a game as visually stunning as Baldur's Gate 3, it seemed almost criminal to launch the game with no photo mode. But the days of awkwardly trying to snap a good shot mid-cutscene are over. Now, players can take a photo at any time, even during combat. Larian even celebrated the patch's release with an animated (and fully voiced) short featuring all of the game's companion characters, along with an animated version of Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To activate photo mode, press F9 (PC) or press L3 + R3 at the same time (console). This will pause the game and bring up the photo mode menu, where players can change which characters are visible, choose from a number of facial expressions and body poses, add filters and frames, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">As for cross-play, players can now start up a multiplayer campaign with other players, regardless of what platform they're playing on. Players intending to use mods in a cross-play multiplayer campaign will want to make sure all players in the party have the same mods installed, but otherwise, there are no restrictions. (Though it's worth keeping in mind that some mods may be temporarily broken after the update, and will need to be deactivated until their creators update them to be compatible with Patch 8.)</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the game's 12 new subclasses, there's truly something for everyone, as each major class now has one additional subclass to choose from. Players that have already chosen a subclass can always hit up Withers to respec and choose a new one. The new subclasses are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barbarian:</strong> Path of Giants</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bard:</strong> College of Glamour</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cleric:</strong> Death Domain</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Druid:</strong> Circle of Stars</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fighter:</strong> Arcane Archer</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Monk:</strong> Drunken Master</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Paladin:</strong> Oath of the Crown</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ranger:</strong> Swarmkeeper</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rogue:</strong> Swashbuckler</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Shadow Magic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warlock:</strong> Hexblade</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wizard:</strong> Bladesinger</li></ul><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138" rel="nofollow ">Larian's blog post</a> detailing the patch's contents, Patch 8 will be the last major update to Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p dir="ltr">"Outside of minor bug fixing, Patch 8 will be the last game patch to introduce new content," the post reads. "That means we won't be adding any new narrative content or significant changes to storylines, Origin characters, or companions. We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we’re continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the start, your feedback has been incredibly important to us, and will continue to shape our future projects. As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project.</p><p dir="ltr">"From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-baldurs-gate-3-patch-improves-kissing/1100-6520967/">new ways to make out</a> with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes/2900-5753/">your most evil runs</a>, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the game's final update are listed in full below.</p><h2>Patch #8 Notes:</h2><p>Along with the new additions, Patch 8 also tackles a range of bugs, like fixing Shadowheart’s penchant for hair dye while skinny dipping, Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region, and we’ve resolved an issue with the moving platform in the Gauntlet of Shar that has accidentally proven harder to survive than, well, the actual Gauntlet of Shar.</p><p><em><strong>SPOILERS - Please bear in mind some of the entries below might contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk</strong></em></p><h2>HIGHLIGHTS</h2><ul><li>Photo Mode</li><li>12 brand new subclasses – one for each class, including: Path of the Giant Barbarian, College of Glamour Bard, Death Domain Cleric, Circle of Stars Druid, Arcane Archer Fighter, Way of the Drunken Master Monk, Oath of the Crown Paladin, Swarmkeeper Ranger, Swashbuckler Rogue, Shadow Magic Sorcerer, Hexblade Warlock, and Bladesinging Wizard</li><li>Cross-play</li><li>Xbox Series S split screen</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.</li><li>Fixed an issue where picking up items from the ground in multiplayer could then block movement via the controller stick.</li><li>Fixed the Wild Shape: Panther's Prowl action and Prowling condition not working correctly.</li><li>When you succeed a Perception check, the spotted item will now ping on the minimap and be listed in the combat log.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the special abilities of some of your allies weren't properly provided at the end of the dialogue with them at High Hall.</li><li>Scrolls and potions inside unlocked containers in your party inventory can now be used when rolling in dialogues.</li><li>Neutral and friendly NPCs will no longer become hostile when, outside of combat, they walk into surfaces created during combat that trigger passives (like electrified surfaces triggering Thunderbolt Strike).

This fix prevents the bug from happening in new playthroughs.</li><li>Fixed a bug where if you killed Gekh, then used Glut's Animating Spores to resurrect him, then dismissed Glut, both Spore Servant Gekh and Glut could become hostile towards you. It would also cause Gekh to try to stop you from using the raft to cross the lake.</li><li>Fixed multiple Oath of Vengeance dialogue options not appearing in Act I dialogues.</li><li>Fixed a bug allowing Glut to travel outside the Underdark if you used a waypoint from within the camp.

                <p dir="ltr">For some, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II set a surprisingly high difficulty bar right from the start of the game. However, Warhorse Studio clearly had more tricks up its sleeve, as today's Patch 1.2.4 update brings a new Hardcore mode to the table for the most dedicated of KCD2 players.</p><p dir="ltr">Hardcore Mode, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-hardcore-mode-arrives-next-week/1100-6530705/">revealed earlier this month</a>, adds multiple new obstacles to Henry of Skalitz's adventure, including the removal of fast travel and a list of negative perks that must be selected before the game begins.
