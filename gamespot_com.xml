                <p>You can now beam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-survivors/" data-ref-id="5000-544864">Vampire Survivors</a> directly into your eyeballs, as developer Poncle's indie-bullet-hell sensation is out now on a new platform: VR.</p><p dir="ltr">More specifically, it's available for the Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2, with a new trailer inviting players to "be the bullet hell, on your face."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDAAEYBvq3E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDAAEYBvq3E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of Vampire Survivors will come with two of the game's DLC expansions, Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari, built in. Both expansions add additional stages, characters, weapons, and enemies for players to experiment with. <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/vampire-survivors-vr/7991347610955592/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Survivors VR</a>, as a result, sports a slightly higher price tag of $10, compared to $5 on platforms like Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">Other than that, Vampire Survivors VR looks to be exactly the game players have come to know and love. Equip multiple weapons, level up, collect gold, purchase upgrades, and see how long you can last against the vampiric hordes. It's an appealing formula for a reason, and one that has been copied by numerous other games since Vampire Survivors first released in 2021 but doesn't make the original any less special.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking for their next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-vampire-survivors/2900-7118/" data-ref-id="2900-7118">Survivors-style game</a>, Poncle is working alongside developer Auroch Digital on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-survivors-announced-and-its-basically-grimdark-vampire-survivors/1100-6535908/" data-ref-id="1100-6535908">Warhammer Survivors</a>. The game will use the Vampire Survivors engine but feature enemies, weapons, and worlds from both the Warhammer fantasy and Warhammer: 40,000 sci-fi universes. Warhammer Survivors is slated to release in 2026 on PC.</p>

                <p>Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, best known for creating the landmark battle royale game PUBG, outlined an ambitious plan for his development studio to produce three ambitious titles, including one that aims to support 100v100-player multiplayer matches.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-planning-a-new-multiplayer-fps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Greene detailed the roughly 10-year plan for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-new-game-sort-of-revealed-at-the-gam/1100-6472202/" data-ref-id="1100-6472202">his studio, which was established in 2019</a> and is simply called PlayerUnknown Productions. The first game from the development team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">Prologue: Go Wayback, a single-player survival roguelike</a> that tasks you with navigating worlds generated through machine-learning technology. It'll be available in early access starting November 20. Greene has stated in the past that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-thinks-players-will-initially-hate-his-next-game/1100-6529642/" data-ref-id="1100-6529642">expects players to hate the game at first</a>.</p><p>The second planned game from the studio "aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told Eurogamer. Describing the untitled project as "more of an FPS/RTS mix," the game would test terrain generation, NPC interactions, and network protocols on large scales.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuQvsF_qovw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zuQvsF_qovw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, the studio's third game would be a more creative title, taking concepts from the first two games and allowing players to "create their own planets" for various uses, like a player-created FPS game, for example.</p><p>At this time, the second game exists as "general high-level plans," but it will use PlayerUnknown Productions' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_CkGSUzBOE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proprietary engine Melba</a>, which uses machine-learning tools (otherwise known as AI) to create Earth-like planets in real time.</p><p>According to Greene, the studio has "a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two" with the expectation of working on it for "another two, three, four years, maybe longer." Greene described the larger three-game project as a 10-year plan.</p><p>Greene has been far removed from PUBG: Battlegrounds for some time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-leaves-krafton-to-form-new-studio/1100-6495802/" data-ref-id="1100-6495802">leaving PUBG developer Krafton in 2021</a> to focus on his new projects.</p><p>Large-scale multiplayer projects like Greene's proposed title are a rarity these days; battle royales generally have 60 to 120 players on the same map, while modern shooters like Battlefield 6 only support up to 64 players max in a match. Old-school PlayStation 3 players might remember MAG, which supported 128v128 matches, but PlayerUnknown Productions' game certainly has different technical ambitions with its world generation.</p>
