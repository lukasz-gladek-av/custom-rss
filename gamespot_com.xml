                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> is generally one of the best times of the year to <a href="https://amzn.to/44mok5x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy an Amazon device</a>, including the retailer's popular Kindle ereaders. It's also the perfect time to try Kindle Unlimited, the ebook subscription service that lets readers borrow and instantly download up to 20 ebooks at once.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's early Prime Day 2025 sale</a>, Prime members can get their <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first three months of Kindle Unlimited for free</a></strong>. Former members should also check their eligibility, as Amazon sometimes lets you take advantage of new subscriber promotions if it's been a while since you canceled your membership. </p><p dir="ltr">Kindle Unlimited costs $12/month, so the freebie is worth $36. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-amazon-prime-day-2025-sale/1100-6532476/" data-ref-id="1100-6532476">Prime Day 2025 is slated for July 8-11</a>, but this promotion and the retailer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/audible-premium-plus-free-audiobooks-prime-day-deal/1100-6524536/" data-ref-id="1100-6524536">Audible Premium Plus deal</a> are available through July 31.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Kindle Unlimited includes access to over four million ebooks, digital comics, manga, and magazines in Amazon's library. Many titles even come with free audiobook versions that are automatically added to your Audible library and can be listened to on smartphones, tablets, and computers.</p><p dir="ltr">After the free trial is over, your account will automatically roll over to the normal $12/month payment plan, but you're free to cancel at any time if you don't want to stick with the service. Amazon doesn't say how long this offer will be available, so Prime members should <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">redeem the deal</a> while it's still available.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not already a Prime Member, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up now</a> for $15/month or $139/year, and then immediately redeem this Kindle Unlimited offer. If you're a student or 18-24 years old, you can get half-off those prices, dropping the monthly cost to $7.49 and the annual membership to $69. And if you're new to Prime, you won't have to pay for your first month--or six months, if you are eligible for the Prime Young Adult membership.</p><p dir="ltr">Prime members also get a bunch of other benefits, including free Prime shipping, access to Prime Video and Prime Music streaming libraries, monthly downloadable PC games, exclusive discounts, and more.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you love books, make sure you also check out Amazon's Audible deal before it expires. Prime members can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get Audible Premium Plus for free for three months ($45 value)</a></strong>. The Audible offer is arguably even more noteworthy, as the Premium Plus tier includes one free book of your choosing each month. Even if you decide to cancel before the three-month trial ends, you can keep books purchased with Audible credits. This essentially means Amazon Prime members can get three free audiobooks from a vast catalog that includes new releases and preorders.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of freebies, Prime Gaming is giving away <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-can-grab-six-more-free-games-this-month/1100-6532477/" data-ref-id="1100-6532477">a handful of free PC games</a> ahead of Prime Day 2025.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-preorder-guide-amazon-exclusive-edition-bonuses-release-date/1100-6532712/">Little Nightmares 3 Amazon-Exclusive Mirror Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-limited-edition/1100-6530625/">A Minecraft Movie's Limited Edition Steelbook Is In Stock On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-collector-edition-launch-buying-guide/1100-6530003/">Death Stranding 2 Collector's Edition Is In Stock Ahead Of Tomorrow's Launch</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>MindsEye launched earlier this month but didn't come out of the gate in a great state, with players encountering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/" data-ref-id="1100-6532343">range of problems, bugs, and other issues</a>. Actor Alex Hernandez, who plays main character Jake Diaz, has now commented on the game's buggy release, offering up his take on what might have happened.</p><p>Speaking to Check It TV, Hernandez he believes developer Build a Rocket Boy decided to launch MindsEye with issues with a plan to fix them after launch.</p><p>"It's not a lack of QA. I met the QA testers and they seemed competent at their job. But for whatever reason, the company decided to release something that has these issues and then taking care of it post-release... obviously we were not the first game to do that," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxfAyV7XBTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxfAyV7XBTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hernandez said Cyberpunk 2077 is an example of another game that launched in a rough state and was then improved over time with updates.</p><p>Hernandez went on to say that he "doesn't love" the model of a developer selling a game for full price with issues at launch and then fixing it over time.</p><p>"I don't love that model," he said. "I'm not a business person. I have no idea why that decision gets made. I will just say that from a consumer perspective, and I am sure a lot of people feel this way, I think it does more long-term harm than good to your reputation to release something that feels like it is in a state of less-than 100%, and then charge 100% of the price."</p><p>Additionally, Hernandez said he would rather see developers embrace an early-access model where the developer is up-front with players about issues so that fans know what they are signing up for.</p><p>Just ahead of the release of MindsEye, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">pair of senior executives left the developer</a>, while Build a Rocket Boy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/" data-ref-id="1100-6532630">said to be cutting staff following the game's release.</a> The game was published by Hitman studio IO Interactive.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is headed up by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar Games veteran. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> scored the game a 3/10. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings. If you're looking for quality, cast your mind's eye elsewhere," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p>
