                <p>Last month, the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titan-quest-2-early-access-will-begin-this-summer/1100-6531406/">Titan Quest 2 arrived in early access on PC</a>, and according to THQ Nordic, it sold 300,000 copies in just its first three days. While reacting to that news, former THQ vice president of studio operations Richard Browne shared a few of the reasons why Titan Quest 2 wasn't released almost two decades ago.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7358661819734921216/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%2C7358864581047341056%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287358864581047341056%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%29" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/09/03/former-thq-vice-president-the-development-of-titan-quest-2-was-first-approved-19-years-ago-but-it-was-halted-due-to-marketing-issues-and-the-lead-game-designer-not-being-pr-friendly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game World Observer</a>), Browne noted that THQ had given the greenlight for the sequel in 2006. However, the development team at Iron Lore Entertainment couldn't get past THQ's marketing department, which rejected the proof-of-concept demo.</p><p>"[Titan Quest] was one of those games that just sold and sold; but our marketing department didn't see it," wrote Browne. "We had a great 360 demo with the camera lower and controlled--they nixed it using 'Emsense' to show that the demo (three months work) didn't resonate."</p><p>Emsense utilized sensors that monitored players' heart rate, breath rate, and other factors to measure their response to a given product. Because Titan Quest 2 didn't get a favorable response through Emsense, that was one of the justifications for shelving the project.</p><p>Browne also mentioned that the marketing team wasn't eager to work with the game's lead designer, Brian Sullivan, whom they considered as "not being PR friendly."</p><p>"Brian was great," recalled Browne. "He [was just] a khaki shorts, black socks, and loafers kinda [guy] and that made their job hard."</p><p>Titan Quest 2 eventually ended up in development under Grimlore Games for THQ Nordic. The sequel is currently only available on PC during its early access period. But the game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>

                <p>One of the most-anticipated upcoming features for the soccer game Rematch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play support</a>, has been delayed. Developer Sloclap announced today that the update has been pushed to an unspecified point in the future after the team discovered an issue. The patch was set to be released this week, so the last-minute delay is frustrating some fans.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1963629952139424001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Sloclap said its "final tests" found a "major matchmaking issue" related to cross-play, and that's why it's delaying the update.</p><p>"Since cross-play is the heart of Patch 3, we've decided to delay the release while we fix it. We know this is disappointing and we're truly sorry for the repeated delays. Thank you for your patience and support. We'll share a new update as soon as we have more news," the developer said.</p><p>This is actually a second delay for the cross-play update, as Sloclap was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-patch-notes-detail-whats-new-cross-play-update-coming-soon/1100-6533965/" data-ref-id="1100-6533965">originally aiming to launch it by the end of August.</a></p><p>In addition to cross-play, Patch 3 for Rematch will make some gameplay changes, including tweaks to the volley system. "This will also remove certain situations in which players seemed to be moving very fast towards their volley target, which felt both unrealistic and unfair," the developer said</p><p>Additionally, Patch 3 reduces the power boost that stems from the aerial extra effort volley shot.</p><p>Rematch launched in June and reached more than 5 million players after a month, but the $30 game hasn't necessarily sold that many copies, as it's also available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>. The game takes place decades in the future and there are no fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, ties, or shootouts.</p>

                <p>Players can finally get their hands on the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and with its launch also comes the release of the game's soundtrack.</p><p>Composer Christopher Larkin shared the link to the soundtrack, which is <a href="https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-silksong-original-soundtrack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to purchase on Bandcamp</a> for $11.99. The Silksong soundtrack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928720/Hollow_Knight_Silksong__Official_Soundtrack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also for sale on Steam</a> at the same price, but users can buy both the game (normally $20) and the soundtrack at a discounted $25.58.</p><p>The Silksong soundtrack contains 53 tracks, compared to the original Hollow Knight soundtrack, which included 26 tracks. Another music release titled "Hollow Knight: Gods &amp; Nightmares" had 15 tracks from the original game's DLC. That's all to say that Silksong has a larger soundtrack than both the original game and its DLC combined.</p><p>Both the Hollow Knight soundtrack and the Gods &amp; Nightmares release are also streaming on Spotify and Apple Music, though there has been no official word at this time about any streaming debut for the Silksong soundtrack. The original Hollow Knight soundtrack even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Original-Soundtrack-Limited/dp/B07RWDS264?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">received a vinyl record release</a>, which is still available.</p><p>Larkin also composed the music for the original Hollow Knight and its DLC. His video game discography also includes the soundtracks for Pac-Man 256, Outfolded, and the upcoming Moonlighter 2. As described on <a href="https://composerlarkin.com/portfolio-item/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Larkin's personal website</a>, the Silksong musical score "extend[s] on the established musical world of Hollow Knight from soft melancholic pieces to soul thumping, heart racing boss themes and beyond."</p><p>Of course, fans can also hear this music through playing the game itself, which they certainly are, as the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-big-launch/1100-6534482/" data-ref-id="1100-6534482">reached high concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>. The explosive launch of the game even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">caused technical issues</a> for the Steam, PSN, Xbox, and Nintendo eShop stores.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
