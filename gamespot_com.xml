                <p>The Switch 2 launched on June 5 and sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">3.5 million units worldwide out of the gate</a>, but how did it perform in the US specifically? Mat Piscatella of Circana <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared</a> that the system is projected to have sold 1.3 million-1.35 million units during its first week in the US. That's only Circana's initial projection of sales, but Piscatella said it represents a "helluva great start" for the console.</p><p>Piscatella shared other statistics like how 79% of people who bought a Switch 2 also obtained a copy of Mario Kart World, either through the $500 Switch 2 bundle or by purchasing the $80 game outright.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The top three best-selling Switch 2 physical games sold during the first week in the US were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 Edition, according to Circana. Mario Kart World has big shoes to fill, as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold 68.2 million units, with Mario Kart 8 shifting 8.46 million copies for a combined total of 76.66 million.</p><p>Finally, Piscatella said the Switch 2 set a new all-time record for first-week sales of video game hardware in the US, surpassing a record previously held by the PS4. Globally, the Switch 2 is the fastest-selling console in history.</p><p>While the Switch 2's sales at launch proved to be strong, there are some who believe the console will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-wont-sell-as-well-as-original-due-in-part-to-backward-compatibility-analyst/1100-6530136/" data-ref-id="1100-6530136">fail to sell as well as the original Switch over time</a>, due to a variety of factors.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-wednesday/1100-6532446/" data-ref-id="1100-6532446">In other news, the </a>next Nintendo Direct is coming up on June 18, and it's focused on an iconic Nintendo franchise.

                <p>This week, Sifu developer Sloclap is releasing Rematch, a new futuristic soccer title that takes a fresh approach to the game known as football outside of the United States. However, fans who want to field challengers from all platforms will have to wait, because Sloclap has announced that cross-play won't be ready in time for Rematch's launch.</p><p>Sloclap shared the news on social media, but also assured players that adding cross-play in a future update remains a priority for the team. The dev didn't put a timetable on when cross-play features will be ready.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch, but it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! ⚽🎮<br>We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rematch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rematch</a></p>  — Rematch (@PlayRematch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rematch embraces a semi-arcade style by cutting soccer teams down to five teammates on each side. Players are only in control of a single team member, but other players can either join their side or play against them on the opposing team.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFMw23F-KbA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EFMw23F-KbA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Because the game is set 40 years in the future, it offers some fundamental changes to the way soccer is played. Fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, draws, and shoot-outs are a thing of the past, and the ball is never out of play because the entire game takes place inside a cage. Players' POV of the game is shown through a third-person camera. In addition to 5v5 matchups, there are also options for 3v3 and 4v4 battles.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-online-5v5-soccer-game-had-me-sweating-from-the-pressure/1100-6530784/" data-ref-id="1100-6530784">GameSpot's hands-on preview</a> for Rematch praised the way that it makes the game feel like an intense team sport. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers will be able to try out Rematch for themselves on Xbox Series X|S on day one, June 19.

This doesn't include the players on the Epic Games Store, where Stellar Blade is also available for purchase.</p><p>As noted by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, Stellar Blade is doing very well in China, thanks to the Chinese dub of the game and it being priced much cheaper there.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of PC sales from China thanks to Chinese dub (not on console) and regional pricing ($38 vs $60)</p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=275&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up also confirmed</a> that Stellar Blade has sold over 1 million units in just three days, and with PS5 sales combined, this brings the grand total of sales up to 3 million so far. The game has also been fine-tuned since launch, and it has received two major expansion packs as well.</p><p>The first one saw it cross over with what is arguably its biggest influence--Nier: Automata--to add new outfits and collectibles themed after the acclaimed game, and recently, it added new content inspired by Shift other game, Goddess of Victory: Nikke. This also included more unlockable outfits, new quests, and a brutal boss fight against Scarlet from the mobile game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-sequel-seemingly-confirmed-by-developer-shift-up/1100-6531674/">A Stellar Blade sequel is already in development</a>, and Shift Up is aiming to have it out by 2027.</p>

                <p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> tech demo earlier this month, CD Projekt Red has shared why it has decided to focus on developing the game for consoles first, rather than for PC.</p><p>In case you missed it, the State of Unreal showcase offered us the first in-engine look at The Witcher 4 by highlighting the new, explorable region of Kovir, a brand-new look at the game's protagonist, Ciri, while also showing off the many features of Unreal Engine 5, which the game will utilize rather than the studio's proprietary engine.</p><p>It looked beautiful, but what's more impressive is the fact that the tech demo was captured entirely on the base PlayStation 5 at 60fps, with ray tracing.</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-is-taking-a-console-first-development-approach-but-with-good-reason" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), CDPR’s VP of technology, Charles Tremblay, has explained that the studio is aiming for a "console-first" development with The Witcher 4 after learning from its mistakes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OplYN2MMI4Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Tremblay said. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to say, 'This time around we really want to be more console-first development.'"</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's launch in 2020 was a disaster, particularly for PlayStation and Xbox. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions did have their issues, it was the PS4 and Xbox One versions that suffered most. Performance was so bad on the last-gen consoles that, at one point, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-been-removed-from-playstation-store-refunds-will-be-issued/1100-6485659/" data-ref-id="1100-6485659">the game was taken down from the PS Store</a> altogether, and refunds were issued.</p><p>Almost five years and a bunch of updates later, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">best RPGs</a> you can play right now, but CDPR has said it doesn't want to make the same mistakes again with The Witcher 4.</p><p>Jakub Knapik, VP and Global Art Director at CDPR, explained that by focusing on the game's development with consoles, it will make "scaling up" to PC easier, as opposed to scaling down for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>"We wanted to solve certain foundations," Knapik said. "It’s pretty logical when you think about it, because it’s easier to scale up than down. We knew that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there’s room to scale up. Now, what that means is another question. We’re CDPR: We always like to push PCs to the limit. It’s just a creative process how to really use it."</p><p>However, Tremblay later admitted that releasing The Witcher 4 on Xbox Series S at 60fps "will definitely be extremely challenging" and that the studio is now actively trying to figure it out.</p><p>Despite the "console-first" approach, the VP of technology confirmed that PC players who invest in their hardware won't miss out.</p><p>"In the past, something that’s super important for the group is that if people pay good money for their hardware, then we want them to have what the game can provide for that, not like a simplified experience," he said.</p><p>"So this is something we will definitely explore. The company started as a PC company, and we’ll definitely want to have the best experience for the PC gamer for sure. But it’s too early to say what this will mean for The Witcher 4."</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date just yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027</a> at the earliest. The studio is also actively working on multiple other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake</a>.</p>
