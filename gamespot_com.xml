                <p>Have you ever noticed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> takes up a lot more room on PC than it does on either Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5? At 150GB, the game is roughly three times bigger on PC than on consoles. According to Arrowhead game studio deputy technical director Brendan Armstrong, the reason why is that Helldivers 2 is still catering to a small segment of PC users.</p><p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Armstrong wrote that Helldivers 2's install footprint is so large because most of it is duplicated for the benefit of players who still use mechanical hard disk drives. It's an antiquated process that features duplicate data grouped close together in order to reduce loading times. Armstrong notes that the duplication is not necessary for players who have long since upgraded to solid state drives, but Arrowhead has had difficulty determining how many players remain on mechanical HDDs.</p><p>"How many Helldivers 2 players are still using mechanical HDD? The truth is that we don't currently know," Armstrong wrote. "Even the Steam user surveys are unable to give us data on mechanical HDD use in the overall gamer population. Our best estimates put it at around 12% of all PC gamers, but the data is very unreliable and relies on a lot of extrapolations. Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that Helldivers 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication. Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad."</p><p>Armstrong laid out some potential solutions and noted that the next update will make some progress towards shrinking the file size. However, he warns that players may not notice the difference "because the new stuff we've added will eat those gains." For a medium-term solution, Arrowhead plans to bundle common assets together rather than featuring so many duplicate files. The downside is that it will make the game slightly slower for mechanical HDD users, but he hopes to keep the load times to "less than 30 seconds."</p><p>Going forward, Arrowhead will also work to improve its engine and improve compression techniques that reduce the need for duplication. However, Armstrong added that the studio doesn't know yet if the impact on load times will make this an infeasible solution.</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studio CEO Shams Jorjani recently stated that the team's goal for Helldivers 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-arent-making-sequel-plans/1100-6535043/" data-ref-id="1100-6535043">to keep it going forever</a>, rather than moving on to Helldivers 3. The studio also released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-tackles-cave-crashes-and-audio-bugs/1100-6534782/">a patch that tackled cave crashes and audio bugs</a>. More recently, Arrowhead acknowledged a long <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-planned-for-october-with-bigger-performance-pieces-needing-more-time/1100-6534979/" data-ref-id="1100-6534979">list of problems to address</a>, including "issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs." An update is planned for later this month, but many of those issues may take more time to fix.</p>

                <p>While Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days officially begin on October 7, several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">products are already seeing discounts ahead of the event</a>. This includes steep price cuts for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQ9K7S1Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crucial P310 1TB</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQBQZ9LX?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB M.2 SSDs</a>, which are down to their <strong>lowest prices ever</strong>. The 1TB model is $75 (was $96) while the 2TB version is $112 (normally $145). These internal SSDs come with a built-in heatsink, meaning they work out of the box with all PS5 models, as well as PCs that support the NVMe M.2 format. These are great deals if you're looking to add a bit of extra space to your computer or console during the busy fall release season. However, we don't know how long these deals will be available--in fact, we've already seen similar early Prime Big Deal Days discounts on other SSD models sell out--so it's worth grabbing one of these internal drives while you can</p><p>Note that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3WKYQPS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4TB version</a> of the Crucial P310 NVMe M.2 SSD is also available; however, it is not currently on sale and can only be purchased from third-party sellers. However, we have a few alternative options if you're shopping around, including Samsung's popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Workstations-Compatible-Playstation-MZ-V9P4T0CW/dp/B0BHJGV9WR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro</a>. It's available in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities, and all of them are also on sale (though they're noticeably more expensive than the Crucial lineup). These support speeds up to 7,450MB/s, and while that speed difference is negligible on PS5, it could be useful if you're installing the drive on a PC.</p><p>If you're looking for something more affordable, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-LNM790X001T-RN9NU/dp/B0CGKPPZY9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar's NM790 SSD Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSDs</a> are also on sale. The 1TB model is down to just $70 (was $95), while the 2TB version is $130 (was $165), and the 4TB model is $240 (normally $305).</p><p>For those who need more than 4TB of space, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQP4F3Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WD_Black 8TB SN850P</a> with a heatsink is seeing a slight discount to $615 (was $650). That's a hefty price to be sure, but you can get quite a bit of use out of an 8TB drive like that. Check out the list below for all of the early Prime Big Deal Days discounts on internal SSDs with heatsinks below, and then head over to our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deals Day hub</a> to see even more early discounts from Amazon's sale--and check back when the full sale is live October 7 and 8 to see the best price cuts on games, Blu-rays, hardware, and more.</p><h2>More Deals on Internal NVMe M.2 SSDs with Heatsinks</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQ9K7S1Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crucial P310 NVMe M.2 SSD with heatsink</a> - 1TB</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQBQZ9LX?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crucial P310 NVMe M.2 SSD with heatsink</a> - 2TB</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-LNM790X001T-RN9NU/dp/B0CGKPPZY9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar NM790 SSD Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD with heatsink</a> - 1TB</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-LNM790X001T-RN9NU/dp/B0CGKHGMW5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar NM790 SSD Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD with heatsink</a> - 2TB</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-LNM790X001T-RN9NU/dp/B0CGKY9K2Y?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar NM790 SSD Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD with heatsink</a> - 4TB</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Workstations-Compatible-Playstation-MZ-V9P4T0CW/dp/B0BHJGV9WR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro with heatsink - 1TB</a> -- $110 (<del>$140</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Workstations-Compatible-Playstation-MZ-V9P4T0CW/dp/B0BHJDY57J?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro with heatsink - 2TB</a> -- $163 (<del>$210</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Workstations-Compatible-Playstation-MZ-V9P4T0CW/dp/B0CHHFR1LG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro with heatsink - 4TB</a> -- $310.59 (<del>$385</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQP4F3Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WD_Black SN850P with heatsink - 8TB</a> - $615 (<del>$650</del>)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/">Get Popular Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For $15 Or Less At Amazon This Week</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Drops To All-Time Best Price For Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shinings-new-4k-steelbook-edition-is-back-in-stock-at-walmart-releases-next-week/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New 4K Steelbook Edition Is Back In Stock At Walmart, Releases Next Week</a></li>   </ul> </div>

There are plenty of powerful guns and equipment to try, as we went over in our best BO7 loadouts guide but you'll also want to make sure you have the best perks to suit your playstyle. In this guide, we'll discuss the recommended perks and Wildcards, and we'll also break down how the new Combat Specialties work this year.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</a><ul><li><a href="#Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</a><ul><li><a href="#Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</a></li><li><a href="#Core_Specialties">Core Specialties</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV when moving, planting, defusing, or controlling Scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. This can also be a smart pick if you're planning on making a class to lay low with a sniper rifle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja: </strong>Move more quietly. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost and Ninja are both in the same perk slot this year, so you <strong>can't equip them both</strong> for a stealth loadout unless you choose the Perk Greed Wildcard, as mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded: </strong>Undetectable by AI targeting and thermal optics. Player-controlled scorestreaks don't highlight you. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as a Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch in a pinch, as Black Ops 7 features plenty of lethal scorestreaks that can target you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Flak Jacket:</strong> Reduces incoming explosive and fire damage. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Flak Jacket is a solid pick if you're an objective player looking to jump on a Hardpoint or Domination flag. It will help protect you from the grenades lobbed your way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846"></a><figcaption>The D.A.W.G. scorestreak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Looper:</strong> Gain the ability to re-earn Scorestreaks in the same life. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, you can't keep earning your streaks in the same life, and you need to die to reset them. Looper allows you to keep earning your streaks over and over. This is a good perk if you're someone who can rack up plenty of points and want to keep earning streaks.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed remain so important in Black Ops 7's fast-paced multiplayer. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Reduced weapon motion and full ADS on slides, dives, and wall jumps. Take less fall damage. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the most popular pick for the third perk slot. Dexterity is what you'll want to equip to make the most of Black Ops 7's omnimovement while engaging in gunfights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker:</strong> See rough locations of nearby enemies on your minimap and see their footsteps in the world. Aiming down sights auto-pings enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't care as much about the movement aspects, Tracker is a great perk for getting more intel. This perk lets you follow highlighted footsteps and hunt your enemy on the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Bankroll is great if you normally struggle to earn streaks or just want to give yourself a boost to earn them faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Wildcard system returns in Black Ops 7. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize and make your loadout feel even more powerful. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill: </strong>Equip any non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill lets you run an additional primary weapon. This is great for pairing something slow, like a sniper rifle or marksman rifle, with something faster, like a submachine gun. This lets you be prepared for more situations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter: </strong>Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Gunfighter lets you add three more attachments to create a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 includes a Specialty Bonus system similar to Black Ops 6. The three perks you select for your loadout will determine your Combat Specialty. Equip three perks of the same category to activate the Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), or Strategist (green) Combat Specialty bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can now activate Hybrid Combat Specialties when pairing perks of different categories. As long as your loadout includes at least two perks of the same color, you're guaranteed to unlock a Hybrid Combat Specialty.</p><p dir="ltr">Any of these specialties can be a nice addition, but see what bonus might fit your playstyle. It may or may not be worth it to tailor your perks toward the specific bonus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579848" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579848"></a><figcaption>Tactician Hybrid Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hybrid Specialty: Scout (Red and blue perks)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Scout is an offense and stealth hybrid.

                <p>Just because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days</a> sale doesn't officially start until October 7, it doesn't mean you can't start saving early. As with any flagship sale at Amazon, great deals start going live days ahead of the actual event, and we're already finding a few worthwhile offers popping up at the online retailer. That includes over $100 off the Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle, which not only comes with a no-ads version of the tablet itself, but also a keyboard case and a stylus (which you probably would've ended up buying separately, anyway). The <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">64GB No Ads bundle</a> normally starts at $370, but with Amazon's early Prime Big Deal Days discount, you can pick it up for just $236.49. Alternate configurations of the bundle are also discounted ahead of Prime Big Deal Days, as well as a few other Amazon Fire Tablet models, which we've rounded up below.</p><div title="6535126 - Fire Max 11 Prime Big Deal Days" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4527" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535126 - Fire Max 11 Prime Big Deal Days" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amazon.com\/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen\/dp\/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Amazon Fire Max 11 Tablet Productivity Bundle (64GB - No Ads)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amazon.com\/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen\/dp\/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$236.49 (was $370)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This Amazon Fire Max 11 bundle comes with the 64GB, ad-free version of the tablet, as well as a keyboard case and stylus, which is essentially everything you need. The Fire Max 11 is Amazon's latest addition to the Fire Tablet lineup, featuring an updated 11-inch display and significantly enhanced processing power. In the days leading up to Amazon's sale, you can get this whole package for just $236.49, saving you $133 compared to its regular $370 price.</p>                      </div><p>These aren't the only Fire tablet devices getting early Prime Big Deal Days discounts. If you don't need the accessories from the above bundles, the Fire Max 11 64GB is available on its own for just $155 (was $245), while the 128GB variant is $190 (normally $280). You can also save on older models like the Fire HD 10 32GB, which is half off at $70 (normally $140), or pick up the Fire HD 8 Plus 32GB for just $75, saving you nearly $100 compared to its standard $170 price.
