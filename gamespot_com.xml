                <p>The latest teaser for Call of Duty's upcoming weed-themed makeover of Nuketown ended with a reference to a well-known stoner celebrity, Seth Rogen, prompting some to believe he's coming to the game as a playable character.</p><p>In the video below, we see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/" data-ref-id="1100-6530786">Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as their Jay and Silent Bob characters</a> enjoying a COD match when a player named "CanadianSmokeMonster" joins their party. You can then hear Rogen's unmistakable laugh, suggesting Rogen is indeed this player. Both Mewes and Smith exchange shocked looks, playing up the possibility that Rogen is somehow involved with the upcoming update.</p><p>Rogen is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/conan-obrien-plays-mario-kart-8-with-seth-rogen-an/1100-6439329/" data-ref-id="1100-6439329">known gamer</a> and is renowned for his pot-smoking habits, so he'd be a natural fit for some kind of Call of Duty crossover. However, nothing is confirmed at the moment. Jay and Silent Bob came to Call of Duty earlier this month as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/" data-ref-id="1100-6531027">The Blaze of Glory event</a>, including the 4/20 version of Nuketown called Blaze Town, is arriving late, which is likely due to Season 3's initial delay shifting the original start time for the Reloaded update. Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">major announcements for Season 3 Reloaded</a>, including a new weapon, Ranked Play for Warzone, and more multiplayer maps. Activision hasn't announced a start date for the midseason, but based on the battle pass timer, it should begin around May 1.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, PS5 users now have a new setting to allow them to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-hear-footsteps-better-in-call-of-duty-with-ps5s-audio-focus-settings/1100-6531146/" data-ref-id="1100-6531146">hear footsteps better in Call of Duty</a> and other games.</p>
