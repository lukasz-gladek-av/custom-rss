It protects your desk from scratches, smudges, and spills while offering a smooth surface for your mouse to glide across. It has plenty of space for your keyboard and other items in your workspace.</p><p>Beyond its utility, a desk mat of this size is a good way to pull together a desktop--instead of all your accessories floating around haphazardly, it helps give some shape to an otherwise amorphous space.</p><p>If you want even more space, a few other dimensions are on sale, including 36- and 48-inch models. The 36 x 17-inch model only costs an extra $1.60. The cost spikes to $19.89 for the 48-inch version, but this one is large enough to cover the entire surface on many desks.

                <p dir="ltr">It might be called Grounded 2, but the new game is flying high so far on launch day. That's because the sequel has already topped the all-time peak of Steam concurrent players for the original. In fact, it didn't even take a full hour to break the record.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1950267658240401667" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Xbox commentator Klobrille pointed out Grounded 2's strong start on Steam. The open-world survival game has over 49,500 concurrent players on Valve's platform at the time of publication, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. That easily clears the all-time peak of 32,012 concurrent players in 2021 for Grounded, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/962130/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. Keep in mind that Grounded 2 is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-8-more-games-soon-including-multiple-day-one-new-releases/2900-6766/#9">available on Game Pass Ultimate for Xbox Series X|S and PC Game Pass</a>--as well as available to buy for $30.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-announced-launching-very-soon/1100-6532251/">Grounded 2 was announced</a> not even two months ago during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. The survival game basically mixes the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie with the Rust video game. Developer Obsidian is once again behind the sequel, though this time Eidos-Montreal is assisting with the title.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest new features with Grounded 2 is buggies--basically vehicles to utilize. While buggies were considered for the original game, starting fresh with a sequel was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-grounded-2-was-the-only-way-obsidian-could-introduce-this-key-feature/1100-6532318/">the only way to actually introduce them</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-guides-hub/1100-6533467/">Grounded 2 guides hub</a>.</p>

Activision has announced that the stadium is opening up to become a new playable space.</p><p>Activision is also debuting a new mode, Stadium Resurgence. A 36-player mode, Stadium Resurgence is described as a "rapid action mode" where the skirmishes come fast on a smaller section of the overall map focused on the stadium itself. The mode debuts during the second full week of Season 5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540438" data-ratio="0.56381486676017" data-width="713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540438"></a><figcaption>The stadium is opening.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png"></figure><p>The publisher also teased something bigger for the stadium, saying a "massive disruption across Verdansk is imminent," along with an image of a red beam shooting down from the sky.</p><p>"Recon teams have confirmed the existence of a clandestine military base hidden within the sealed walls of the National Acropolis Arena. The extent of the threat remains unclear, though a weapon capable of large-scale destruction is expected to be unearthed within the vicinity," Activision said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540439" data-ratio="0.55894590846047" data-width="721" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540439"></a><figcaption>Something is going down in Warzone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png"></figure><p>Additionally, Warzone is getting a new contract called Satellite Hijack. For this contract, players must breach the stadium in the "most impressively explosive way possible." Activision's blog post about this contract contains redacted sections that suggests the contract has some narrative ramifications that Activision does not want people to know about ahead of time. One of the redacted sections pertains to an award that players and their squadmates will receive for completing the contract.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540437" data-ratio="0.50611246943765" data-width="1636" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540437"></a><figcaption>Something mysterious is in store.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond the changes to Warzone, the Season 5 update adds new maps, modes, guns, operators, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-blackcell-bundle-revealed-with-a-surprising-operator/1100-6533530/" data-ref-id="1100-6533530">BlackCell bundle</a>, and more.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the next entry in the Call of Duty series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a> and it's coming later this year.
