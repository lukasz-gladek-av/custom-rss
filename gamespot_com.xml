                <p dir="ltr">Today during the Day Of The Devs Summer Game Fest Showcase, South African developer Nyamakop, in partnership with Mooncat Games, revealed Relooted, a heist game where a group of thieves try to return priceless artifacts to the cultures that revere them.</p><p dir="ltr">Each mission in Relooted plays out in three phases: First, players will scope out the museum and locate the target artifact. Next, they'll enter the building and create their getaway path as quietly as possible, avoiding guards and other obstacles along the way. Finally, it's time to grab the artifact and escape using the path created in phase two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507609" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507609"></a><figcaption>Relooted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In an interesting twist, the artifacts players will be targeting in Relooted are not fictional ones made up for the game. Instead, they are real-world artifacts that are currently sitting in Western museums, and each in-game artifact comes with a brief biography of its origin, the culture in which it originated, and why that artifact is so revered by that culture.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, one of the artifacts shown in the Day Of The Devs segment is the Ngadji Drum, a drum of the Pokomo people discovered in Africa in the 1870s. The drum was stolen by British colonists in the early 1900s and sent to a museum--114 years later, the brother of the Pokomo king became the first person to see the drum since its theft, when he was brought to the museum and allowed to view it in storage.</p><p dir="ltr">The Day Of The Devs presentation has featured world premieres and updates for multiple upcoming indie games, including Big Walk from Untitled Goose Game developer House House and mixtape from The Artful Escape dev Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur. It also announced Snap And Grab, an '80s-themed heist game from No Goblin and Annapurna Interactive, as well as a new look at Possessors from Heart Machine and Devolver Digital.</p><p dir="ltr">Relooted is scheduled to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. No release window was announced during the Day Of The Devs livestream.</p>

                <p>Coffee Stain, the publisher behind Goat Simulator, Valheim, and Satisfactory, has announced a new roguelike called Into the Unwell. In development at Swedish studio She Was Such A Good Horse, the game is designed to look like an early 20th-century cartoon.</p><p>Built around cooperative hack-and-slash mechanics, Into the Unwell focuses on chaotic gameplay and over-the-top enemies and environments. Its most striking feature is its art style, which specifically pulls on "rubber hose" animation associated with cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, and early Looney Tunes. Its aesthetic also seems evocative of the imagery of animated films like Alice in Wonderland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tBGtZXwM8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2tBGtZXwM8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>While similar in inspiration to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cuphead/" data-ref-id="5000-285254">Cuphead</a><span>, Into the Unwell is distinct in that it features 3D combat and platforming. The announcement trailer shows off some of the environmental challenges and boss fights that players can expect from the game, which seem from this short glimpse that they might be quite punishing.</span></p><p>According to a press release, the gameplay will also embrace the weird and psychedelic vibes of the aesthetics. Coffee Stain writes, "Players will find themselves in a cartoonish fever dream where they'll encounter eccentric anthropomorphic enemies, and attempt boss fights as bizarre as they are belligerent."</p><p>Into the Unwell is built to be played solo or with up to four players in co-op, and it is launching in Steam Early Access in the near future. It is the debut game from studio She Was Such A Good Horse, which is composed of a handful of veteran developers from across the games industry. No details have been shared about whether it is coming to other platforms beyond PC.</p>

                <p>Yakuza developer RGG Studio's Project Century has two new trailers and a new name, both revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>. Now dubbed Stranger Than Heaven, the game takes place in Japan during the early 20th century. In the trailer, we get some looks at the scenery and nightlife of the time period, along with some glimpses of hard-hitting, bloody action gameplay.</p><p>The story trailer showcases our main character in a smoky nightclub watching a performance before going outside for a panoramic view of Japan, showing how modernization and increased international influence have transformed the country. While the previous trailer for Stranger than Heaven showed the time setting as 1915--the Taisho Era--this trailer indicates the action is taking place in 1943, which would be in the midst of World War II. This could be a sign that the game will take place over a lengthy period of time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHUs5_vSYHY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dHUs5_vSYHY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also see our character, Daito, taking on some foes, including a choice of whether or not to show a character mercy--potentially indicating a choice/morality system. At the end, Daito converses with a clearly Western character--who even drops a 1940s slur asking about Daito's ethnic origins--only for Daito to reveal that he has blue eyes, something associated with Western heritage.</p><p>No platforms or a release date were mentioned, but we assume that Stranger than Heaven will be targeting current-gen consoles and PC.</p>

                <p>The Wu-Tang Clan has long since been a multimedia group, putting their name behind comic books, a TV show, video games, and more. Now they're headed back to the world of gaming again with Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a co-op brawler that has you rescuing the Clan from the Deceiver. Check out the latest trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826WlpkBZOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This 3D brawler has three core pillars according to developer Brass Lion: Rebuild Shaolin, Battle with the Wu, and Protect Ya Neck. Ghostface Killah asks you to rescue his Wu brothers so that you can battle alongside them and use their legendary skills to restore Shaolin, the home of Wu-Tang. As you progress, you'll collect jewels to customize your fighting style and from the description of the game, it sounds like you'll see your work reflected in the community of Shaolin.</p><p>The game sports an "afro-surrealist meets anime-inspired" art design and increasingly difficult battles against fantastical enemies through the "Chambers" of the world. The game sports a soundtrack that includes classic Wu-Tang tracks and new material overseen by producer Just Blaze. You can play with up to two friends for three-player co-op gaming.</p><p>No release date is available so far, but the game is set to come to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store when it does release.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">New development team Cubit Studios revealed the first trailer for its debut game during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, a sci-fi action game called Infinitesimals.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Obsidian's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded/">Grounded</a>, Infinitesimals follows a group of tiny people struggling to survive in a world that's much bigger than them, where even commonplace things like mushrooms pose a steep obstacle. Unlike Grounded, there's a lot more than just big bugs to deal with in Infinitesimals' world. The group of explorers you play as encounters an alien civilization with advanced robotics, and they don't all seem pleased to meet you.</p><p dir="ltr">"Play as the leader of an elite alien squadron stranded on a mysterious planet after a catastrophic crash," the game's official description reads. "Barely the size of an insect, you must navigate an enormous world filled with towering terrain, local wildlife, and deadly machines. As you search for the missing members of your team and uncover the fate of the vanished colony you were meant to join, you’ll face the relentless threat of the Hunter Gatherers, the mechanical sentinels that dominate the landscape."</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games will publish Infinitesimals, and it's set for a 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
