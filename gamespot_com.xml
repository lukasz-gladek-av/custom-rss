                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Festival of the Lost 2024 is right around the corner. Arriving a bit later than usual, Halloween's celebration across the solar system promises some interesting surprises, from new masks to a slight rework of the event compared to previous years. If you're wondering what the armor ornaments look like, developer Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shared details</a> about them, too.</p><p>Here's everything you can expect from Festival of the Lost 2024 in Destiny 2, including start times, masks, and the available rewards. We can't guarantee you'll be safe from jumpscares, though.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</a></li><li><a href="#Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</a></li><li><a href="#What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</h2><p>Festival of the Lost 2024 is kicking off after the weekly Destiny 2 reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on October 29. The event comes to an end with the weekly reset on November 12.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894"></a><figcaption>Don't miss Destiny's annual Halloween party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg"></figure><p>It's a bit later compared to last year's edition, which started on October 17, but the scary vibes are the same.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</h2><p>Eva Levante will return to Festival of the Lost. As in previous years, you'll stumble upon her in the Tower. After a quick introductory quest and some candy delivery, you'll be all set to start earning rewards and wearing some cool masks.</p><h2 id="Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</h2><p>If you were used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-farm-spectral-pages-quickly-during-festival-of-the-lost/1100-6518479/" data-ref-id="1100-6518479">farming Spectral Pages</a>, well, that's in the past. Bungie has announced that players no longer need to collect the item to complete chapters of the Book of the Forgotten. You only need Manifested Pages.</p><p>Alongside chests in Haunted Sectors, Manifested Pages will drop from "many different sources while you're wearing a mask," said Bungie. We'll have to wait until the event kicks off to confirm what the developer is referring to, although it's safe to assume it might be related to other activities aside from Haunted Sectors, which will come in handy.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</h2><p>It seems the celebrations around the release of Destiny 2 The Final Shape are still ongoing, as this year's Festival of the Lost is debuting seven new masks. Bungie also mentioned that masks found from Haunted Sectors will roll with higher stats, while the ones from Expert Haunted Sectors will have both high stats and "spikey rolls" with them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893"></a><figcaption>Festival of the Lost 2024 masks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg"></figure><p>Below is the list of masks in Festival of the Lost 2024 (official names TBC):</p><ul><li>Cayde-6 Mask</li><li>Witness Mask</li><li>Tower Staff</li><li>Kadi 55-30 Mask</li><li>Thrall Mask</li><li>Runner Mask</li><li>Nezarec Mask</li><li>Ghost Mask</li></ul><h2 id="What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</h2><p>Alongside the removal of Spectral Pages, there are a few tweaks and additions worth considering before diving into Festival of the Lost 2024.</p><p>Like in previous years, in order to earn Eerie Engrams, Haunted Sectors are your best bet. Keep in mind that you'll be able to grab more Eerie Engrams in Expert Haunted Sectors, as they know have a chance to drop an additional engram.</p><p>In the weapons department, you can expect a familiar lineup of Festival of the Lost guns, only with updated perk pools. Bungie doesn't want to share too many details, except for a few perk combinations as a tease:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechabre (Aggressive Arc Sniper Rifle):</strong> Lone Wolf in column 3, Closing Time in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Green (Rapid-Fire Solar Pulse)</strong>: Loose Change in column 3, Incandescent in column 4, Search Party, Field Tested as origin traits.</li><li><strong>Braytech Werewolf (Precision Kinetic Auto Rifle)</strong>: Rewind Rounds in column 3, Onslaught in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Acosmic (Rapid-Fire Void Grenade Launcher)</strong>: Withering Gaze in column 3, Bait and Switch in column 4, and Search Party, Nadie as the origin traits.</li></ul><p>Also, you're now able to buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva, basically avoiding the need to complete the Dual Destiny quest in Destiny 2. For this, you'll need to own The Final Shape expansion, but know that you won't be able to attune the class items you buy from Eva. Unless you complete Dual Destiny, you'll only get random rolls. But hey, luck might be on your side.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</h2><p>Your candy-gathering efforts won't be for naught, as there'll be quite a few rewards to earn during Destiny 2's Halloween event.</p><p>Below are all of the Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards:</p><ul><li>Wizard Armor Ornaments for a scary vibe.</li><li>The return of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack shader</a>.</li><li>Arcane Embrace as a new weapon: The shotgun has Arc element and a Heavy Burst subtype, so it fires a hard-hitting, two-round burst while slightly reducing flinching from incoming fire while aiming. As teased by Bungie, a potential combo for the weapon is Fourth Times the Charm in column 3, Precision Instrument in column 4, and Search Party in origin trait.</li><li>Lost Memento is also returning as a reward, and you'll be able to hold up to three at a time. You can earn it from completing the Twilight Triumph or as a random drop from focusing any items.</li><li>You can also earn the new Spectral Carapace emblem for completing the Twilight Triumph.</li></ul><p>Have fun in this year's Festival of the Lost!</p>

This is the lowest price ever for the PlayStation 5 physical edition.

However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review</a>, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake "stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the first of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes to receive a physical release for PS5, but soon it will have company.
