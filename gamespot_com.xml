                <p>Unlike some of the other characters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, Adam Warlock doesn't have a wide variety of looks to choose from. But starting later this week, players will get a chance to pick up a free Adam Warlock costume as part of Marvel Rivals' latest Twitch drop.</p><p>Starting on March 13 at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET, fans who watch some of their favorite Marvel Rivals-affiliated players on Twitch can earn up to three rewards. Watching for 30 minutes will give them an Adam Warlock Will of Galacta spray, while staying for one hour will unlock an Adam Warlock Will of Galacta nameplate. But to get the costume, players will have to watch for four hours.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457849" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457849"></a><figcaption>Adam Warlock's Will of Galacta costume.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4457849-marvelrivalsadamwarlockthewillofgalacta.jpg"></figure><p>Magneto and Hela have previously received Will of Galactca costumes that incorporate elements of her look into theirs. It seems likely that Warlock won't be the last one, especially since Hela and Magneto's costumes were also released as Twitch drops. Judging from the pic above, purple may turn out to be a good look for Warlock. But players will only be able to get him in that outfit through April 3 at 7pm PM PT / 10 PM ET.</p><p>NetEase has released a new Marvel Rivals patch that introduced a new LTM called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-patch-notes-introduce-clone-rumble-ltm-new-event-and-tons-of-bug-fixes/1100-6529942/" data-ref-id="1100-6529942">Clone Rumble</a>, which lets players pick the same characters for often-chaotic results. Fans also spotted the way that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dracula-still-owes-moon-knight-money-as-marvel-rivals-calls-back-to-a-classic-meme/1100-6529732/" data-ref-id="1100-6529732">Marvel Rivals incorporated a Moon Knight and Dracula meme</a> into the current season.</p><p>A recent report suggested that NetEase considered replacing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">Marvel's characters or canceling the game outright</a> to avoid paying Disney for the rights to use them in the game. But given the game's meteoric popularity, keeping the Marvel heroes intact appears to have been the right call.</p>

                <p>It's a tradition for MLB The Show to add baseball legends to the game, and this year's title is no exception. Sony and San Diego Studio have unveiled some of the biggest names heading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-limited-edition-is-up-for-preorder-includes-topps-baseball-card/1100-6529227/" data-ref-id="1100-6529227">MLB The Show 25</a>, including one of the greatest hitters of all time, Ted Williams.</p><p>Williams has appeared in previous installments of MLB The Show, but this marks his return after many years away. Williams will be joined by over 200 legends, including returning players Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige, Ken Griffey Jr., and Derek Jeter. Some of the new additions include Roger Clemens and Manny Ramirez, as well as Negro Leagues legends Wilber “Bullet Joe” Rogan and James “Cool Papa” Bell. The trailer below briefly shows some of these stars in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGo1-jn6VUY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGo1-jn6VUY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, some of the other legends featured include Jose Bautista, Jason Kipnis, Lance Berkman, Bobby Abreu, Gil Hodges, Jason Varitek, Darren O’Day, Don Baylor, Bobby Grich, Jim Kaat, Ted Simmons, Preston Wilson, Reggie Sanders, and Hank Greenberg.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 will also continue its look at the past with The Negro Leagues - Season 3, which revisits an era when Black players weren't allowed to take part in Major League Baseball. Some truly great players emerged from that period, and the season mode will incorporate Negro Leagues legends through gameplay, historic footage, and "informative storytelling" from Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick. All of the Negro Leagues players from the first two seasons will be available at launch.</p><p>Unfortunately for PS4 and Xbox One players, MLB The Show 25 will be skipping those platforms and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">it won't be on Game Pass this year</a>. However, it will be heading to Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on March 18. Players who purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition will get early access to the game on March 14.</p>
