                <p dir="ltr">Publisher Playsaurus has announced that Cookie Clicker will release on consoles May 22--exactly a week from today. One of the first major idle games, Cookie Clicker originally released on the web in 2013 before hitting Steam in 2021. The title, developed by DashNet, is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> (though of course at a later date).</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cookie-clicker-switch/">Nintendo's listing</a> for Cookie Clicker notes that the game will cost $5. This is in line with the Steam edition of the idle game. Playsaurus is promising more than 600 upgrades in Cookie Clicker, as well as the ability to "pet your dragon."

For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-havent-heard-of-bongo-cat-but-over-100000-people-are-playing-it-right-now/1100-6530839/">over 100,000 people were playing Bongo Cat</a> last month. The game sees a feline pawing a taskbar as a player clicks their mouse or types, and then you can earn hats for your digital kitty.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, last year saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-420000-people-were-clicking-a-banana-today/1100-6524275/">everyone clicking a Banana</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-massive-and-inexplicably-popular-banana-game-adds-new-skins/1100-6524446/">super popular game even got new skins</a> and saw almost 1 million concurrent players on Steam at one point, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 launches on June 5</a>, so it's not quite known whether Cookie Clicker will arrive on that date for the upcoming system or later on.</p>

                <p>After launching in South Korea, China, and Taiwan back in April 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x/" data-ref-id="5000-584986">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> finally has a worldwide release date. The Persona 5 spin-off hits PC and mobile devices on June 26, 2025, and brings with it even more of the series' stylish turn-based combat and an entirely new cast of Phantom Thieves.</p><p>Developed as a collaboration between Atlus' P-Studio and Chinese developer Black Wing Games, Persona 5: The Phantom X is a mobile-focused title that sends players back to the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a>, albeit as a new character and under slightly different circumstances. In it, players control Wonder, a second-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy whose worldview is shifted upon meeting a mysterious owl-like creature named Lufel. After some good old-fashioned exposition, the duo eventually set off on quest to recruit a new cast of Phantom Thieves, their ultimate goal being to restore the concept of desire back to humanity and put a stop to the mysterious force hellbent on taking it away.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5btk2fzbRjQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5btk2fzbRjQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What ensues is a continuously-expanding, live-service adventure filled with much of the same turn-based combat, social simulation, and time management elements found in mainline Persona titles. Players will get the chance to explore new dungeons and areas of Mementos, take on part-time jobs and join after-school clubs, strengthen their Personas, raise Wonder's social stats, and form relationships all while experiencing an original story. Players can also expect fan-favorite Persona characters--like Joker, Ann, Ryuji, and the rest of the original Phantom Thieves--to make appearances in the game via special contracts. Lastly, the Phantom X also introduces new elements to the series, including the PvE-focused Velvet Trials, mini-games, and the ability to create and join Guilds.</p><p>Since its release in select regions last year, the title has earned a lot of praise for its story and new cast of characters, with players stating that both are shockingly on par with those found in the Persona 5. This could certainly have something to do with Persona veterans--like series producer Kazuhisa Wada, composer Ryota Kozuka, and artist Shigenori Soejima--being involved in the game's development.</p><p>However, it's important to note that the upcoming title has gacha elements, similar to games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves. Though you don't <em>have </em>to spend money in order to play through The Phantom X, players are often encouraged to, which can definitely be a barrier when it comes to fully enjoying the game.</p><p>Persona 5: The Phantom X will launch on mobile and PC worldwide on June 26. For a closer look at the upcoming title, we've included screenshots and a few pieces of the game's key art below.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4494724,1300-4494725,1300-4494726,1300-4494727,1300-4494728,1300-4494729,1300-4494730,1300-4494731,1300-4494732,1300-4494733" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"></figure>
