                <p>The partnership between Xbox and IHOP kicked off in November with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">special-edition custom pancake Xbox</a> and a menu inspired by Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Now it's come to light that the partnership also includes the opportunity to get Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for "free" if you spend enough money at IHOP.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1866167680635691190" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, one of the perks of joining IHOP's loyalty program is the opportunity to earn PanCoins, which can be exchanged for a free copy of the game. It doesn't come cheap, though. Members earn one PanCoin for every $5 spent, and to unlock The Great Circle, you need 40 PanCoins ($200).</p><p>The Great Circle isn't the only game available, though, as 40 PanCoins also gets you a copy of Sea of Thieves, which is a completely different type of game. Meanwhile, 15 PanCoins gets you a one-month trial for Game Pass Ultimate. You can <a href="https://www.ihop.com/en/rewards/xbox-stack-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see all the available rewards on IHOP's website.</a></p><p>Of course, eating a lot of breakfast food is not the most direct or logical way to go about getting your hands on The Great Circle. After all, the game is included with Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) and PC Game Pass ($12/month), and is also available for direct purchase starting at $70 USD. As it happens, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-steeply-discounted-just-in-time-for-indiana-jones/1100-6526404/" data-ref-id="1100-6526404">Game Pass is steeply discounted right now</a>, just in time for the launch of The Great Circle.</p><p>The Great Circle is out now on Xbox and PC, and will come to PlayStation 5 in Spring 2025.

                <p>Surprise! CD Projekt Red still has more updates planned for Cyberpunk 2077, months after the Polish studio said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no longer had anyone working on the game</a>. The studio has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which will introduce "new features" to the role-playing game.</p><p>CD Projekt Red isn't ready to disclose what these features are but said it will host a video broadcast on December 10 where it will "dive deep" on what's coming to the game. The broadcast takes place at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET / 5 PM CET on December 10, and it will be streamed live on Twitch and YouTube.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 REDstreams alert 📢<br>Join us for a new episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REDstreams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#REDstreams</a>, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2!<br>See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel.… <a href="https://t.co/gxABDNpQN2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gxABDNpQN2</a></p>  — Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At the end of May 2024, CD Projekt Red confirmed that, for the first time in 10 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no one at the studio was working on Cyberpunk 2077.</a> Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion came out in September 2023, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-big-cyberpunk-2077-update-launches-december-5/1100-6519672/" data-ref-id="1100-6519672">final major update landing in December 2023. </a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 originally launched in December 2020.
