                <p>Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">handle 70% of its game QA and debugging</a>. The company went on to note that it wants to "establish a competitive advantage in game development." However, Michael Douse--the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian--has called out Square Enix and described its plan as "stupid."</p><p>"So QA are some of the most video games engaged people in any company," Douse wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986535697809854640" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>. "They are integral to your community teams. To publishing. They give you the real feedback. They know what is good and what is bad before the audience does, and they are the most resilient department."</p><p>"[The] idea that QA people can be replaced at a large scale is stupid because it supposes that the conversations with them can be replaced and they can't," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1986536143953781040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added Douse</a>. "They are a massively advantageous vibe check."</p><p>Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry. He cautions that losing QA workers risks missing out on future designers and other positions.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986537291645374734" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">QA is not an inherently entry-level job but I will also add that without gateways to the industry you won't find your lead designers. This is a stupid path. You want to be able to offer people beneficial positions that allow them to grow and help to grow you!</p>  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986537291645374734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a subsequent post, Douse noted that <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix aims to save $19.6 million</a> by outsourcing its QA to AI. He also questioned why executives weren't laid off if the company needs the savings so badly.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The desired annual savings of $19.6 million - while a substantial amount of money in real life terms - is not hugely substantial for a AAA company.

I'm pretty sure these games aren't failing because of QA, publishing, etc. <a href="https://t.co/MCJw16kBHz" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/MCJw16kBHz</a></p>  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Reports have emerged that Square Enix is already conducting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reportedly-conducting-mass-layoffs/1100-6536007/" data-ref-id="1100-6536007">a massive employee layoff</a>. Square Enix isn't the only video game company to embrace AI. Electronic Arts has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>."

Prominent game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> presents you with plenty of quests that require you to find materials or unique items, but only a few require you to use your materials to complete them. Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.</p><p><strong>You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.</p><p>When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.</p><h2>Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station</h2><p>The first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598921,1300-4598922" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.</p><h2>How to rewire the solar panel</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.</p><p>As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920"></a><figcaption>Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>If you need to tackle more quests, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is probably the last game you'd expect to need to go beehive hunting, but that's exactly what you'll need to do in the aptly-named Bees! quest--and shoutout to Embark Studios for the Arrested Development reference. This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.</p><p>You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.</p><p>When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.</p><h2>Where to find a beehive for the Bees! quest</h2><p>To collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932" data-ratio="0.56135770234987" data-width="1149" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932"></a><figcaption>Find the beehive here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933"></a><figcaption>Interact with the beehive to pick it up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg"></figure><p>With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a> for you.</p>

In the Espresso quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.</p><p>When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the espresso machine in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map.

                <p>Lance loves to send you out looking for stuff in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, and the A New Type of Plant quest is no different. In this outing, you'll be tasked with finding a possibly toxic plant growing in the Old Battleground area of the Dam Battlegrounds map, then bringing it back to Lance at Speranza. </p><p>You'll be required to extract from the map with the quest to finish A New Type of Plant, so it's a good idea to come equipped with a loadout that you feel comfortable with--especially one with a safe pocket. Equip a decent gun (it's best to prioritize one for human opponents in this case) and make sure you've stocked up on some ammo and healing items before you head in--just in case you need to fend off any attackers while trying to extract.</p><p>When you're ready to get raiding, here's how to complete A New Type of Plant.</p><h2>Where to find the Baron Husk</h2><p>The first objective you have in A New Type of Plant is to located the Baron Husk. This giant fallen ARC can be found in the Old Battleground section on the far western side of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This husk isn't particularly hard to spot, as it's a giant metal monstrosity that has clearly seen better days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864" data-ratio="0.56460044809559" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864"></a><figcaption>Old Battleground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>This area isn't known for being particularly heavy on foot traffic, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for other raiders. A simple "don't shoot!" might stand between you and grabbing your quest item, after all.</p><h2>Where to find the toxic plant</h2><p>The toxic plant has plenty of spawns around the Baron Husk area. It looks somewhat similar to the Great Mullein plant you've already had to gather for Lance's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-doctors-orders-quest-guide/1100-6536044/" data-ref-id="1100-6536044">Doctor's Orders quest</a>, except this one has orange blooms that are rather visually striking. If you're struggling to find the plants, check for directly next to the husk until you round one up. Make sure you loot it!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863"></a><figcaption>Make sure to add the plant to your inventory and take it back to Speranza.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you've picked up the toxic plant, you'll need to extract. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure you toss the quest item in there to keep it safe in case you run into trouble. Either way, head east to the Central Swamp Lift. This area is often crawling with ARC and frequently camped by other raiders, so don't be afraid to take things nice and slow--and keep your wits about you. You'll be back in Speranza in no time where you can turn in your quest to Lance.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Celeste's quest Digging Up Dirt is no different--though figuring out how to get to the dead drop she's asked you to retrieve can be a little tricky. In this guide, we'll fill you in on how to reach the dead drop inside the Santa Maria Houses so you can finish up the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><p>For this quest, you won't need to extract to receive credit. As such, you can always enter the map using a free loadout to reduce the pain of death should some ARC or other raider put a quick end to you. The last thing you'd want is to lose a bunch of your best gear because you were just trying to get a quest done, after all.</p><p>Here's where to find the dead drop for the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><h2>Where to find the dead drop for Digging Up Dirt</h2><p>The dead drop Celeste wants you to find is located at the Santa Maria Houses POI in the southern portion of Buried City. Luckily, it's a pretty safe area in most matches, so you aren't likely to get into too much trouble so long as you don't start any yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831" data-ratio="0.56564748201439" data-width="2224" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831"></a><figcaption>Santa Maria Houses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The dead drop is in the interior of the building here, but getting inside won't appear possible if you're trying to approach it from the ground floor. Instead, make your way to the roof and enter the open window up there. You'll drop into the attic where you can take a zipline down into the next level of the building.</p><p>Navigate the fairly linear building until you reach a large, open room filled with sand on the ground floor. Here, directly in the center of the room, will be the dead drop. Hop down and interact with it to complete the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833"></a><figcaption>Dead drop location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the quest for Celeste complete, you'll want to worry about extracting next. Both the Southern Station and Eastern Station are within reasonable proximity to you, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with and get the hell out of dodge before the timer runs down too much and spawns a boatload of ARC for you to fend off--or, you know, before another pesky raider comes along and causes any problems.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>
