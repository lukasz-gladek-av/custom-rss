It's equipped with a Mk. 2 Weapon Workshop, Personal Quarters, a safe for passive income, 10 storage slots for player vehicles, and a garage with a basement that provides access to the Los Santos' underground tunnels, allowing players who own the factory to travel to and from different areas with ease.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The FIB Files:</strong> The FIB Files include four new multi-stage missions for players to complete in return for rewards. Tasks include downing an IAA-protected aircraft, lifting military tech from Fort Zancudo, recovering a missing piece of art (without being seen), and accessing Maze Bank’s secret slush fund.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Dispatch Work: </strong>Agents of Sabotage introduces two new Dispatch Work missions, which see players lending a hand to Vincent Effenburger of the Los Santos Police Department.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Benefactor Terrorbyte Upgrades: </strong>The Terrorbyte's upgrades include a Collectible Scanner (for the collectible-hunter in all of us), a Master Control Terminal (to keep track of players' business stock, supplies, vehicle storage, and cargo), a Missile Lock-On Jammer (preventing enemies from locking on), and Silent Running mode (which hides the vehicle's radar blip).</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Wheels</strong>: Several new vehicles have been added to the game, including the Banshee GTS (which is free to claim for GTA+ Members through January 8), the Chavos V6, the Dinka Jester RR Widebody, and law enforcement versions of the Canis Terminus Patrol and Vapid Caracara Pursuit.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Heist Challenge rewards:</strong> Players who completed an eligible Heist Finale from November 7 - December 4 will earn the NOOSE Outfit. Meanwhile, the Police Predator boat is available to claim (via Warstock) by all players until December 15.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Quality-of-life improvements:</strong> Payouts for Drift and Drag Races have been improved, and will now automatically grant Body Armor when launching (and relaunching) missions. Additionally, players can now toggle through siren options when driving law-enforcement vehicles.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Rockstar, there's more new content heading to GTA Online in the near future. Upcoming features include holiday events, new Stunt Races celebrating the Lunar New Year, new Drift Races, the new El Strickler Military Rifle (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players only), and additional Transform Race tools for the Rockstar Creator.</p><p>GTA Online's free Agents of Sabotage expansion is available now on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.
