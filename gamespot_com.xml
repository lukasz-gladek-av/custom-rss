                <p>Over 140 ROMs from Sega's long defunct Sega Channel, including service-exclusive games that were thought lost to time and never-before-published prototypes, have now been recovered thanks to the latest efforts of the Video Game History Foundation.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWCUmTTVjMY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CWCUmTTVjMY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, until the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/segachannel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Game History Foundation</a> embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is 144 new ROMs that have been preserved, a new VGHF digital library collection that includes Shorrock's personal notes and presentations shedding light on the service (and an unannounced successor service called Express Games), and a documentary, Don't Just Watch TV: The Secrets of Sega Channel, which can be viewed on YouTube.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of its efforts, VGHF acquired a collection of ROMs that included some rare prototypes and games, including a never-before-seen Sega Genesis web browser and previously undumped game variants of Sega Channel-exclusive games, like Garfield: Caught in the Act - The Lost Levels and The Flintstones. According to VGHF, both games originated as abandoned projects that were then repurposed into exclusive Sega Channel content.</p><p dir="ltr">Also included in the files are previously unpreserved Sega Channel versions of games like Super Street Fighter II, which saw content removed in order to fit within Sega Channel's file-size limit. Other games on the service that were linear in nature were essentially split down the middle to fit within the file-size limit, with users needing a password to access the second half of the game. These split versions, as well as various "test drive" versions of games like Earthworm Jim and The Lost World: Jurassic Park that allowed Sega Channel players to play before their official release, have also been preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games," the VGHF states in its findings. "We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States."</p><p dir="ltr">The project to preserve Sega Channel is just one of VGHF's success stories this year, with the foundation previously announcing the launch of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-history-foundation-massive-digital-library-is-now-open-to-the-public/1100-6529151/" data-ref-id="1100-6529151">free-to-access digital resource library</a> for historians, researchers, and fans that includes more than 30,000 files from across 50 years of video game history. In August, the VGHF announced it had acquired the rights to publish a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vghf-adds-complete-digital-archive-of-classic-video-game-magazine/1100-6533722/" data-ref-id="1100-6533722">digital archive for the entirity of Computer Entertainer</a>, one of the first video game magazines.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">You would think stabbing a foe with a sword was enough. But a new update for Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you twist the weapon, elbow the enemy in the face, and then stab them again in the head. It's pretty gnarly, and it's part of title update 1.1.7, which is planned to start arriving December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/7xrzBsElcQq2dubHcOdGz3/ac-shadows-title-update-117-release-notes">the Ubisoft website</a>, the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they "bring more flair to your encounters." The official Assassin's Creed account <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNoK1tClsFg">on YouTube</a> shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNoK1tClsFg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wNoK1tClsFg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new update also brings quite a few improvements to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-and-really-soon/1100-6535663/">the recently released Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Ubisoft says that frame rate issues have been addressed, along with "various visual issues." However, this title update will come a day later, December 17, on Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/">Assassin's Creed Shadows won't get a second DLC expansion</a>.

In November, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exceeded-expectations-for-ubisoft-mirage-hits-10-million-players/1100-6536470/">Assassin's Creed franchise overall exceeded Ubisoft's expectations</a> for the company's last financial quarter.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Assassin's Creed Shadows could pave the way for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-assassins-creed-games-could-have-multiple-protagonists-says-ac-shadows-dev/1100-6536769/">more games in the franchise to feature multiple protagonists</a>. A decade ago, Assassin's Creed Syndicate debuted dual protagonists for the series with twins Jacob and Evie.
