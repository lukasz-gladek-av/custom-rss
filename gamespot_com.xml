                <p>Another new expansion for The Sims 4 has arrived, and Enchanted by Nature shakes up EA's long-running life sim in some big ways. That includes the introduction of a brand-new Fairy occult type, new methods for living off the land instead of in a house, and--most relevant to this article--an entirely new way for your Sims to get sick, called Ailments.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the standard illnesses in The Sims 4 don't pop up that often and are easily cured with generic medicine, Ailments are a whole new category of affliction that require specific cures--or help from a magical being with the ability to fix Ailments. Fortunately, Ailments are more annoying than dangerous--they really aren't severe enough to kill a Sim on their own--but their effects can be so disruptive that it's usually better to deal with them sooner than later.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</a><ul><li><a href="#What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</a></li><li><a href="#List_of_ailments">List of ailments</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514"></a><figcaption>A Sim with an Ailment is usually easy to spot, since some symptoms will be visible on their skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</h2><p dir="ltr">Ailments are contagious illnesses that can be caused by catching them from another Sim, being afflicted with one by a Fairy, or by being emotionally out of balance. The contagion factor is real, as hanging out in the same place as an infected Sim has a very good chance of giving your Sim an infection, too. And it's not just direct contact that'll get you--as with real illnesses, interacting with stuff that a sick person has touched can get your Sim sick too.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, being out of balance emotionally--this is indicated by the new balance meter in the Simology tab--makes it likely that your Sim will simply develop an Ailment without any extra help, but it also makes your Sim more vulnerable to catching something from another Sim. Likewise, being <em>in</em> balance fortifies your Sim against catching an Ailment naturally or from another Sim. Think of the emotional balance meter as a measure of your Sim's immune system.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</h3><p dir="ltr">There are several different ways that you can deal with your Sim's Ailment when they catch something. The first is to do nothing and let the Ailment run its course. While that may sound silly on its face, some of the ailments <em>do</em> have positive side effects--like Luck Magnet, which makes the infected Sim lucky by stealing luck from the other Sims around them. Gnome Lure, likewise, causes sentient garden gnomes to spawn like during Harvestfest. While I normally really don't like the gnomes, they've got a whole new use in the Enchanted by Nature expansion--Fairy Sims can enchant them with Fairy Dust to bring them to life.</p><p dir="ltr">So if you think the upside of the Ailment is worth the trouble, you can let it play itself out. Otherwise, there are four methods for ending an ailment immediately, all of which are relatively simple:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Use your phone to visit a naturopath, who will cure your Sim for 1,500 Simoleons</li><li dir="ltr">Ask any fairy to cure the Ailment--though fairies <em>cannot</em> cure <em>themselves</em> through magic.</li><li dir="ltr">"Manifest" a cure by visiting Moondrop Spring in the Everdew neighborhood of Innisgreen</li><li dir="ltr">Make your own cure at an apothecary table</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</h2><p dir="ltr">Crafting Ailment cures is a relatively easy process because they require only common ingredients that you can find without much difficulty, That's because Ailment cures are the first things your Sim learns to create when they learn the apothecary skill--the Ailment cures require level 1 or 2, so there's no grind involved. Which is a very good thing because even though Fairies can magically cure <em>other</em> Sims, they can't do that with Ailments that they themselves are afflicted with.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain the apothecary skill, a Sim just need to use any apothecary table to "Study Apothecary Cures," and then after a moment they'll be able to craft some Ailment cures--and since the rest only require skill level 2, it'll take just a few more moments of messing around with the apothecary table before your Sim can craft the rest of them.</p><p dir="ltr">And since these cures are low-level recipes, their ingredients are incredibly easy to find by casually foraging anywhere by clicking on any patch of grass in any Sims 4 world, or by purchasing the ingredients using the option on the apothecary table. None of the ingredients are expensive, so buying them shouldn't be a problem for folks who want to get right to it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="List_of_ailments">List of ailments</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Burning Passion:</strong> Makes the infected Sim very flirty, and also very likely to occasionally burn nearby objects</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Creation Impulse:</strong> Gives a Dazed moodlet, while also making the infected Sim better at crafting things.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Emotional Void:</strong> Dampens the infected Sim's emotions, and will also passively do the same to any nearby Sims.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gnome Lure:</strong> Makes gnomes spawn near the infected Sim</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greenie Meanie:</strong> Makes the infected Sim simultaneously very good at gardening and very cranky.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Luck Magnet:</strong> Makes the infected Sim lucky at the expense of those around them.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Simoleon Fever:</strong> Makes the infected Sim cough up money.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sonic Sinuses:</strong> Their sneezes are so powerful that they occasionally break things, but the Sim has improved handiness and can fix things easier.</li></ul>

This week, it kicked things off with an introduction to Vex, a new Siren who taps into her deadly abilities at a fairly stressful, and very unfortunate, time.</p><p dir="ltr">In a gameplay overview, we get a taste for how Vex will differ from other Sirens from the Borderlands games. Sirens are a special (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">very fun</a>) kind of being in the series that are able to tap into psychic abilities and are marked by glowing tattoos. Vex is much the same, but uses her newfound powers to provide her with a squad of minions.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Vex the Siren | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Vex stands apart from previous playable Sirens by focusing heavily on minions that she can summon, transforming her role into a kind of necromancer/pet class. One of her skill trees entirely focuses on a large alien cat familiar called Trouble, which Vex can summon and teleport around the battlefield. Many of the additional skills and modifiers on the tree augment Trouble's capabilities in battle, allowing them to soak up more damage, taunt enemies, or even explode.</p><p dir="ltr">As a Siren, Vex possesses many other abilities too, including one that allows her to send out a blast of phase energy, sprout some gnarly-looking wings, conjure a little orb/turret, and blast enemies with a projectile from her free hand, all in one fell swoop. For her final of three Siren action skills, Vex can summon copies of herself to do long-range DPS or project a psychic reaper that gets up close to enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">For the curious, you can already sneak a peek at Vex's <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/vex/" rel="nofollow ">full skill trees</a> and get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDE_Jn2K5I&amp;ab_channel=Borderlands">deeper look at some of her skills</a>. You know, just in case you want to start prepping your builds for launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgZvUMgtSs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BzgZvUMgtSs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Gearbox released an animated short called Purple Friday that fills in some of the blanks regarding Vex's backstory. In true Borderlands fashion, the short, which comes in at just over three minutes, is exceptionally bloody and chock full of gags. In it, Vex works a retail job at the series' equivalent of a big-box store when she taps into her Siren powers. Along the way, she falls for a cute guy, is threatened by a customer, and even manages to sneak in what appears to be a joke at Borderlands 3's expense in the middle of the gory affair.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fun little peek at Borderlands 4's world, and there appears to be more of it on the horizon. Gearbox is set to roll out similar videos for the rest of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">playable vault hunters</a>, who can be seen at the tail end of the short around a campfire with Vex.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 launches September 12 and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 later in 2025.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players have been waiting patiently all season for the chance to unlock the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">first obtainable Superman skin in four years</a>, and Friday was supposed to be the day. But the folks at Epic have apparently goofed something up, and most of the new Superman cosmetics, including both versions of the skin, are locked for everyone regardless of whether they own the battle pass.</p><p>Players can unlock the free items--a loading screen, a cape, and a pickaxe--but everything else in Superman's set is stuck. Players who level up enough to unlock some of the items report seeing the normal "you just unlocked these items" splash screen after returning to the lobby, but then the skin, glider, and other items that require the battle pass don't actually appear in the locker.</p><p>Reddit has been inundated with complaints about this--the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx9yqy/i_dont_think_hes_from_dc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">front</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx7wgz/this_superman_parachute_looksstrange_to_me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">page</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx74vg/so_even_after_i_had_gotten_the_glider_it_doesnt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lxa7jn/i_leveled_up_and_claimed_the_skin_but_nothing_but/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/hot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FortniteBR subreddit</a> is covered in posts about this topic. Despite how widespread the issue appears to be--I'm also experiencing this phenomenon myself--Epic has not yet publicly acknowledged the problem on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@FortniteStatus</a>, though there is a page about in <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Gameplay/why-did-i-not-receive-superman-rewards-in-fortnite-after-unlocking-them-a000095274?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Epic's self-service support portal</a>. It's possible the lack of a public response is due to Epic's summer break, when most of the company's employees are on vacation--Friday being the final business day of the break. [<strong>Update: </strong>Epic has now <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1943747417863590259" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged</a> the problem, though it hasn't offered a timeline for a fix.]</p><p>It remains a frustrating turn of events for fans, particularly for those who have been waiting years for a chance at a new Superman skin. The old Superman skin is permanently locked to the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass, released in 2021, and so this is the first time newer players have had the opportunity to get a Superman skin.</p><p>Alongside the new Superman skin, Epic released a pair of other characters from the new film in the item shop on Thursday, though the much-requested Lex Luthor was not among them. Instead, we got skins for the villainous Engineer, and the scene-stealing Mister Terrific, and both of them will be available in the shop until July 24.</p><p>Cosmetics aren't the only exciting aspect of Fortnite's newest collaboration with DC. Epic added on Friday a new Superman mythic item to Battle Royale and Zero Build, which allows one person per match to turn into a fully powered Superman who can fly around and melt folks with his heat vision. And after next week's major patch, Superman's Fortress of Solitude will be added to the island as well.</p>

                <p>Road to Glory is the default game mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. It allows you to create your own player and work your way from high school to college, simulating all of the challenges and triumphs in that journey. When you're first making your player, you can select a position for them to play. Naturally, the most popular position that most players will select, is quarterback. If you were one of the many players who chose to play as a quarterback, one of the first questions you'll have is which Archetype is best for that position in College Football 26.</p><p>Below, you can see an explanation for the QB Archetypes and which one we recommend picking.</p><h2>All QB Archetypes in College Football 26</h2><p>In total, there are four QB Archetypes you can select in Road to Glory. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses, and you don't have to conform to the playstyle that the Archetype outlines. As you progress in Road to Glory, you'll be able to unlock abilities and increase attributes that can make your quarterback a true jack-of-all-trades.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean that your initial Archetype choice isn't important. This determines your playstyle for high school and the early parts of college. Your choice could also have an impact on what school you choose to attend, as one school might have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">offensive playbook</a> that plays more into the play style of your Archetype.</p><p>You can see all four QB Archetypes in Road to Glory below:</p><ul><li><strong>Pocket Passer QB</strong> - This Archetype follows in the footsteps of quarterbacks such as Joe Burrow, Peyton Manning, and Cade Klubnik. You'll primarily throw the ball from a stationary pocket and not worry about creating plays with your legs.</li><li><strong>Dual Threat QB</strong> - This Archetype is a blend of the Pocket Passer and Pure Runner Archetype. You'll be strong with your arm as well as your legs, forcing defenses to account for you as a passer and a runner.</li><li><strong>Backfield Creator QB</strong> - This Archetype is modeled after quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Drake Maye. You won't be considered an overt threat as a runner past the line of scrimmage, but you have a keen ability to extend plays in the backfield by averting pressure and delivering an accurate throw.</li><li><strong>Pure Runner QB</strong> - This Archetype gives you plenty of speed, quickness, and agility to be a better rusher than passer. While quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson can still be lethal through the air, their top strength lies in their ability to run with the ball and make plays with their legs.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530446" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530446"></a><figcaption>All four QB Archetypes in Road to Glory</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, all four Archetypes are quite different from one another, but which is the best one to select if you just want the most dominant quarterback in Road to Glory?</p><h2>Best QB Archetype in Road to Glory</h2><p>When picking a QB Archetype in Road to Glory, you have to remember a couple of key factors. First, your quarterback won't be a strong passer when they first start out in college, regardless of whether you select the Pocket Passer QB Archetype or not. Unless you're playing on an easy difficulty and choose to be a five-star recruit, you won't have the best passing stats or arm strength to effectively throw the ball all over the field.</p><p>Second, every QB Archetype starts out with some kind of passing ability. So, even if you pick Pure Runner, that doesn't mean your quarterback won't be able to complete any pass. Pocket Passer isn't the only Archetype that allows you to excel at throwing the ball.</p><p>With all of that in mind, the <strong>best AB Archetype to pick is</strong> <strong>Backfield Creator</strong>. This is very similar to the Scrambler Archetype from CFB 25, which was by far the most popular pick all year in that game. Backfield Creator gives you solid stats all across the board and allows you to go in any direction with your quarterback once you start to level them up.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530437"></a><figcaption>The stats for the Backfield Creator Archetype</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg"></figure><p>You can make plays with your legs, throw the ball downfield, and scramble out of trouble when defensive pressure breaks through. Backfield Creator is somewhat similar to the Dual Threat Archetype, but Dual Threat places a slightly larger emphasis on running with the ball. So, if that's more up your alley, then you can select that Archetype.</p><p>As for Pocket Passer and Pure Runner, these are more niche options that tend to limit your quarterback early on. Selecting either one makes it difficult to become an all-around quarterback until you start to unlock more abilities and attributes.</p><p>Of course, it's your Road to Glory playthrough, so pick whichever QB Archetype you think can excel with and go from there. Once you're done selecting your Archetype, make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-coach-archetype-in-college-football-26-dynasty-mode/1100-6533046/" data-ref-id="1100-6533046">best Coach Archetype for Dynasty</a> mode in CFB 26.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Aaron Keller hears you all and agrees: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> could definitely use more story content right about now, stating that for it to be "firing on all cylinders" it needs to once again make story content a pillar of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller, who serves as Overwatch 2's director, was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM&amp;ab_channel=Jay3">interviewed by content creator Jay3</a> about many aspects of the live game, including the status of a map editor/creator, a looking-for-group function, and the process of creating just one of the game's many heroes. The latter question eventually led to discussion about the state of narrative content in Overwatch 2 and Keller was refreshingly frank about the matter.</p><p dir="ltr">When probed about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/">potential TV series</a>, Keller responded by saying that the team "would love to do that" before springboarding off of the question to address narrative-starved fans. Keller continued, saying that the team sees a lot of sentiment online that "Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that the Overwatch games have always been multiplayer-first, Blizzard has always employed a story team that fleshed out the game's constantly expanding cast. These storytelling efforts encompass many aspects of the game, like sprays, emotes, voice lines, interactions with certain other characters, in-game bios, events, and skins. Outside of the game, it has manifested as comics, novels, and vibrant animated shorts and cinematics, the latter of which Jay3 points out that he misses at one point in the interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller seems to as well, claiming, "For me personally, for us to say Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back," all the while expressing that he and the team know that they used to to put out more animated shorts in the past and want to again. Accordingly, he claims that the team had large ambitions of pursuing story content in Overwatch 2, but then, as is often the case in game development, things went sideways. </p><p dir="ltr">Keller admitted, "To speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it, with the campaign and everything like that. And it didn't work out." When Overwatch 2 was first announced, a major new feature of the then-upcoming sequel was the implementation of a PvE mode complete with a story that would weave together a cohesive campaign featuring a number of the Overwatch cast.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the heavily anticipated PvE mode was detached from Overwatch 2 prior to its launch in 2023, and was eventually scrapped, which prompted "a kind of reset moment" for the game's team. Aspects of it were later salvaged for later updates, like a content pack of PvE missions that was sold to players post-launch. One of Overwatch 2's newest additions,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-stadium-heroes-and-abilities-list/2900-6490/"> the Stadium mode</a>, also adapts the canned PvE mode's skill-progression system into a PvP format that has proven to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/">success</a> with fans of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">But for fans of Overwatch's larger narrative and cast, these additions, as well as constant balance changes and mechanical pivots, have come at the cost of little-to-no in-game story content, let alone cinematics. Keller and the Overwatch team seem to get that though, and want to get back to it, sharing, "It's just there's been a bit of kind of like a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again."</p><p dir="ltr">With the game seemingly in a healthier place these days, Keller's comments could be a positive sign that Overwatch's narrative will be a larger part of the game again in the near future.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It will, however, have what DICE is calling Training. Players will be able to choose between two different Training paths for each class. Training levels up over the course of a match by tackling objectives or engaging in teamplay, after which players gain more passive bonuses unique to the class. Upon reaching level-three Training, players can use an unique active class ability.</p><p dir="ltr">One example of a Training ability shared in the blog post is for the Recon class, which at level three will be able to call in a UAV that automatically spots enemies for a duration. Depending on the Training Path players select, their level-0, level-one, and level-two passive Training abilities will be different, though the level-three active ability will be the same, with only one active ability for each class. Triggering a level-three ability resets Training to level two, after which players will be able to start rebuilding charge on their level three ability.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again using the Recon class as an example, selecting the Sniper Training path grants improved spotting capabilities at level zero all the way to making it so enemies hit with sniper headshots becoming unrevivable at Training-level two. Alternatively, choosing the Pathfinder Training tree makes it so players move more quickly while crouched and prone at level zero and makes it so damaging enemies automatically spots them at level two. You can see the full Recon Training perk tree below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374"></a><figcaption>Each class will have two Training paths to choose from, culminating in an active ability.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Training looks to be a major new system in Battlefield 6--one that DICE states is there to incentivize players to efficiently engage in their chosen role and to promote teamplay.

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 comes loaded with plenty of levels, including every stage from the original versions of both games as well as a few brand-new stages, like Movie Studio and Pinball. However, developer Iron Galaxy actually created several more levels--11, by our count--that you can find via the Create-A-Park mode.</p><p>Select Create-A-Park and you'll see a whole bunch of user-created courses. Thus far, they are ... well, they aren't good, to put it mildly. Most are simply advertising an easy way to earn a few of the game's hardest achievements, and offer little else. However, scroll down and you'll see a "Developer" section, where all the levels were designed by Iron Galaxy itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Now, to be clear, these stages lack the complexity--both visual and mechanical--of the "real" stages in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, but their simplicity and emphasis on performing nearly impossible tricks helps to make them a good contrast after you've had your fill of the others. Iron Galaxy even put in collectables and other goals to make things more interesting, albeit ones that are fairly easy considering the small size of these stages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352"></a><figcaption>Skateboarding is totally legal in whatever dimension this is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg"></figure><p>However, be careful not to select one stage in particular: Torment Nexus. As the name implies, this is not a good time, as you're dropped into a pit full of angry construction workers who will beat you up as you are thrown around on a boost tile like the worst version of Mario Kart. This is why you always wear a helmet.</p><p>For more on Tony Hawk's latest remake, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">THPS 3 + 4 review</a>, this silly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-has-a-very-silly-spongebob-easter-egg/1100-6533063/" data-ref-id="1100-6533063">SpongeBob joke</a>, and how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bam-margera-is-in-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-because-of-a-chance-la-visit/1100-6533110/" data-ref-id="1100-6533110">Bam Margera</a> ended up back on the roster.</p>
