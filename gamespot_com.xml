                <p>After a lengthy stretch of rumors, reports and leaks, the next major installment in the Battlefield franchise is finally being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-trailer-coming-very-soon-see-a-teaser-now/1100-6533340/" data-ref-id="1100-6533340">unveiled on July 24</a>. Before then though, we've received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s first teaser, and things are looking pretty chaotic out there. </p><p>The scattered teaser primarily cuts between several news clips providing a lot of context for the game's inevitable conflict. Of significant note is the trailer's emphasis on the collapse of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is an alliance of existing world militaries. In the broadest sense, this alliance is meant to act as a form of deterrence, both to prevent members from fighting and to prevent outside states from attacking a member.</p><p>Battlefield 6 seems to kick off with an attack on NATO though, with much of the teaser focusing on news reports from all around the world about an attack on a NATO base in Mukhrovani, Georgia. Interspersed between these reports is other alarming news stemming from the fallout of this attack, including the assassination of a secretary general at NATO HQ, a frenzied social media response, and the US president's mobilization of armed forces.</p><p>Throughout, repeated mentions are made to Pax Armata, who appear to be the villainous faction of Battlefield 6 and the perpetrators of the attacks, which can be seen spreading to Belgium and then Gibraltar. The Battlefield X account also makes mention of the organization in the teaser announcement, which reads, "Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks. Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But whoâ€™s pulling the strings and to what end?"</p><p>The teaser stresses the modern setting of the latest Battlefield game, which was recently confirmed by leakers and eventually EA. The series has been all over the timeline recently, with Battlefield 2042 taking place in the near future while the game before it, Battlefield V, took place during World War 2.</p><p>It won't be long before we learn more about Battlefield 6's gameplay and setting, seeing as the reveal is set for July 24. Additionally, EA and Battlefield Studios have shared that there will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">open beta</a> ahead of the game's release where it is expected to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows may come to more platforms beyond PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. As part of the company's latest earnings briefing, CEO Yves Guillemot discussed what's next for the game, saying fans can look forward to the Claws of Awaji expansion this October and then "we also have some new versions that will come to other machines."</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/after-switch-2-listing-ubisoft-confirms-assassins-creed-shadows-for-other-machines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC reported</a> that Guillemot was also asked specifically about the company's plans for Switch 2. He said Ubisoft "hasn't said" which games it's bringing to Switch 2, but some believe Shadows could be among them.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listing on PEGI's website</a> suggested that Shadows may come to Switch 2, but nothing is confirmed as of yet. Ubisoft has, however, already announced that Star Wars Outlaws is headed to Switch 2 on September 4.</p><p>Shadows launched in March and has reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">5 million players so far</a>. The game has so far "performed in line with expectations," Ubisoft said.</p><p>The game was released on March 20, following multiple delays to help the team<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/" data-ref-id="1100-6528995"> have enough time to polish the game up to its standards.</a></p><p>In other Ubisoft news, Guillemot recently announced that his son, Charlie Guillemot, will become the co-CEO of the new Ubisoft company that will manage its key franchises. Charlie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">pushed back against nepotism concerns</a>. "Yes, I'm Yves' son. That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment," he said.</p>
