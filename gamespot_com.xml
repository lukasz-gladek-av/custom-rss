                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario was released in Japan 25 years ago today, August 11, 2025. Below, we look back at how the dynamic battle system and an unusual approach to Mario lore influenced the series for years to come.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I would wager that when GameSpot posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-preview/1100-2544763/">its first preview of the original Paper Mario</a>--then known as "Super Mario Adventure" in the US and "Super Mario RPG 2" in Japan--two and a half decades ago, no one expected it would become a beloved sub-series that people would still hold in high regard a quarter-century later.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, here we are, exactly 25 years ago to the day that Paper Mario first hit store shelves in Japan. While the majority of Paper Mario fans dote on Thousand-Year Door as the best game in the long-running series, I've always held a special fondness for the original that started it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario tells a story both conventional and fresh. By all accounts, it's a very by-the-books Mario tale: Bowser has procured a magical artifact of unfathomable power, captured Princess Peach, and scattered seven star-shaped MacGuffins around the world that Mario must retrieve in an epic quest to defeat him. There are no huge, defining character moments, no mind-bending plot twists. Just safe, simple Mario fare.</p><p dir="ltr">But also in typical Mario fashion, the simple concept is enhanced by its execution. What could be a bog-standard trek through a desert is enriched by a pitstop at a local outpost, where Mario must find the descendant of a band of thieves who can unlock the path to an ancient temple. Before he can climb a snowy mountain, he must first prove that he's not the culprit of a penguin murder mystery (it, uh, makes sense in context). The journey features just enough bells and whistles to help it stand out from the plumber's platforming escapades.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the game really shines is in its characterizations. Continuing the precedent set by its predecessor, Super Mario RPG, Paper Mario breathed life into the Mario universe that was still relatively unseen up to that point. For the first time, we get to see what exactly Princess Peach does while waiting for Mario to rescue her from Bowser. Far from being a helpless damsel in distress, she's bold and proactive, working to assist Mario in his quest long-distance however she can, typically by sneaking around and relaying information as to where he needs to go next. Bowser is a bigger threat than ever before, using the power of the fabled Star Rod to become virtually invincible. Yet, after stomping Mario and sending him plummeting to certain doom, what's the first thing he does? Write about it in his diary like a giddy schoolgirl. He's a terrifying threat and absolute goofball in equal measure, a memorable portrayal of the classic game villain that subsequent games and even the animated movie have built upon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6wQzSVIwYZI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's emphasis on character is well demonstrated in Toad Town, the game's hub area. With Toads in modern Mario titles, if you've seen one, you've basically seen them all. Not so here. Despite relatively similar appearances between them, dozens of Toad Town residents have unique personalities, from the couple by the fountain who always find some way to connect their love for one another to Mario's adventure to the family trying to deal with the shift in the family dynamic due to the father figure being out of a job until Princess Peach's castle is restored. The characters don't remain static, either. Their dialogue is constantly changing as Mario's journey progresses to reflect the current state of the world around them. This makes it feel like there's more to the player's journey than simply saving a princess. This time, they're saving a living, breathing world full of unique, charming characters and families--people they can actually care about.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's the portrayal of the Mushroom Kingdom's non-Toad residents where the game shines brightest. Paper Mario solidified the concept of commonplace Mario creatures having vastly different appearances, personalities, and even allegiances, an aspect of the franchise that fans have clamored to see return for decades. Super Mario RPG toyed with the concept of Bowser's minions like Goombas and Koopa Troopas defecting from his forces and living their lives on their own terms, and Paper Mario takes that concept a step further. The first characters Mario meets when beginning his journey is a family of Goombas, with no ties to Bowser whatsoever, who help nurse him back to health. Other characters, like the rich young Boo heiress Bow or the wannabe Lakitu punk Lakilester, bring fresh new designs and personalities to what were formerly very one-note Mario creatures. Best of all, they can join you as partners on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">It's these partner characters who help make Paper Mario's RPG battle system so dynamic. Make contact with an enemy in the overworld, and a turn-based battle is initiated. While Mario avails himself of a variety of familiar jump and hammer attacks to dispatch his foes, his partners back him up with their own unique abilities. For example, Goombario specializes in headbonking enemies into unconsciousness, whereas Bombette prefers to blow her opponents up with a full-frontal assault. Enemy placement and type forces players to strategize, switching up their moves and partner characters for whatever--and whoever--is the best fit for each battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphics aside, the original Paper Mario still holds up astonishingly well. It's every bit as charming and fun to play as it was when it first released back in 2000. Its simple but engaging story and gameplay make it the perfect entry point for new RPG players and Mario fans alike. With almost every Mario RPG surrounding it having gotten a remake in recent years (including the fantastic Thousand-Year Door remake that fixed what relatively few flaws the original game had), it's certainly not an unreasonable desire for Paper Mario to receive the same treatment. Regardless of whether the game gets remade someday or remains available in its current form, any gamer who has never given the original Paper Mario a shot owes it to themselves to experience a timeless piece of Mario magic that continues to resonate 25 years later.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NintendoMovies on YouTube</a></em></p>

Some believe people may spend more conservatively on all range of products, including entertainment like games, which could negatively impact the video game industry overall.</p><p>Now, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on this economic backdrop, saying the US economy is neither booming nor busting, going on to predict that consumers will be more choosy when it comes to the games they buy. Zelnick said Take-Two is well-positioned here because, in his belief, the company makes must-have games.</p>

Thankfully, the patch notes state that shade can be found as well as sunscreen and parasols as part of the Mesa update, which is available now for the co-op game. </p><p dir="ltr">Developers Aggro Crab and Landfall broke down the major update for Peak <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. For the next week, Mesa will actually replace the Alpine biome in runs, and then afterward, they "will rotate randomly." Sunscreen and parasols aren't the only new items in the update. Other additions include aloe vera, scout cannon, and dynamite. There are also a couple of mysteries that aren't detailed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Along with the Mesa biome, the update introduces the Bug Phobia Mode for people who don't want to see spiders and other multi-legged insects on their climbing runs. You can also now navigate Peak's settings with a controller, and the developers are promising better performance in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This major update comes just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/">Peak added cannibalism</a>, which the developers jokingly said was a "totally normal update." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/">Peak exploded on Steam</a> in June, seeing over 100,000 concurrent players after launching. The game sees players working together (or even alone) to scale a mountain at the center of an island that changes daily. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/">Jealousy was actually one of the driving forces</a> for making the game.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h3 dir="ltr">PATCH NOTES v1.20.a</h3><h4 dir="ltr">FEATURES</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Added a new biome that replaces the Alpine: the MESA.
