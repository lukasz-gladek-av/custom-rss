It has rubberized grips with a leather-like texture, which makes the controller feel slightly different than other Xbox Wireless Controllers with textured grips. On each side of the Xbox Guide button, you'll find two 3D "spikes" to mimic Doomguy's helmet. Since Doomguy is always slaying demons, the controller has streaks of blood and "chips" in the paint.</p><p>The Doom Slayer armor theme extends to the controls as well. The left stick is gray, while the right is red to align with Doomguy's chest port. Instead of ABXY labels, each face button is marked by a letter from the Sentinel alphabet. The triggers and bumpers are green on the left and silver on the right.</p><p>Inside the box, you'll find a voucher to redeem the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin in The Dark Ages. When you get the controller, remove the battery cover for a neat Easter Egg.</p><p>Like all Xbox Wireless Controllers from Microsoft, the Doom-themed model works wirelessly on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and mobile.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Xbox Wireless Controller (Limited Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png"></figure><p>Along with Doom: The Dark Ages, fans can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOOM-Anthology-Steam-PC-Other-System/dp/B0DCHS3FJB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on Doom Anthology</a>, which compiles six Doom games in one package with a steelbook case and a miniature BFG for display.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer that may give fans of The Witcher some Deja vu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHH6xQT2-dw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There's no English language audio option for this video, but the closed captioning does offer an English translation of the spoken lines. The woman's name is Myoan, and she's a shaman who performs a violent sacrificial rite with a snake. Woochi is the man who confronts Myoan at her dark shrine before she transforms into a monster before his eyes. Woochi isn't defenseless and the manifestation of his sword is impressive. However, Myoan overpowers Woochi before declaring, "Proclaim it to Heaven, we rise again."</p><p>The game is set durning Korea's Joseon era, and Jeon Woochi is said to be a man "who uses his powers to fight injustice and trick the corrupt." This is a single-player game built with Unreal Engine 5 by developer LoreVault Studio. The announcement notes the dev team is currently consulting experts on Korean literature and traditional music, while also scouting locations that will be used to recreate the period setting of the game. The game's music will be composed by Jung Jae-il, whose previous credits include Squid Game and Parasite.</p><p>Nexon Games hasn't set a release date yet for Woochi the Wayfarer, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-20083">Warhammer 40: Dawn of War's</a> original opening cinematic has been remastered a second time in order to restore a "beloved" Space Marine scream that, to the dismay of fans, had been removed the first time around.</p><p dir="ltr">When developer Relic Entertainment first announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remaster-of-one-of-warhammer-40ks-best-games-is-just-a-month-away-with-discount-for-loyal-fans/1100-6533148/" data-ref-id="1100-6533148">August 14 release date for Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a>--an updated version of the RTS classic that includes features like upscaled unit textures, lighting upgrades, and 4K resolution support--it did so by releasing a new, remastered version of the original's iconic opening cinematic. The CGI trailer shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens battling against an Orkish horde in a desperate last stand against all odds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HiUectTy9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2HiUectTy9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a well-loved cinematic, largely because at the time it was released in 2004, it was one of the first great looks at the Warhammer 40K universe in action. The remastered cinematic (the first time it was put out) was nearly identical to the original aside from the higher-definition visuals, except for one notable exception--the scream of a Space Marine charging into battle had been removed and replaced with voice over from a different character entirely, that of Blood Ravens Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos.</p><p dir="ltr">That didn't sit well with fans, who complained about the scream's absence and its lore-breaking replacement in the comments for the trailer on YouTube. Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> amidst the outcry, Relic seemed to have been caught off-guard by upset fans and said the Space Marine's "roar was even more beloved than we realized." Relic then teased it would have "something for OG roar enjoyers soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Now, the remastered cinematic has been uploaded once again, this time with the original audio. The Space Marine's battle cry has been restored to its previous glory, and Dawn of War fans can (hopefully) now rest easy, assured that an iconic part of Warhammer 40K video game history has been properly preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"We heard you!" the description of the new original audio trailer reads. "We've re-released the enhanced trailer with the original audio. The iconic roar is back to celebrate launch week. Are you ready to serve...again?"</p><p dir="ltr">Dawn of War - Definitive Edition arrives August 14 and will be $30, with "loyal fans" who own the game's previous anniversary edition receiving a 30% discount, putting the price at around $21. The Definitive Edition includes a remastered version of the original game along with all three of the game's expansions, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm, which each include an additional campaign and fan-favorite factions like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p>

Players were finding their progress halted by invisible walls as they climbed the new clime. The good news: it's fixed!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players began to report the invisible wall issue almost immediately, and the game's Discord was filled with complaints about the bug. Now, though, developer Team PEAK and publisher AggroCrab have released a new update to fix the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're working on a fix for the invisible walls in the mesa‼️ Keep an eye out for a patch soon 💀🙏 Thanks for the patience yall <a href="https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM</a></p>  — AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Less than an hour after they acknowledged the issue, though, an end to our long nightmare was in sight.</p><p>Peak hit Steam in July to critical and fan acclaim, marrying the silly goofs of games like R.E.P.O. with some seriously fun cooperative climbing. This new update adds the "Mesa" biome to the game, which temporarily replaces the Alpine biome, and will eventually go into rotation alongside it. Where the Alpine level was a chilly place with freezing winds and icy rocks, the Mesa is a sun-baked little world where sunscreen and umbrellas aren't just a suggestion but a requirement to survive. This new biome has it all: cactuses, tumbleweeds, a deadly sun, and tornadoes that will send you flying.</p><p>This new update has more people playing today than any time since Peak launched (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), so this quick fix will be appreciated by many fans and newcomers.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> features dozens of different celebrations that your players can perform after making a big play on the field. From scoring a touchdown to recording an interception to just making a first down, you'll be able to celebrate quite often during a game. However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>
