                <p dir="ltr">Today, Nintendo released its next Nintendo Direct presentation focused solely on Kirby Air Riders, the next project from Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai. Before diving into the details on Kirby's next adventure, Sakurai gave a peek behind the development curtain with a particularly interesting line--he was worried a new Kirby Air Riders would be too much like Nintendo's other racing franchise, Mario Kart.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai made the comment during the beginning of the presentation, as he mentioned to both Nintendo corporate president Shinya Takahashi and then-president of HAL Laboratory Satoshi Mitsuhara that there are similarities between Air Riders and Mario Kart. As Sakurai himself said in the presentation, "OK, so it is basically Mario Kart."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QtkHiB7WKf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I even mentioned this when I received the request to make the game," Sakurai said. "I asked them if they still wanted to do it, but as fans of the original know, the appeal of the game is actually not the races!"</p><p dir="ltr">The 45-minute deep dive into Kirby Air Riders revealed many details about the upcoming racer, including the characters and vehicles players will be racing with, as well as the floating island of Skyah that serves as the game's setting. Multiple modes, including City Trial with up to 16 players, were also detailed during the presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders will launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Facing mounting pressure from lawmakers and a newly filed lawsuit by the state of Louisiana, Roblox recently issued a lengthy statement addressing what it calls “erroneous claims and misconceptions.” But reports suggest the Louisiana lawsuit is just the tip of what will eventually be a very large legal iceberg, as the platform faces rampant allegations that it has failed to protect the young people who make up the majority of its playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">Roblox is a wildly popular game creation platform that hosts user-made games like Dress to Impress (which recently launched a collaboration with pop icon Lady Gaga), Grow a Garden, and Brookhaven. It sees tens of millions of daily active users (reported numbers vary between 82 and 111 million), and almost 40% of its playerbase is children under the age of 13. As such, it has faced intense scrutiny amid several reports (including a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive one published by Bloomberg last year</a>) that allege the platform does not do enough to protect children.</p><p dir="ltr">On August 15, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">just days after California Congressman Ro Khanna said</a>, "Roblox is simply not doing enough to protect our kids, to inform parents, and to go after child predators,” the <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322" rel="nofollow ">state of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against the company</a>. The lawsuit, which was brought in the 21st Judicial District of Louisiana, alleges that Roblox:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><em>Has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana’s children.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to implement basic safety controls to protect child users from predators.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to provide notice to parents and child users of its dangers.</em></li></ul><p dir="ltr">In October of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings" rel="nofollow ">Roblox introduced “parent accounts”</a> to the platform, which allow parents to manage their child’s account, including blocking people on their friends list. However, a recent petition demanding Roblox do more, statements from politicians like Khanna, and the Louisiana lawsuit all suggest these steps are not enough.</p><p dir="ltr">An<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow "> August</a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> 18 Wired </a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow ">report</a> says a group of law firms across the United States plans to file "a flood of lawsuits" in the near future, "all for clients who accuse the platform of allegedly facilitating the sexual exploitation of and grooming of their kids." One lawyer who spoke to Wired, Matt Dolman from Dolman Law Group, said his firm has "about 300 of these cases," and expects there to be over 1,000 lawsuits filed "by this time next year." Dolman said the majority of his Roblox clients are under the age of 16, and more than half are young girls.</p><p dir="ltr">There are already several lawsuits that have been filed against Roblox, including <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/john-doe-v-roblox-and-discord-jury-trial-demanded.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one in Alabama</a> filed this past July after a 14-year-old girl allegedly met a predator on Roblox, began chatting with him on the messaging app Discord, and was reportedly abducted and assaulted. The lawsuit names both Roblox and Discord as defendants.</p><p dir="ltr">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill in a statement that accompanied the Louisiana lawsuit filing.</p><p dir="ltr">That same day, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit" rel="nofollow ">Roblox issued a lengthy statement on its website</a>, which begins with the caveat that the company does not usually comment on pending litigation, but wanted to “address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record.”</p><p dir="ltr">The statement cites Roblox’s safety tools, which the company says it is “constantly innovating,” its “industry-leading stance on age-based communication,” its “suite of easy-to-use parental controls,” and past collaborations with law enforcement, among other things, as examples of its dedication to child safety.</p><p dir="ltr">“We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users,” the statement reads.</p><p dir="ltr">Dolman told Wired there is "a working group" of lawyers from several law firms who have already spoken to several clients accusing Roblox of failing to protect their children.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Roblox for comment.</p>

But if you're looking for a throwback fighting-game experience, the fan-made Pokemon: Close Combat has an update of its own. Since its launch in 2023, Close Combat has gradually increased its roster of fighting-type Pokemon. And now, the latest fighter has been added to Pokemon: Close Combat with a reveal trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsHSilysdDg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PsHSilysdDg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marshadow isn't just a fighter, but also a ghost-type mythical Pokemon. His powers include the ability to suck out the soul of another fighter and use it to summon a Marshadow doppelganger for a double-team attack. Marshadow is also equipped with a number of distance and close-quarters attacks that can overpower unsuspecting enemies.</p><p>The team behind Pokemon: Close Combat has also shared <a href="https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Pokemon:_Close_Combat/Patch_Notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the latest patch notes for this update</a>. The gameplay tweaks primarily include quality-of-life adjustments as well as bug fixes. With the addition of Marshadow, Close Combat now has a total of 20 available fighters.</p><p>This week has already proven to be eventful for Pokemon fans, with the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-mega-evolutions-this-fall-new-cards-revealed/1100-6534032/" data-ref-id="1100-6534032">Mega Evolutions in Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> as well as new cards.

Dubbed the Sega Villains Stage, details are still pretty light on the DLC, but Sonic the Hedgehog's Dr. Eggman is set to appear as a boss fight. Alongside that, protagonist Joe Musashi will have two other guest villains to take on, though they are yet to be revealed. If you're picking up the digital deluxe edition of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, you'll automatically unlock it whenever the DLC does arrive next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega also announced that Young Dirty Bastard (YDB), i.e. the son of the late Ol' Dirty Bastard from Wu-Tang Clan, is releasing a song called The Path Has Just Begun inspired by the Shinobi series. It'll be released on streaming services this week, August 21, and you can expect a new trailer for the game on the same day.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">teased back at The Game Awards in 2023</a> before getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-reveals-new-shinobi-game-art-of-vengance-during-february-2025s-state-of-play/1100-6529458/" data-ref-id="1100-6529458">proper reveal earlier this year</a>, bringing the series back to its roots with 2D action-platforming. It's also the first new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi 3D, a 3DS title that received average reviews at the time. This new Shinobi game comes as part of a broader move by Sega to bring back some of its legacy titles that haven't received a new entry in many years, like Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. A movie adaptation of the Shinobi series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sega-arcade-game-lands-director-for-a-new-movie/1100-6527028/">also in the works</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to pick up Shinobi: Art of Vengeance on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC when it launches on August 29.</p>

The video in question showed "something specific" that will make sense once Black Ops 7 is unveiled in more detail today, August 19, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6534003/" data-ref-id="1100-6534003">during Gamescom</a>, the account said.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another reputable insider, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957613059356217831" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, said on social media that "it's not jetpacks lol." Instead, what's seen in the video is a "mega jump upgrade from the campaign," apparently.</p><p>The original video <a href="https://x.com/tu_nikal_/status/1957655348481012029" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains online if you know where to look.</a></p><p>More details about Black Ops 7 should be announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live today beginning at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. Some of the surprises may have been spoiled already, though, including this gameplay video and the game's reported price and release date. According to reliable source <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1957017550044168449" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, the game will be priced at $70 for its standard edition and will launch on November 14.</p><p>The price being below $70 is not a surprise, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">already did a U-turn on its plans to charge $80 for games this year.</a> Like Black Ops 6 in 2024, Black Ops 7 will be available at launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>Black Ops 7's development is being led by Raven Software and Treyarch, the same two co-lead developers on last year's Black Ops 6. This is the first time ever that Activision is releasing Black Ops games in consecutive years.</p><p>Recently, a report said Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final campaign mission will morph into a 32-player extraction-style multiplayer mode.</a></p><p>If the rumored November 14 release date for Black Ops 7 is real, that's about a month after EA's highly anticipated Battlefield 6 is set to launch on October 10. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">just wrapped up its second and final open beta test</a>, and it was hugely popular.</p>

                <p>In November, the Xbox Series X|S console will have been around for five years. Naturally, there has been talk about the next generation of Xbox consoles, and Microsoft recently spoke about what it envisions for its future hardware and its idea of a player-first environment that will follow players across multiple devices.</p><p>Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald explained how the company is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem across multiple devices in the future. "When we think about the future of the Xbox, we're really focused on how do we put the player at the center of the experience, and when you really look at how modern players play games today, the vast majority play across multiple different devices," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the VP, Microsoft envisions players having options like the Xbox ROG Ally for when they're on the move, and dedicated hardware when they come home that'll allow them to pick up from right where they left off.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said. "So it's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center."</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">what we do know about the next-gen Xbox</a> is that it'll be powered by AMD technology, which Microsoft says will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" that's "enhanced" with the power of AI. The company also hinted at games not being "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, and in February, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the in-development console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><p>On the handheld side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">the Xbox ROG Ally will launch during the holiday season</a> and there'll be two models to choose from. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, while the base model ROG Xbox Ally is white and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Pricing for these units haven't been officially revealed yet, but recent leaks claim that the premium "X" model could cost as much as $1,050, while the ROG Xbox Ally is rumored to be $699.</p>
