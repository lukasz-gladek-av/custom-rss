          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpg-ps5/2900-6701/" data-ref-id="2900-6701">best RPGs on PS5</a> will soon be available in a convenient new bundle, as the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Rebirth Twin Pack Physical Edition</a> is set to arrive on December 4. Its name is a mouthful, but it's shaping up to be the easiest way for players to catch up on the first two entries in the planned trilogy. It's only releasing for PS5, but preorders should be opening soon--and we're expecting the twin pack to be quite popular.</p><p>There are a few caveats with this cool bundle. For one, there's some confusion with its release date and preorders. The official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-physical-edition-now-available-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix blog</a> says the Twin Pack is "now available," while its <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1976271756118868009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> accounts claim it's dropping on December 4. The latter is clearly the correct date, but unfortunately, no preorders have opened. Folks in the UK and Europe might have some luck on the Square Enix Store, but the <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">link</a> for North America currently leads to a lovely 404 error.</p><p>At any rate, we're hoping to see it at additional retailers in the future, though no plans have been made official by Square Enix. It's also unclear if it'll eventually launch on platforms beyond PS5. The trilogy has been confirmed to arrive on Switch and Xbox (starting with Remake Intergrade on January 22), but there's no mention as to whether this Twin Pack is included in the multiplatform plans. Hopefully things become clearer as we get closer to its December 4 release.</p><p>Can't wait until December to dive in? You can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> for $40 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rebirth</a> for $50 at Amazon. The latter comes with an Amazon-exclusive Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PS5 controller skin, featuring both Cloud and Sephiroth.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-big-deal-days-best-movie-deals-4k-blu-rays-available-now/1100-6535093/">Grab 4K Blu-Rays For Under $13: Inception, The Shining, Blade Runner, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-movie-4k-blu-ray-special-edition-steelbook-the-film-vault/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New Numbered Limited Edition Is Up For Grabs At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
