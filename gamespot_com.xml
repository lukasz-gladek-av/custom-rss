It replaced the ARPG's straightforward battle pass system with a more confusing one that broke rewards into multiple different categories. Players have complained about fewer rewards and less premium currency offered as part of the overhauled system, even if Reliquaries do technically give players more control and agency over which rewards to target.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As highlighted by Loika on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/i_think_its_devious_of_blizz_to_put_buy_with/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> and broken down by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/is-diablo-4s-new-reliquary-battle-pass-predatory-377282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the issues with the Reliquary system actually go deeper. While players can earn "favor" tokens for free while playing to unlock some rewards, the game also prominently presents the option to buy those same rewards with Diablo 4's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">In the example screenshot Loika gives, one set of armor can be redeemed for 15 tokens or 750 Platinum (roughly $7.50). The option to spend Platinum is featured prominently in the middle of the screen, and spending Platinum can be done without a confirmation screen. It's easy to see how players might accidentally click the wrong button one time and suddenly be out $7.50.</p><p dir="ltr">Another player points out in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/comment/mxcvm69/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> how when using a controller, the button used to claim rewards with tokens or buy with Platinum actually changes. Initially, the left face button is used to "Claim" a reward, but upon pressing the button, another menu appears where "Claim with Favor Token" instead moves to a different button and purchase with Platinum is instead on the left face button. This issue was corroborated by GameSpot. Once again, it's easy to see how someone just clicking through the menus could easily spend money without meaning to.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's bundle system is also drawing criticism. Players can purchase individual premium Reliquaries separately for 500 Platinum or 1,500 Platinum for all three. However, the game offers a "Battle Pass Bundle" (confusingly named, since the battle pass terminology is no longer found anywhere else in the game) that nets players all three premium Reliquaries for 1,000 Platinum. Buying the bundle is definitely the way to go and saves players 500 Platinum, but if a player already bought one Reliquary (whether intentionally or by accident) they become locked out of the 1,000 Platinum bundle and instead are forced to buy each Reliquary individually. That means players who purchase one Reliquary but then later decides they want the others are essentially forced to spend an extra $5.</p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle. One might think that for 2,800 Platinum (nearly triple the price of the standard bundle) that the number of new rewards would be significant, but that's not the case. The Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle grants instant access to an armor set already available in the standard bundle, as well as two additional rewards--a pet and a pair of wing cosmetics. That means players are spending an extra 1,800 Platinum, nearly $20, for just two minor cosmetic items.</p><p dir="ltr">During a recent Campfire Chat livestream, Blizzard stated it has heard "overwhelming feedback" about the Reliquary system and is looking to improve it, but that changes won't be coming in Season 9. Diablo director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher further elaborated in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kt05z4/comment/mtsld3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit comment</a> that the goal of the Reliquary system is "to add something for all players and not just paid." Additionally, Fletcher said for future IP collabs Blizzard will look to bring "better options and value, so players aren't only given some higher priced tier options and are left with that only." That came in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, which was largely just an opportunity to buy high-priced cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Blizzard releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a>, players already know what to expect for the rest of the year in terms of new content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">Diablo 4 Season 9 will let players craft their own spells</a>, including one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-may-introduce-a-game-changing-teleport-spell-if-blizzard-doesnt-nerf-it/1100-6531986/" data-ref-id="1100-6531986">teleport spell that might be a tad overpowered</a>. Another IP crossover is also slated for later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion, however, isn't coming until 2026</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Prior to the official launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">Borderlands 4 preorders</a>, most of the questions were about how much the game was going to cost. But perhaps the questions players should have been asking were about the game's system requirements. Gearbox has disclosed the PC specs for Borderlands 4, and they're pretty eye-popping. But the requirements may not be as strict as they initially appear.</p><p>The specs were shared earlier today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Borderlands 4's Steam page</a>, and the stats are reproduced below.</p><p>Recommend:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 32 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Minimum:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Though it looks like there isn't much wiggle room for the storage, the 64-bit processor, and the 8 CPU Cores, there may be some for the processor and graphics chips. As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/borderlands-4-system-requirements-demand-8-cpu-cores-and-8-gb-of-vram-but-the-reality-is-probably-a-bit-more-forgiving-than-that/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, the minimum requirements would accept an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, which can't support ray tracing like the Nvidia RTX 2070. That suggests ray tracing support isn't necessary for the graphics chip. The outlet also suggests that the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X CPU should be good enough to run Borderlands 4, even though it isn't listed in the minimum specs. Both lists require SSD storage between 8-12 GB VRAM for the graphics.</p><p>Earlier this week, Gearbox disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">post-launch plans for Borderlands 4</a>, but if you want the new Vault Hunters then you'll have to pay for the $130 Super Deluxe Edition. It's currently unclear if Gearbox will sell the new additions as standalone DLC. There will also be additional storylines and side missions as well Bounty Packs that introduce new areas and missions that will lead to unique boss fights and the chance to earn more loot. Bounty Packs will be included with both the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> on September 12.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is launching a fourth battle royale mode with its June 18 update--Blitz Royale, a smaller scale version of BR with 32 players and rounds intended to last five minutes or less. While Epic Games is pushing Blitz Royale as being geared toward mobile players, the mode is playable on every platform Fortnite works on. Blitz Royale is available in solos and four-players squads, and is zero build only.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165"></a><figcaption>Blitz Royale will be Fortnite's quickest battle royale mode yet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg"></figure><p>So how does it work? Well, it's a no-builds version of battle royale on a much smaller map than the main Fortnite island. But this isn't a tiny version of regular Fortnite Battle Royale. All players will start each match with a boon and/or weapon--everybody in a given round will get the same item--and as they survive and eliminate enemy players, they'll increase their Blitz Level, which immediately grants more weapons and gear at each level.</p><p dir="ltr">The new mode is bringing some free cosmetics with it, including a new skin, the Blitz Knight. To unlock the Blitz Knight, you'll need to either gain 15 levels once Blitz Royale goes live, or place in the top ten in 20 different Blitz rounds. There's also, of course, a unique victory umbrella glider, the Blitz Brella, that you can earn by winning three Blitz matches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKYynyozO8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uKYynyozO8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Blitz Royale is not a permanent mode, at least not yet. Initially, the mode is set to last just for the next four weeks, and will go away on July 15. Though it's clear that Epic would like for Blitz Royale to stick around, they'll presumably want to see both how well it does and how it affects the player populations of the existing modes before committing long term.</p><p dir="ltr">While it'll only stick around for four weeks, each of those weeks will have a wildly different theme and loot pool. After launch week, Blitz Royale will be themed after Avatar: The Last Airbender for Week 2, which will bring back those bending scrolls that were introduced in Chapter 5 Season 2. Week 3 will be full of weapons from the main Battle Royale mode that were dropped from bosses, like Thorne's Vampiric Blade, and the TMNT-themed Week 4 will be all about punching folks, with a loot pool full of melee weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big week for Fortnite. In addition to Blitz Royale, the June 18 update includes a new Fortnite Festival Season <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bruno-mars-is-your-next-fortnite-festival-headliner/1100-6532488/" data-ref-id="1100-6532488">with Bruno Mars headlining</a>, and a permanent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expeditions-is-the-co-op-action-adventure-mode-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6532482/" data-ref-id="1100-6532482">new co-op Lego mode</a>.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When most people say their game is retro, they mean a particular era of game ranging from the NES to the PlayStation. That timespan encompasses the heyday of pixel-art gameplay and the burgeoning 3D revolution. It's not common for games to look even further back for their inspirations, to the earliest days of home console gaming. But that's exactly what Adventure of Samsara does, and it makes for a curious blend of motifs and mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara itself has a relatively long history. The game was pitched as a Kickstarter project in 2016, under the name <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774101425/tower-of-samsara" rel="nofollow ">Tower of Samsara</a>. It had set a modest (and very precise, numerically) goal of $48,561, but failed to achieve a third of that number. That may have been the end of the story, as just another indie game that never got off the ground. But Brazilian studio Ilex Games continued to pitch it until landing at Atari, where it morphed into a sci-fi offshoot of the classic Atari 2600 game Adventure. Adventure of Samsara is a marriage of the two, an Atari spokesperson told me--the game is as Ilex originally envisioned it, but it has weaved in story elements from Adventure to make it part of that universe.</p><p dir="ltr">That blend of inspirations means that it carries visual similarities to an Atari 2600 game. The pixel art is large and blocky and visual elements carry a flat layer of color that looks reminiscent of those early video games, while also looking much more advanced and modern than anything the original Atari could have produced. This is a retro pixel-art throwback, but the look is striking by being modeled after and modernizing such an early version of pixel art.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bta4dx3sgYc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bta4dx3sgYc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, the movement and combat itself feels reminiscent of Adventure or Prince of Persia, or for a somewhat more modern reference point, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. Everything from your walk cycle to the swing of your swords is deliberate and chunky, matching the visual style. A parry system rewards quick reflexes with a powerful strikeback, which is extremely necessary given the methodical movement of the hero.</p><p dir="ltr">And within this context it's a metroidvania, consisting of a wide-open map to explore as you unlock more tools and options. I only got to play a short guided demo, with an Atari rep directing me where to go to maximize what I could squeeze out of my time with it. But I got the sense that more than many modern metroidvanias, there were dangers lurking around the unseen corners. I was warned that if I had gone this way or that, I would've met a quick end--an approach that carries a refreshing old-school sensibility to the much more guided and safe metroidvanias that we've gotten accustomed to in modern games.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Atari hooks extend beyond the look and feel of the game, though. While Samsara retains its original plan for a sci-fi story that takes place on Pluto, the partnership with Atari has weaved in story hooks and Easter eggs from Adventure. I saw one such little treat during my brief time with it, by finding a dragon hidden among the Plutonian ruins. That combination gives the game an eerie, otherworldly feel, blending genres and continuities together within the isolated landscape. It's all a promising start for a game that, nearly 10 years ago, looked like it would never see the light of day.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>

                <p>It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades II</a> launched into early access, but today marks the game's third and last major content release before developer Supergiant Games diverts all attention to the rougelite's 1.0 launch.</p><p>The latest patch, called the Unseen Update, brings with it a host of changes and improvements, including balancing tweaks and combat improvements as has been synonymous with Supergiant's development process with its community. The update also includes some big content additions, including new aspects for all of its weapons, new optional dialogue and objectives for side characters, more powerful enemies in certain regions, and one special new song from the game's most popular band. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gv0eQjJ-gY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Gv0eQjJ-gY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps the biggest news was an update to the game's<a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> development roadmap</a>, which indicates that the Unseen Update is the last major content update before the game's official launch. Supergiant Games states that its next objective is completing the game's true ending, adding achievements for all platforms, and doing a final pass on all of the game's elements to polish it as best as possible for launch. Despite the announcement, the post stresses that there is still no firm release date for Hades II, with word on that coming at a later date.</p><p>"Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support," the post concluded.</p><p>Hades II has been feature-rich since its initial launch into early access and has been greatly expanded on with each of the game's three content updates. It now features a wealth of content you can play as you wait for the game's official release, with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">early-access review</a> noting that "Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel."</p>
