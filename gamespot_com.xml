                <p>The Borderlands series is well known for many things, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-co-op-aims-to-be-as-seamless-as-possible/1100-6533964/" data-ref-id="1100-6533964">emphasis on co-op</a>, unique visual style, and humor, but it is also quite famous for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">distinct player characters</a>, who often use advanced tech or psychic superpowers to lay waste to enemies. Harlowe, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>'s new playable characters, is no different, and Gearbox has finally provided some insight into how they play.</p><p>Harlowe has <em>a bunch </em>of toys at their disposal considering their past as a combat scientist for Maliwan, one of the Borderlands universe's weapons manufacturers. They seem to be particularly great at using this high-tech weaponry for crowd control, often debuffing or straight up incapacitating enemies to create advantages for themself and their team.</p><p>For example, one of Harlowe's main abilities is the Chroma Accelerator, which fires an unstable ball of energy that  drifts forward and plows through crowds, all the while dealing cryo damage to anyone it floats past. Harlowe players can also detonate it an anytime to deal radiation damage or seemingly wait for it to burst on impact. This skill can be further upgraded to bounce haphazardly between enemies, store damage overtime to be dealt when it eventually explodes, and it can even be given a greater gravitational pull.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrYNvTaFHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harlowe can also throw out a flux generator that emits an freezing energy field, and enemies that are caught in it are also entangled. This means that other enemies with the same debuff share weapon and skill damage dealt to them, like a chain effect. Additionally, it can gain a slew of new properties, including a greater radius, secondary area-of-effect triggers, and can even be used to simultaneously buff teammates and debuff enemies.</p><p>Harlowe's flashiest tool appears to be their Zero-Point ability, which suspends enemies in mid-air via a colorful, high-tech bubble. They can fire upon enemies trapped in them, but they can also press the action skill button again to slam these foes in whatever direction Harlowe is facing, which sounds like something I may never tire of. It can also be upgraded to provide healing to Harlowe or their teammates, attract ricocheting bullets to suspended enemies, or create a singularity and subsequent cryo explosion upon slamming an opponent in a bubble.</p><p>If you want to start planning your Harlowe builds, there is already a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/harlowe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preview of their skill trees</a> available, but you also won't have to wait too long to play the game for yourself. After all, Borderlands 4 is releasing on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 port coming about a month later on October 3.</p>

                <p>Later this month, Konami's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will bring a modern upgrade to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, a game over two decades old. And if the new remaster does well, it may not be the last time Konami revisits an older Metal Gear Solid game.</p><p>When asked about other potential MGS remakes, Delta producer Yuji Korekado told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/08/22/if-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-successful-its-producers-would-like" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, "At the moment, we are focused on delivering Delta in the best possible way to the current generation, and once this game is released, if the fans feel they would like to see more from playing the game, then we would like to consider lots of other games in the future. For now, this is it."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"We are always thinking about what we could do for the Metal Gear series," added producer Noriaki Okamura. "But in regards to remaking future titles, currently we're just focusing on the now, and we thought what would be the best way to reach both the old fans and potential new fans as well."</p><p>The most in-demand candidate for a remake may be Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, which has been locked in on PS3 for 17 years. Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 brought the original trilogy to consoles in 2023.</p><p>In a separate interview, Okamura and Korekado said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-era-of-metal-gear-solid-is-being-entrusted-to-a-new-generation-of-developers-if-its-made/1100-6534207/" data-ref-id="1100-6534207">they plan to hand the franchise over to a new generation of creators</a> if Konami decides to make a new Metal Gear Solid games. The creator of the franchise, Hideo Kojima, recently indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he won't play the new MGS Delta</a>. Okamura has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and vocalized his desire to work with him on the MGS franchise in the future.</p><p>Ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's August 28 launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, Konami revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/platinum-games-developed-metal-gear-delta-snake-eaters-secret-mode/1100-6534133/" data-ref-id="1100-6534133">Platinum Games worked on a new version of Snake's Nightmare</a>, a secret mode from the original game. Meanwhile, original Solid Snake voice actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-has-done-a-180-on-metal-gear-solid-5/1100-6533954/" data-ref-id="1100-6533954">David Hayter shared his thoughts about Metal Gear Solid 5</a>, which was the only primary game in the series he didn't lend his voice to.</p>

                <p>Team Cherry has finally, at long last, confirmed that Hollow Knight: Silksong is not only a real game, but that it will be available to play on September 4. That is soon. The game will be available to buy outright at launch, but will it also come to any subscription services, like Xbox Game Pass?</p><h3><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be on Game Pass.</strong></h3><p>Microsoft and Team Cherry have confirmed an Xbox Game Pass release for the highly anticipated game. It will be available via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so subscribers can play it across console and PC. Alternatively, people can get Silksong via PC Game Pass for PC-only access.</p><p>It's possible Silksong could come to the less-expensive Game Pass tiers, like Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Core, at some point down the road--but this is not confirmed. If it ever does, it likely wouldn't be soon.</p><p>2017's Hollow Knight is currently available on Xbox Game Pass, or it can be purchased for $15. Hollow Knight is also available via Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra Game Catalogue.</p><p>There is no indication that Silksong could launch into PlayStation Plus. If it ever comes to PlayStation Plus, it probably won't be anytime soon. Nintendo, meanwhile, generally doesn't do day-one new releases for Nintendo Switch Online for third-party games.</p><h3><strong>A long wait</strong></h3><p>Silksong was originally designed to be an expansion to Hollow Knight before developer Team Cherry built it out further and converted it to a full standalone game.
