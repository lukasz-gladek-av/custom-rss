                <p>PowerWash Simulator 2 will be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> at launch, Microsoft has confirmed. The company revealed this in the description of a video for the game's newest trailer, which focuses on mementos that players can place in their home after washing them off.</p><p>The first PowerWash Simulator, released in 2022, also came to Xbox Game Pass at launch. The game became an enormous success, so much so that developer FuturLab cited the commercial success as being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-game-prices-go-up-this-sequel-to-2022s-breakout-hit-will-not-cost-more/1100-6533948/" data-ref-id="1100-6533948">one of the reasons the sequel won't cost anything more despite adding a range of new features.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lhpv3-e9XI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lhpv3-e9XI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Outside of Game Pass, people can buy PowerWash Simulator 2 outright for $25. FuturLab said keeping the price at that level is meant to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-game-prices-go-up-this-sequel-to-2022s-breakout-hit-will-not-cost-more/1100-6533948/" data-ref-id="1100-6533948">acknowledge the current cost-of-living climate</a> and how people see PowerWash Simulator as "more than just a game" but also a "wellbeing tool."</p><p>Indeed, there is something zen and calming about cleaning things off with a high-powered water hose.</p><p>PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming this fall, but a specific release date has not been announced. It's coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p><p>In other Game Pass news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-gets-a-surprise-launch-today/1100-6534118/" data-ref-id="1100-6534118">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadowdropped on Game Pass today</a>, while some Gamescom announcements included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/high-on-life-2-delayed-to-february-2026/1100-6534115/" data-ref-id="1100-6534115">High on Life 2 for Game Pass in February 2026</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tropico-7-announced-at-gamescom-and-itll-arrive-at-launch-on-game-pass/1100-6534137/" data-ref-id="1100-6534137">Tropico 7 coming to Game Pass.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kalypso Media has unveiled Tropico 7 at Gamescom for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--as well as a day-one release on Game Pass. The city-building game is set to arrive in 2026, which would be seven years after the last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tropico-6-review-world-stage/1900-6417115/">Tropico 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again, Tropico 7 will see players taking on the role of El Presidente to oversee an island nation. What's new for this sequel includes a terraforming feature that means you can disappear mountains; a political affiliation system to select your type of dictatorship; and council negotiations with faction leaders. The last element is teased in the game's announcement trailer (seen below), in which El Prez sits with what looks like a military leader and hippie.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9ZrwBfbALU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V9ZrwBfbALU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There is a new developer for Tropico 7 with Kalypso's in-house Gaming Minds Studio, known for working on the Rail Empire and Port Royale franchises. For Tropico 6, Limbic Entertainment was the team behind the simulation title, but it was acquired by Bandai Namco a few years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics--giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love," said Gaming Minds studio and creative director Daniel Dumont in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Tropico 7 joins a handful of day-one Game Pass launches we've learned about this week, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/high-on-life-2-delayed-to-february-2026/1100-6534115/" data-ref-id="1100-6534115">High on Life 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moonlighter-2-releases-in-early-access-soon-including-game-pass-on-day-one/1100-6534081/" data-ref-id="1100-6534081">Moonlighter 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-meets-trains-in-this-kick-flipping-dystopia-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-2026/1100-6534074/" data-ref-id="1100-6534074">Denshattack</a>.

All three models are increasing by $50 on August 21, which bumps the PS5 Slim Digital from $450 to $500.</p><p>Released in May, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PS5 Slim Digital bundle already offered terrific value at its $400 promotional price. Based on current prices, the bundle is valued at $520. Even if you don't care about Call of Duty, you're still saving $50 versus buying the console on its own. Based on the new PS5 prices, the savings doubles to $100 just for the console. Black Ops 6 is just the cherry on top here.</p><p>PlayStation also released a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+This+PS5+Slim+Digital+Bundle+For+%24400+Before+It+Sells+Out&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A35&amp;fnarticle_id=6534138&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Agamespot%2Far%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%253A%252F%252Fdirect.playstation.com%252Fen-us%252Fbuy-consoles%252Fplaystation5-console-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bundle-model-group-slim&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases%2F1100-6534138%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">regular PS5 Slim version of this bundle</a> for $450, but it's no longer in stock at any retailers.
