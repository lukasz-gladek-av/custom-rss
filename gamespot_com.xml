This set is called Deluxe Pack ex, and it guarantees at least one rare card in every pack. However, unlike previous expansions, it will only be available for a limited time.</p><p>According to the official <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon website</a>, every Deluxe Pack ex pack will include "one card with a rarity of ♦♦♦♦ or higher from previous expansions, from Genetic Apex to Wisdom of Sea and Sky." Moreover, the expansion will introduce "parallel foil" cards that boast a special shine effect, as well as older cards with new artwork. You can take a look at some of the cards in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmdrQkRfUBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hmdrQkRfUBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As mentioned, unlike previous Pokemon TCG Pocket expansions, the Deluxe Pack ex set will only be available through October 29, giving you a month to take advantage of the improved rates and fill out your card collection.

<p>"Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself," he said. "She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights."</p><p>Pritchard, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-pritchard-a970a21aa/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to LinkedIn</a>, has been with Nintendo since June 2006 and serves as the company's executive vice president of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience. In the press release, she said she's "humbled" by the promotion and focused on Nintendo's legacy of "surprising and delighting" fans.</p><p>"I am humbled and excited to take on this new role," she said. "Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa thanked Bowser for his "numerous contributions" while saying he's confident that Pritchard will "continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles."</p><p>Pritchard will join NOA's Board of Directors and become an Executive Officer. Alongside Pritchard on the Board of Directors, senior Nintendo executive Satoru Shibata will also sit on the board as the chief executive officer while continuing to serve as the company's managing executive officer and corporate director.</p>

                <p>With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.</p><p>There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.</p><h2 id="When_does_Fortnitemares_2025_start_">When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?</h2><p>We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879"></a><figcaption>What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_collaborations_are_we_expecting_for_Fortnitemares_2025_">What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?</h2><p>It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The buzz is</a> that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1964043989398491543" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year</a>--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1965123026233819314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> R.E.P.O.</a>, though we don't know what exactly that will involve.</p><p>Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.</p><h2 id="Will_there_be_any_original_Fortnitemares_skins_">Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?</h2><p>It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year,<a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's looking like we're getting</a> a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065"></a><figcaption>Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Fortnitemares_2025_gameplay_changes">Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changes</h2><p>The start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.</p><p>So far, only two changes have leaked so far.

<section><p>RGG Studio continues its efforts to bring its beloved Yakuza series up to modern standards, and goes on step further for Yakuza 3.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I still can't believe this is really happening. Longtime Yakuza fans can finally delete all their sad tweet drafts after the recent Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, because Yakuza Kiwami 3 is real and, from what we've seen, it offers way more than anyone expected.</p><p dir="ltr">I played the original Yakuza 3 after Kiwami 1 and 2 because I wanted to experience the series in chronological order, but going back to a time when the series was less technically capable right after the two gorgeous Dragon Engine remakes ended up being a challenge. Yakuza 3 was released back in 2009, and the gameplay now feels considerably broken and outdated from a modern standpoint. The difficulty scaling in boss fights felt unfair and most of the time, I ended up intensely button mashing through battles, hoping to finally break blocks before getting annihilated with just a few hits. Outside of fighting the game felt slow and clunky. I wanted to enjoy Kiryu's downtime in Okinawa, but the dragged-out interactions almost ruined the experience for me, not to mention those early '00s face models when the gaming industry couldn't quite figure out what a child looks like.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, the game managed to save itself for me by having one of the most heartfelt stories in Kiryu's saga, with memorable characters that fans still gush about today. My experience may have been frustrating at times, but those rare, peaceful moments Kiryu spent with the orphans and his relationships with other Yakuza 3-exclusive characters are still some of my biggest highlights in the whole series.</p><p dir="ltr">Since my playthrough, I desperately wanted Yakuza 3 to be remade because I knew if the studio could just update the graphics and gameplay, it would easily end up one of my favorite titles. When I finally got to sit down and demo this remake, I'm not gonna lie, I teared up. Not only does Yakuza Kiwami 3 finally get the Dragon Engine treatment it deserves, but the added content proves once again that RGG puts a lot of love into its remakes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 Hands-on</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, our demo was short lived, but it gave me a glimpse of what changes to expect in Kiwami 3. We started with one of the opening moments of the game: Kiryu has removed himself from the Yakuza entirely and is now living in Okinawa with Haruka, taking care of orphans at Morning Glory, the orphanage where Kiryu grew up. However, constant eviction notices from the Ryudo family push Kiryu to the Ryudo Family office in the city, where he encounters Rikiya and Mikio, who've been spying on the orphanage. This takes us straight to the battle tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Since this is a remake, the game takes us back to its beat-'em-up roots with Kiryu's signature Dragon of Dojima fighting style but also features a new Ryukyu Style inspired by Okinawan martial arts. In the new fighting style, Kiryu is equipped with eight different weapons, each of which has a charged attack. The combat is largely similar to the previous Kiwami games, but it was fun testing out new weapons and combos with the Ryukyu style. Of course, nothing beats my favorite classic Kiryu power move: beating up every single enemy with a bicycle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After the battle sequence, we were free to roam the city for a few minutes, and it was nice to indulge in some nostalgia while walking the streets of an Okinawa that has been updated in the new engine. There wasn't much to explore in the demo except basic activities like karaoke and eating at different restaurants. I did, however, spend most of my time with the new cell phone customization. I love that Kiwami 3 kept Kiryu's "Razor" phone, and this time, you can add charms, jewels, and customize the background. I made his phone pink with jewels and a heart charm, which will add a nice touch when getting all those hilarious Revelations again.</p><p dir="ltr">One change in the remake I'm still on the fence about is Rikiya's new face. In the original Yakuza 3, Rikiya had more of a youthful, somewhat innocent visage that complemented his naive personality and Okinawan roots. His soft and more casual appearance compared to typical Yakuza characters was more fitting as an islander, but it's now been replaced with his new voice actor Sho Kasamatsu's face. It'll be odd to get used to his new look now that he resembles a rugged, attractive Japanese actor, but hopefully the playful (and painful) interactions between him and his "aniki" Kiryu will deliver the same emotions. I'm really looking forward to how they play out a certain hotel scene. After getting a glimpse of the remake, it was time to check out the biggest surprise from the studio: Yoshitaka Mine getting his own game called Dark Ties.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Ties Hands-on</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Finally, a Yakuza game where you play as an actual yakuza! On top of a full remake, Kiwami 3 also features an entirely separate game that focuses on the main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, and the events that lead up to Kiwami 3's plot. Comparable to the Majima Saga in Yakuza Kiwami 2, this is a separate story that is accessible in the main menu but it's an actual full-length game. I don't think anyone expected RGG to give a one-off villain from 15+ years ago his own entire playable story, but the studio continues to impress me with how consistently they are at putting out meaningful content and give lots of exposition and love to its fanbase's favorite characters.</p><p>In Dark Ties, Mine is a businessman who wants to grow connections in the Yakuza world. We got to watch one of the opening cutscenes, where Mine is having an existential crisis about where his life is headed after leaving his current business. After witnessing the loyalty of Tojo Clan members to their chairman and our boy Daigo Dojima, Mine decides he will do anything to connect with him. He then receives a tip from a private investigator about a yakuza recently released from prison who has connections: the arrogant, perverted antagonist from Yakuza 3, Tsuyoshi Kanda. The first thing I thought during the opening cutscene was, "Wow, Mine is so beautiful in this game." His face design is slightly different from Yakuza Isshin's, but Mine fans will definitely be spamming the timelines with fan edits, myself most likely included.</p><p>Shortly after the cutscene, we tested out Mine's fighting style in the battle tutorial. Mine's style is a unique blend of aerial and "shoot boxing" moves that can trigger his Dark Awakening. This mode is triggered by building up the shackled hearts below his health bar through combos and, when activated, makes Mine more powerful. I couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of calling his specialty "Dark Awakening." Mine is jokingly known for being a bit emo, so it only makes sense his moveset would have an edge to it.</p><p>After the battle tutorial, we were free to explore Kamurocho. Like all Yakuza protagonists, Mine also gets to participate in minigames such as golf, baseball, and gambling. I was so happy to hear Shido Nakamura's voice as Mine again, so obviously the first thing I did during the free-roam session was head straight to karaoke. I can't tell if RGG making all the protagonists VAs sing karaoke is a perk or a punishment for them, but damn did Mine sound beautiful singing Bakamitai, even if it was to a photo of Kanda. Sorry to disappoint the MineDai fans with this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg"></figure><p>We were left on a cliffhanger after Mine finally met with Kanda, but I cannot wait to see what additional content we will be getting in his story and how it leads up to Kiwami 3. Considering we are getting the full backstory of Mine's relationships with both Kanda and Daigo, it will be wild when we finally get to witness their conclusions in Kiwami 3. More importantly though, I am really looking forward to the Mine and Daigo shippers' reactions and memes when the games are finally out.Out of every title RGG has released in the last couple years, this is the one I'm most excited about.</p><p>Spending time with Kiryu in the orphanage and witnessing him in a more peaceful setting in that beautiful Dragon Engine is something I greatly look forward to, on top of all the silly side content and moments with my favorite Yakuza 3 characters. Normally, I don't care for video game remakes--it's very rare they offer anything different for me aside from updated graphics, but RGG continues to pump out beautiful, re-crafted titles with new content. We are getting closer to having remakes of the studio's full library, and while there are minor, sometimes-questionable changes, these Kiwami titles prove RGG cares about its fanbase and wants newcomers to have the best experience with Kiryu's full story.</p>
