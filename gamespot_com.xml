                <p>After working on every GTA title since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iii-10-year-anniversary-edition-r/1900-6347881/" data-ref-id="1900-6347881">Grand Theft Auto 3</a> in 2001, producer and game designer Leslie Benzies left Rockstar Games after the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. Over a decade later, Benzies is set to release his new game, MindsEye, later this year as seen during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a>. And if the new trailer is any indication, MindsEye is going to be an action game with some sci-fi touches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtfMjgFKG-w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NtfMjgFKG-w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>MindsEye puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, an ex-soldier who has a neural implant called The MindsEye placed in his head even after his military service has ended. The MindsEye is also giving Jacob visions of a covert mission he can't quite remember that may have changed his life for the worse. But as Jacob goes looking for answers, he finds himself beset by an unknown faction that's out to silence him with extreme prejudice.</p><p>As seen in the accompanying gameplay trailer below, MindsEye takes place from a third-person perspective, and GTA fans will probably be right at home as Jacob uses any means necessary to take out his foes. He can even get in cars and engage in shootouts from behind the wheel. Jacob also has a companion drone that he can use to scout enemy positions and give himself an edge in combat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoIAnnV9LI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WHoIAnnV9LI?start=6" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Benzies' company, Build A Rocket Boy, developed MindsEye, which will be published by IOI Partners. The game is set to hit PlayStation 5 this summer. For the rest of the State of Play reveals, check out the gallery below.</p>
