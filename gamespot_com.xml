                <p dir="ltr">As hard as this may be to believe, Avowed--the first-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment--has already been out for three months. Obsidian isn't resting on its laurels, however, as the studio has released a full roadmap for the rest of 2025 that includes some juicy additions to the open-world adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spring update, Update 1.4, released today on Xbox and PC. It adds improvements to the map's fog of war mechanics, an Arachnophobia Safe Mode for players who hate spiders, and support for a mouse and keyboard control scheme on Xbox, among other things. Today's patch also allows players to wait at the Party Camp to pass in-game time, view chests on the minimap, or perform a new cancel ability with Bow and Arquebus power attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798"></a><figcaption>Avowed Roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Summer patch will bring improvements to cooking and crafting, custom map markers, and new NPC abilities and behaviors throughout. The Fall update, meanwhile, will add New Game Plus, a Photo Mode, new character presets, and a new weapon type--though Obsidian's blog post on the roadmap doesn't go into specifics on what that new weapon type will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed launched in February to critical acclaim, as it currently sits at an 81 average score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>. It was first announced in July 2020, during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-showcase-event-every-game-shown-from/1100-6479333/">Xbox's summer showcase</a> just before the launch of the Xbox Series X|S the following November.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is available now for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

                <p>If you ever wondered what the Kentucky Derby would look like if attendees traded big hats for medieval garb, Bohemia Interactive has you covered. Today, the developer released Patch 1.3 for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which, among other big changes, brings horse racing to the game--along with a few new quests to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">The horse racing activity can be found in the Nomads' camp in the province of Trosky, and players can participate in either cross-country races or mounted archery competitions. Three new quests related to horse racing will also be added: Horses for Courses, Racing Horseshoes, and The Executioner's Edge.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH9pzsEsC4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AH9pzsEsC4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The patch also includes dozens of fixes across the entire game, including improved fast travel speed while riding a horse, a fix for a bug where Henry's trusty dog Mutt would at times randomly attack him, and more. The full patch notes for the 1.3 update can be found on the <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-1-3" rel="nofollow ">official KCD2 website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.3 launches alongside Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's first paid DLC story expansion, Brushes With Death. In it, Henry must help a mysterious painter character complete his life's work--and in the process, discover secrets from his past.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. PC. Brushes With Death is sold separately, and as part of both the KCD2 Expansion Pass and Gold Edition.</p>

Blizzard additionally used the update to introduce a major quality-of-life change, one that it initially forgot to include in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.2.1, released on May 14, added the ability to turn in Tree of Whisper bounties from any major city, with Ravens of the Tree now located in Cerrigar, Gea Kul, Ked Bardu, Kyovashad, Kurast, and Zarbinzet. It's actually a feature originally part of Season 7 that has now been added to the game permanently.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"This is a commonly requested feature from Season 7 that has been brought back into the game to help players save time on Whisper events," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said in a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/patch-221-raven-of-the-trees-now-found-in-each-major-town/222502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "This was originally missing from the patch notes, but we will be updating the notes to include this feature."</p><p dir="ltr">It might not sound like much, but being able to turn in Whisper bounties in major cities where players likely are already spending their time significantly speeds up the entire bounty running process. Instead of completing 10 bounties, having to navigate to the map, travel to the Tree of Whispers, turn in, and then teleport back to their previous location, players can simply travel to a nearby town and turn it in immediately, or wait for when they are already in town doing various other activities to do it then.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature has since been added to the official <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> with a comment from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">"We recognized that backtracking to the tree to turn in Whispers made for a bloated gameplay loop," the patch notes read. "A Raven of the Tree was added to each capital city to cut down on turn in time."</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes in the update, numerous Spiritborn skills and passives have received buffs, along with buffs for multiple Druid passives and some significant damage increases for Barbarian items like Ghor's Devastating Grips and Twin Strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been a few season-specific improvements as well.

                <p>It’s been three years since Sony launched its popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM5 Headphones</a>, and today it’s officially launched its successor--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6</a>.

Early reviews are incredibly positive, with critics pointing out the headphones impeccable noise-canceling skills and ultra-comfortable design.</p><div title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3524" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony WH-1000XM6 - Noise-Canceling Wireless Headphones</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$448 at Amazon | $450 at Best Buy</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony made two big upgrades with these new headphones. First and foremost is the new noise-cancelling processor. The QN3 is said to be seven times faster than the processor found in the XM5, resulting in enhanced active noise cancellation. Using 12 microphones, it can sense and react to noises in your environment, quickly adapting its performance to reduce ambient sound.</p><p>The other big addition is a folding design. Sony abandoned this with the XM5, and while the folding system isn’t identical to the older XM4, the end result is the same. Thanks to metal joints, you can swivel and fold the earcups, making them easy to transport in the included carrying case.</p></div>                      </div><p>You’ll get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, a wider headband for added support and comfort, and a six-microphone system that picks up and transmits crisp audio for phone calls. Of course, it also benefits from enhanced drivers, which should provide clearer audio for all your content. The headphones are available in black, midnight blue, and silver.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade your audio but don’t want to drop $450, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM4</a> headphones are currently on sale. The XM5 are $348 (was $400) and the XM4 are $298 (was $348). The XM5 offer superior noise-canceling chops compared to the XM4--but they lack the ability to fold, making them a bit more cumbersome for travel or storage. The XM4 are also on sale for $50 off, though audio quality and ANC aren’t quite up to par with the newer XM5.</p><p>The XM6 essentially combines the best aspects of both headphones while also improving overall performance. Be sure to give all three a look before deciding which is best for your needs. There are plenty of other great headphones available in 2025, and you’ll find a few of our favorites below. </p><h2>More Noise-Canceling Headphones</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM4</a> -- $298 (<del>$348</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> -- $348 (<del>$400</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max</a> -- $500 (<del>$549</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort</a> -- $349</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> -- $429</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ2TBSPV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sennheiser Momentum 4</a> -- $316 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4</a> -- $130 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> -- $170 (<del>$350</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Playing video games is getting more expensive these days, with companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Nintendo and Microsoft announcing plans to charge $80 for games</a>, and consumers are ready and willing to embrace the higher price points. That's according to analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that with Nintendo and Xbox announcing price hikes on games, "the floodgates are now open." He expects every publisher in video games that can raise prices to do so.</p><p>"The market will bear it. Plenty of gamers are willing to pay price points above $70, as shown by the high numbers of those willing to pay $100 for a few days' early access," Elliott said.</p><p>He added that, even in challenging economic times, people will spend money on what they want the most, including video games. "The rising prices won’t necessarily reduce spending. The market will bear it. Early adopters will always be early adopters," he said.</p><p>Before this, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said entertainment is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-not-worried-about-global-economic-turmoil-impacting-its-games/1100-6531397/" data-ref-id="1100-6531397">"fundamental human need,"</a> and as such, he's not worried about the global economic climate negatively impacting video games.</p><p>Newzoo's Manu Rosier, meanwhile, said rising game prices may lead to shifts in how money is spent, with consumers becoming potentially "more selective" with what they buy. A consumer may respond to rising individual game prices by "spending less on individual full-priced titles and more on subscriptions, discounted bundles, or long-tail live-service games," he said.</p><p>"The total spend may remain steady or even grow modestly, but the distribution across formats and platforms will likely continue to evolve. Xbox's pricing changes, and similar moves by others, could accelerate this transition toward services and ecosystems over standalone product purchases," Rosier said.</p><p>Game prices are not going up universally, as 2K Games just announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country will go for $50</a> when it launches in August. But history shows that there have always been lower-priced games in the market at the same time as higher-priced ones. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1921280736901882167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "$50 games in 2025 is just the new $40 games from the PS4 gen and $30 games from the PS2 gen. They've always existed and usually been the price point for titles that aren't quite AAA in nature."</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana added that he believes consumers may shift towards free-to-play games and other "more easily accessible forms of games."</p><p>"Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, etc. will likely see even more players and hours spent in their ecosystems. Players will also rely on and continue to play devices they already own a bit more rather than buy new hardware," he said. "And, as prices rise in everyday spending categories like food, gas, shelter, automotive, etc, there will be fewer and fewer dollars available for categories like gaming in the U.S."</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">first $80 game is Mario Kart World</a>, which is a launch title for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--so far, it's the only game that Nintendo has confirmed will carry that price point. As for Microsoft, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will start charging $80 for some games later this year</a>, but the company has not said which ones.</p><p>Beyond game prices going up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising Xbox prices</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">Sony might do the same</a>, in part due to the impact of tariffs.
