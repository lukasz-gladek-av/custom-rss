                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> will feature an overhauled loot system, bringing in new weapon manufacturers, increasing the weapon variety through a parts system, and readjusting loot's drops rates.</p><p dir="ltr">Shown in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY">PlayStation State of Play</a>, Borderlands 4 is making some big changes to the way guns work and the rates that loot drops at, in an effort to bring "the magic back" to the Borderlands loot grind. Borderlands 4 will feature eight weapon manufacturers, three of which--Order, Ripper, and Daedalus--are brand new. Each weapons manufacturer offers specialized weapons, usually excelling at some specific, like Jakobs weapons providing additional critical-hit damage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 Loot Manufacturers:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Jakobs - Critical hit friendly</li><li dir="ltr">Maliwan - Elemental focused</li><li dir="ltr">Vladof - Less accuracy, more bullets</li><li dir="ltr">Tediore - Toss to reload</li><li dir="ltr">Torgue - Explosive</li><li dir="ltr">Order - charge shots</li><li dir="ltr">Ripper - Fully automatic</li><li dir="ltr">Daedalus - Easy to use, multiple ammo types</li></ul><p>As detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation Blog</a>, Unlike the previous Borderlands games, the weapon manufacturers are going to overlap in Borderlands 4 as part of the Licensed Parts system. This system causes weapons to feature parts from different manufacturers, giving you multiple specialties on a single weapon. The example shown was a Vladof gun with a high ammo capacity using Torgue explosive bullets. It sounds like weapons will drop this way, as there was no mention of crafting or changing out parts on guns.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new guns, there are also three new equipment types in Borderlands 4. Ordnance is a new shared slot for grenades and heavy weapons. Heavy weapons now operate on a cooldown system instead of using ammo. Enhancements replace Artifacts and now focus on providing boosts to specific weapon manufacturers. Lastly are the Repkits, which can provide healing or buffs on a cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">Gearbox also discussed how it would be changing the loot drops in Borderlands 4 to make the loot chase more exciting. This primarily means reducing how frequently legendary weapons drop and improving their individual stats and unique abilities to make finding them feel more exciting. Loot will be instanced for each individual player in co-op in Borderlands 4, and to help out with the loot grind, you will be able to replay missions and boss fights for more loot drops.</p><p>Borderlands 4 recently had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">release date moved up</a> to September 12, when it will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

The trailer also highlighted the world of Kairos--a brand-new planet to the Borderlands universe--and how exploring it will focus less on being given quests, and more on finding them yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kairos, according to the video, is a secret world, hidden away for thousands of years by The Timekeeper, Borderlands 4's main villain. Its location was discovered thanks to the events of Borderlands 3, as the moon Lilith teleported away from Pandora broke the veil hiding Kairos and exposed it to the rest of the universe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562"></a><figcaption>The Digirunner in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The State Of Play showed one of the game's missions, set in a snowy mountain area called Terminus Range. New movement abilities were highlighted--including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point grappling, and a new vehicle called a Digirunner--as well as a dynamic weather system.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo then introduces a silo, which according to the video is "one of several new activities found throughout Borderlands 4." These activities will appear "naturally" as players explore the world of Kairos, without the need of being assigned the mission first--once you find one of these random events, it'll be added to your map and tracked on the HUD.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest in Gearbox Software's popular looter-shooter series, Borderlands 4 was first announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 last August. The first gameplay trailer then aired at The Game Awards 2024, where it was confirmed to launch in September of this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 will launch September 12 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It was originally set to launch on September 23, but 2K and Gearbox moved the date up earlier this week--and they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-insists-gta-6-is-not-reason-the-games-release-date-changed/1100-6531221/">swear it was not because of Grand Theft Auto VI</a>.</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://amzn.to/4jtAJL3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaming Week</a> runs through May 4, giving you a chance to pick up headsets, controllers, and video games at some of the lowest prices of the year. Several popular Capcom games are discounted in the event, including titles for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, so if you’re seeking an affordable game to keep you busy as summer approaches, it’s a great time to shop.</p><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024, and now you’ll find it for just $28 (was $36) on both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CP349RP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-XBX-Xbox-X/dp/B0CP34Z3DC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, which <strong>is the lowest price we’ve ever seen for Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong>. Like its predecessor that launched back in 2012, the open-world action RPG leans into the hands-off game design sensibilities of old school RPGs, which results in a true sense of exploration and tension. It also features stellar combat, which isn't surprising given Capcom's action game pedigree. It's worth checking out as a fun (and affordable) alternative to the newly released Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>A notable deal for Switch players is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Stories-Collection-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection</a>, which is available for just $28 (was $33.55).. This bundle includes the HD remaster of original Monster Hunter Stories and its sequel, Wings of Ruin, both of which off a unique take on the Monster Hunter universe. Unlike the mainline series' online multiplayer action RPG approach, the Monster Hunter Stories spin-offs are monster-taming RPGs where you track down and attempt to catch a variety of creatures, then team up with them in strategic turn-based battles.</p><p>Other great Capcom games discounted in Aamazon's sale include Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>) for $27 (was $50),  Dead Rising: Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D8M64LF3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-Xbox-X/dp/B0D8LVVVLC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>) for $27 (was $50), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-PS4-Xbox-X/dp/B0BJV1V458?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 4 (PS4)</a> for $20 ($30).
