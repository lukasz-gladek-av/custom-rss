That said, with dozens of ores available in the highly popular Roblox experience, it can be quite confusing where to find all of them.

Destroying these different types of rocks will give you the chance to obtain various ores and stones. There are a few additional gemstones and ores that can be found by defeating certain enemies as well.</p><p>With well over a dozen different ore for you to find in The Forge with varying locations and rarity types, it can be quite overwhelming.

The point is to take that ore to the titular forge and use it to craft various items. You are able to get weapons and armor by crafting with the ore at these forge locations in Stonewake’s Cross and the Forgotten Kingdom.</p><p>Of course, the rarer the ore, the better chances you’ll get a high-quality or even exclusive item. You can then take the items you have crafted using your ore and sell them or even equip them to have better stats to do better against the various enemies in the world. This is why it is vital that you know where to find specific ore, so you are always improving your gear and gaining even more money.</p><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge beyond the overwhelming number of available ores.
