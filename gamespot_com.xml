                <p>Microsoft's recent openness to bringing its biggest Xbox Series X|S games to PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">a boon for sales</a>. But the benefits for Xbox owners may not go both ways, as a trio of big upcoming Microsoft-published games are skipping physical releases on Xbox Series X|S. PS5 gamers, on the other hand, will be able to get physical editions of all three.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> are the three games in question, as seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCJY74BS,B0FCJHHYZY,B0FCJTVGKZ,B0FCJC4CQJ,B0FCJYV9DY,B0FCJFY734,B0FCHZ55LQ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. But it doesn't appear to be a case of Microsoft favoring PS5 over its own console. Instead, it seems to be part of Microsoft's broader push towards digital-only releases.</p><p>Instead of coming with a physical disc, The Other Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4 will only be packaged with a download code in Series X|S boxes. Strangely enough, Gears of War: Reloaded won't even have that physical option. It's strictly a digital release except on PS5.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that the majority of Xbox game sales are digital. Spencer also said that Microsoft was simply "following what the customers are doing." But the shift away from physical releases appears to be accelerating for Microsoft this year. That may be in part due to the uncertainty over whether the gaming industry will be seriously affected by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p><p>Of the three games, Gears of War: Reloaded will be released first on August 26 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Ninja Gaiden 4 and The Outer Worlds 2 will follow on all three platforms on October 20 and October 29, respectively. Brandon Adler, the game director of The Outer Worlds 2, recently shared his response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">Microsoft setting the price for that sequel at $80</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic Games surprised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> fans on Friday when it <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1933515577580024139" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that the next update, which was slated to introduce Season 9 of Fortnite Festival next Tuesday, has been delayed. Fortunately, the delay is about as short as it can get, as the patch has been pushed back just one day to Wednesday, June 18. Epic gave no reason for the delay.</p><p>The move is a surprising one, as it's rare for a patch to be delayed in advance by just a day. Normally, Epic doesn't openly discuss patch timing--it just deploys it when it's ready with half a day's notice. This patch gets a public acknowledgement of its delay because it comes with the new Festival season launch, which has been scheduled for June 17 for months. The delay means that the current Sabrina Carpenter pass <a href="https://x.com/FNFestStatus/status/1933516051834094022" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be extended</a> by one day.</p><p>Usually when a patch gets bumped from Tuesday to Wednesday it's because that week's Monday was a holiday--Epic doesn't deploy big updates when its employees aren't in the office. While June 16 is not a US holiday, there is one later in the week: Juneteenth, on Thursday. It could be that Epic is observing the holiday early instead of during the middle of the week.</p><p>While Season 9 of Fortnite Festival was long rumored to have Daft Punk as its headlining act, it's now looking as though the featured artist will actually be Deadmau5. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">the new superhero season</a> began in Battle Royale on June 7, the updated map included <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931444514658422923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadmau5 posters</a>, similar to the way Epic teased Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter ahead of their season launches. While it's not yet confirmed that Deadmau5 is headlining, he's by far the most plausible candidate right now.</p>

                <p>Amidst Xbox's multiplatform publishing strategy, Sony is reiterating its commitment to prioritizing the PlayStation 5. During a recent <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony business meeting</a> and "fireside chat," PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company is taking a "very measured, very deliberate approach" when it comes to deciding if and when a first-party title appears on other platforms like PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony has been porting many of its marquee titles to PC for years. Some of its more recent live-service titles, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> and the short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a>, released day-and-date on console and PC, while tentpole single-player games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> typically release on PS5 first and arrive at least a year later on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about the industry's move towards multiplatform titles and how Sony is looking to protect the "value" of the PS5 console, Hulst indicated that Sony isn't looking to change its current strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's important to realize that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that," Hulst said. "Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that Sony's first-party titles are meant to be a showcase for the PS5 hardware, and that the company wants players to "get the best experience" from these titles playing on PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're very thoughtful about how and if and how we bring these titles to other platforms," Hulst said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an approach that appears to be working, even as Microsoft doubles down on its multiplatform game strategy of releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">Xbox titles on PS5 with positive results</a>. When asked about Microsoft's strategy and whether or not it's a good thing, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino said he believed competition in the industry is good and creates innovation, but that Sony is "confident and committed to our current strategy."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to discussing how its approaching platform exclusivity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Sony reiterated its commitment to live-service titles</a>, with Hulst stating he doesn't believe Bungie's upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a> will suffer the same fate as Concord.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is shaking things up with its new strategy of launching its own games on rival platforms, and now Sony has reacted to Microsoft's latest moves. As part of an<a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> investor fireside chat</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was asked to respond to speculation from investors that Microsoft is "moving away from the console."</p><p>To be clear, Microsoft has made no announcements about moving away from building hardware, and in fact, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already said it's working on its next console</a>. In any event, Nishino responded by saying Microsoft trying something new and creating an additional competitive element in the gaming landscape by launching more of its games on rival systems is "healthy and pushes us to innovate."</p><p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall game industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said. "However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy, and there isn't an urgent need for us to pivot. We will continue to monitor play patterns and invest appropriately as required."</p><p>The next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-how-to-get-in-whats-in-it-start-times-and-more/1100-6532379/" data-ref-id="1100-6532379">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, which debuts in August, representing the first time the Gears franchise will be available outside of Xbox and PC. Microsoft recently launched Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation, and the company's biggest series, Call of Duty, is developed for both Xbox and PlayStation systems.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox platform is understood to be the lowest-selling of the main three when compared against Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch devices. Microsoft is no longer pushing Xbox hardware as much as it once was, as it's rolled out a new marketing campaign saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">you don't need to buy an Xbox</a> because many of the products you may already own can play Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles make money, but games and services are more lucrative. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream. Bringing Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo devices is another way Microsoft can make more money as well.</p><p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">time and again repeated his comments that Xbox is a business</a>, and his job is to grow that business, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">even if it means laying people off, closing studios, and cancelling games. </a></p><p>Also during the presentation, Sony management <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/" data-ref-id="1100-6532420">briefly discussed the PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-doesnt-sound-too-concerned-about-switch-2-even-after-a-record-breaking-debut/1100-6532425/" data-ref-id="1100-6532425">responded to the record-breaking launch of the Switch 2.</a> Sony also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-playstations-current-pc-port-strategy-to-change-anytime-soon/1100-6532428/" data-ref-id="1100-6532428">discussed its strategy for PC releases.</a></p>
