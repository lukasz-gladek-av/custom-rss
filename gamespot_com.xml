Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m74irgumzc2z" rel="nofollow ">On BlueSky</a>, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">the Nex Playground</a> at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74irgumzc2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia322nlfoz43oosiekrrqcbmwxxttuaf4ixdbpj5d5fj4t7oj3k4u" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

  </div><p dir="ltr">In fact, this isn't the first time Nex Playground has upped Sony's system in the US for a short time. In July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nex-playground-active-play-system-video-game-console-deal/1100-6527044/">the cubed console went on sale for Prime Day</a> and sold more units over the past month than any PS5 option on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Nex Playground relies on motion-based movement for players. In other words, this console is very similar to Xbox Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. Nex Playground comes with five titles installed, and owners can purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-console-bundle-is-discounted-for-cyber-monday/1100-6536599/">Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle is available for $50 off</a> at select retailers, though this deal wasn't available during the time period noted by Circana. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DGY63Z2H,B0FRSYZGBM,B0FRSZT2H5,B0FLYKJB68,B0CL61F39H,B0CL5KNB9M,B0FRGTYSL5,B0FRGMYJMG,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B0C1Q9X8VH,B0FP6H8BRZ&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">PS5 discounts </a>began around November 20 so would be included briefly for that week last month.</p>

                <p>Sega has decided that now's the time to join the myriad other companies in the games industry adopting artificial intelligence to streamline their development processes.</p><p>In response to a question about combating ballooning game development budgets, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">per VGC</a>, Sega executives said during a Q&amp;A session after the company's Q2 financial results presentation that it will use the most efficient development methods available. If that happens to be AI--which is becoming increasingly popular in the games industry as of late--then that's what Sega will use. It just won't be everywhere all of the time, apparently, but it will be there.</p><p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI," the company said. "However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully [assessing] appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p><p>Sega is the latest company to join the consortium of game publishers, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/">Activision</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/">Square Enix</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/">Krafton Inc</a>., all hopping on the AI bandwagon.
