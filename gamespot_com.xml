The collaboration will run between March 18-31.</p><p>There are new FEARLESS Legendary skins for Mercy, D.Va, Illari, Ashe, and Juno, as well as Blue Flame recolor skins for Kiriko, D.Va, Sombra, Tracer, and Brigitte.

In August 2024, Blizzard <a href="https://gamerant.com/overwatch-2-le-sserafim-skin-series-return-season-12/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brought back the popular skins</a>, allowing players to purchase a specific hero's bundle for 2,500 Overwatch Coins.

Konami has <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> a Silent Hill Transmission--the name it gives to its virtual showcases centered on the series--is coming this Thursday, March 13 at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET. The video will focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, the next mainline game in the series.</p><p>Silent Hill f was revealed in 2022, but we've not seen it since that day. That was when we saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/silent-hill-f-teaser-trailer/2300-6459798/">teaser trailer </a>debut alongside several other Silent Hill projects, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, which is still in development from No Code. Based on the wording of Konami's tweet, it doesn't seem like any other games will be mentioned during the showcase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456847"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f's flowery imagery is memorable, and soon it may be placed in a clearer context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4456847-4051647-shill.jfif.jpg"></figure><p>Last we'd heard, the oddly named Silent Hill f was in development from Neobards, a studio with experience supporting Resident Evil games, including the remakes for Resident Evil 2 and 3, as well as Resident Evil 7 and its multiplayer mode, ReVerse. The game's story will be penned by famed Japanese writer Ryukishi07, the author of the acclaimed When They Cry visual novel series.</p><p>Should the game be the next to debut in the Silent Hill series, this would make it the first new entry in the series since 2012. It would also be the first from a team based in Japan in more than two decades, the last of which Team Silent's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room/" data-ref-id="5000-20157">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> in 2004.</p><p>We've assembled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">everything we know so far about Silent Hill f</a>, including a theory regarding its strange title, so you can catch up while you wait for this week's Silent Hill Transmission.</p>
