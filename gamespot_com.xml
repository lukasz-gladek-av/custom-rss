As for the internet issue, players encountered issues blocking them from advancing past the "Searching for networks" prompt, but that's been fixed now with this new update. Finally, the new Switch 2 update includes "general system stability improvements" that Nintendo didn't provide any specific details about.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1944931712858771592" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Datamining expert Oatmealdome</a> found some additional improvements with the update, including problems with backwards compatibility for Switch 1 games.

                <p>Like most open-world games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will have its fair share of collectibles to hunt down. The catch here is that you'll need to really work to get your hands on collectible bobblehead replicas of everyone's refund-adverse arms dealer, Marcus, as these will be hidden away in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>As detailed by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, the idea for these collectibles came from the studio wanting to push the game's enhanced move-set to its very limits. Borderlands 4 has several new traversal options--including gliding, double-jumping, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/" data-ref-id="1100-6528427">and using a grapple-hook to move around areas</a>--and Gearbox wanted to reward players with a memento for reaching remote spots on the map.</p><p>"Graeme Timmons--Borderlands 4's creative director--got with some of our designers and other artists and engineers and decided that we needed something for players to find when they made their way to these remote or uninhabited areas," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944529531978858850" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>. "We wanted something of an icon. The same kind of thing in each spot, so players would <em>know</em> they found it. The item had to be simple, recognizable, have a feeling of being something one might collect--and ideally--having real connections to our universe."</p><p>This led to the Marcus bobblehead being chosen, and there's even an in-universe reason for these being on the isolationist planet of Kairos. As Pitchford noted, there are "well over 200" of these bobbleheads to collect, and he expects that most players will never see any of them. "A very, very small number of people will explore Kairos so completely that they might discover them all. Each has a story," Pitchford added, while also throwing down a gauntlet to players with the inclusion of a map showing off the locations of these collectibles.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944532238554812905" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">All in all, there are well over 200 Marcus Bobbleheads hidden around Kairos.
