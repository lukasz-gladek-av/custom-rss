                <p>Razer has unveiled the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05297ER3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 18 (2025)</a>, its most powerful gaming laptop to date. Like the recently announced Blade 16, the new 18-inch Razer laptop utilizes the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs. Both of Razer's new high-end gaming laptops are available to preorder now and expected to release on April 30. The Blade 18 starts at $3,200, while the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 16</a> retails for $2,800 and up.</p><hr><p>Preorders for the Blade 18 come with the Laptop Stand Chroma ($130 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($65 value). If you preorder the Blade 16, you'll get Razer's USB-C Dock ($120 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($60 value).</p><p>The Blade 18 has a unique dual-mode display that supports 3840 x 2400 UHD+ resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alternatively, the screen can render images at 1920 x 1200 FHD+ resolution with a blistering 480Hz refresh rate.</p><h2>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</h2><h3>Starting at $3,200</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg"></figure><p>With the option to customize the Razer Blade 18 with up to an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, it should be ready to handle anything you throw at it. The RTX 5070 Ti comes standard, while upgrading to the RTX 5080 costs an extra $500 and the RTX 5090 costs $1,300. All GPUs are paired to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (5.4GHz) yet the chassis remains slim at just 21.99mm thick. You’ll also get to pick your SSD size, ranging from 1TB to 4TB. The same goes for memory, with options for 32GB or 64GB models.</p><p>Beyond all the power, one of the most intriguing features of the Blade 18 is its new display. Razer says it’s the “world’s first” 18-inch dual-mode display, allowing you to run games with a UHD+ resolution of 3840x2400 and 240Hz refresh rate or FHD+ resolution of 1920x1200 and 440Hz refresh rate. That gives you the flexibility to choose whichever option is best for your current needs (resolution or speed), making the Blade suitable for all sorts of tasks.</p><p>Cooling the unit is a three-fan system that should quickly dissipate any accumulated heat, while the keyboard has been redesigned with new scissor switches featuring a 35% increase in travel distance compared to the outgoing model. There’s also a 10-key numpad and dual-LED backlighting per key.</p><p>Combined with a six-speaker THX system and a 5MP webcam, it’s clear Razer has built the Blade 18 to battle with the most premium gaming laptops on the market.</p><p>If you prefer AMD processors, the Razer Blade 16 comes with the new Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. You can pair AMD's high-end CPU with one of the RTX 50-Series graphics cards. The Blade 16 has a 1600p QHD+ OLED display capable of 240Hz refresh rates. You're missing out on the dual-mode display tech, but you're getting an OLED screen instead.

                <p>Prior to Marvel Rivals, casual superhero fans may have only been familiar with Moon Knight's live-action 2022 Disney+ series starring Oscar Isaac. The Fist of Khonshu first appeared in comics 50 years ago when he went up against Marvel's Werewolf by Night. However, some fans believe that Moon Knight has a grudge against Dracula because of a popular meme, and now even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> is getting in on the fun with some very amusing callbacks in the game.</p><p>The meme in question features artwork from one of Marvel's comics, but the dialogue was reedited to make Moon Knight angry at the lord of the vampires over an unpaid debt. This never happened in Marvel's comics, and Moon Knight hasn't had a lot of interactions with Dracula in-continuity.</p><p>Marvel Rivals continuity isn't bound by that technicality, and NetEase apparently added in a few Easter eggs for the meme in the new map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park, which debuted as part of mid-Season 1 update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">Dracula is one of the main villains of Season 1</a>, and Moon Knight was one of the first heroes in Marvel Rivals. They haven't crossed paths on-screen yet, but Moon Knight mentions the debt Dracula owes him in the clips below.</p><p>So far, the two specific lines of dialogue that came up for Moon Knight in this map are "Dracula's here? Good, that bloodsuckin' nerd owes me big" and that it's "time for Dracula to pay up." There's also another reference to it in Moon Knight's in-game lore tab. In the text where Moon Knight is conversing with his patron deity, Khonshu, he says that "[vampires] suck" and "Dracula owes me money."</p><p>This lighthearted touch is a welcome discovery after the news about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">NetEase laying off some of Marvel Rivals' developers</a> despite the game's massive success. A recent report even suggested that NetEase considered replacing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">Marvel's characters or canceling the game outright</a> to avoid paying Disney for the rights to use them in the game. Regardless of whether either option was ever a viable choice, Marvel Rivals has already established itself as one of NetEase's most popular titles in a very short time.</p>

                <p>BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has claimed that Xbox could've had another potential franchise hit in the RPG Jade Empire if it wasn't for Microsoft's short-sighted advice.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=526b6e50087f44ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said that Microsoft convinced BioWare to release Jade Empire at the tail-end of the original Xbox's lifecycle. "It was the worst advice; absolute moronic advice from them. The stupidest thing ever," he explained.</p><p>He claimed that Jade Empire should've been an Xbox 360 launch game, which would've made it more successful as a product at the beginning of the console's lifecycle as opposed to the end of the previous console's lifecycle.</p><p>Zeschuk explained that if he had pushed for more development time and money, Jade Empire could've joined the ranks of fabled franchises like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. "Give us six months; give us the chance to make it a launch title for the 360 and we'd have another franchise," he said.</p><p>Jade Empire launched on the original Xbox in April 2005, and the Xbox 360 was released in November 2005. The most recent <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/edmonton-journal/88437678/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimate of the game's sales</a> was back in July 2005, where it crossed 500K units sold, which was below expectations.</p><p>While Jade Empire is backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, there have been no subsequent entries outside of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jade-empire-special-edition-review/1900-6166271/" data-ref-id="1900-6166271">enhanced PC port in 2007</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/biowares-classic-action-rpg-jade-empire-hits-ios/1100-6444254/" data-ref-id="1100-6444254">iOS port in 2016</a>. Back in 2011, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-sequel-confirmed/1100-6139680/" data-ref-id="1100-6139680">expressed interest in creating more games</a> in the Jade Empire universe, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-2-stillborn-on-pc-ps3-and-xbox-360/1100-6308731/" data-ref-id="1100-6308731">any hopes of a sequel</a> were eventually dashed.</p>
