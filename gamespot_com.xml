                <p>It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">first device running an Arm chip</a>. But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary.</p><p>Valve's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">Steam Frame</a> headset is the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-steam-frame-will-support-android-games/1100-6536169/" data-ref-id="1100-6536169">first Arm-based device</a>, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared.

<p>"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts," Griffais explained. "We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since."</p><p>This is backed up by FEX's Ryan Houdek, who thanked Valve in a recent <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">anniversary post</a> for "being here from the start" on the seven-year project. "They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases."</p><p>While Valve has only just revealed its first Arm-based device, the company started thinking about developing for Arm as early as 2016. "We knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries," Griffais said.</p><p>As an open-source tool, FEX is already being used alongside other Valve-supported tech like Proton to power some of the leading PC emulators for Arm-based mobile devices--meaning Valve is quietly leading the push to bring Windows games to your phone without the need for a port. Whether the company has its own ambitions in the mobile space is yet to be seen, with Griffais saying Valve's current focus remains on "living room, handheld, and desktop."</p><p>Valve's support of emulation comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/" data-ref-id="1100-6536209">hard lessons learned</a> when its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine </a>flopped, partially due to its limited library. By investing in technology like Proton and FEX, Valve aims to save developers from having to put in time and resources on ports. "We would way rather have those game developers invest their time and energy into making their games better, or working on their next game," Griffais says. "We think that porting work is essentially wasted work when it comes to the value of the library."</p>

                <p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that the former alleges is a "slavish clone" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been "engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute." Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension.</p><p>The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.</p><p>At the heart of Sony's case is an accusation that Tencent intentionally tried to confuse players by passing Light of Motiram off as a Horizon-related game. Prior to the legal fireworks, Tencent apparently pitched Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">a Horizon game that was set in Asia</a>, which was ultimately turned down. Once the lawsuit was filed, Tencent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">pulled the Horizon-like imagery</a> from the game's Steam page. In court, Tencent claimed that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">get a monopoly on games similar to Horizon</a>.</p><p>Tencent also argued that it wasn't liable for any damages because any previous discussions about a Horizon game or even the development of Light of Motiram were done by subsidies owned or partially owned by Tencent. In response, Sony accused Tencent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accuses-tencent-of-playing-a-shell-game-to-avoid-liability-in-horizon-lawsuit/1100-6535487/" data-ref-id="1100-6535487">playing a legal shell game</a> to avoid the repercussions of infringing on its intellectual property.</p><p>As these legal maneuvers played out, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-steel-frontiers/" data-ref-id="5000-702414">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, which will be coming to mobile platforms and PC. However, it's rumored that Sony is planning its own Horizon MMORPG for PS5.</p>

                <p>Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December.

That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.</p><p>To demonstrate, this is what the NES port looks like:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P7CdqiHHPpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Nintendo was a good home console for its era, but it couldn't make the game look as good as it did in the arcade. This version also had better music and sound effects.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqMlLueMpew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dqMlLueMpew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to goofs, this isn't quite on the same level as <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-thrones-viewers-spot-starbucks-cup-episode-1207606/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the coffee cup that was left on set in Game of Thrones Season 8</a> or HBO Max's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/mad-men-hbo-max-4k-stream-roger-sterling-barf-tube-errors-1236439517/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent mix-up with Mad Men</a> which featured shots that included crew members who were supposed to be hidden. Netflix may not even bother to acknowledge or fix the Ghosts 'n Ghouls mix-up.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-and-dragons-stranger-things-welcome-to-the-hellfire-club/1100-6533505/" data-ref-id="1100-6533505">a Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Stranger Things TTRPG</a>.
