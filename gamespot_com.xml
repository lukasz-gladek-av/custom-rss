While we still don't know what the mystery button does, we now know what sound it will make when it's pressed.</p><p>In a brief clip shared on Nintendo Today, the C button--a mysterious input that sits below the home button and is simply labelled "C"--is shown to make a cute noise when pressed. The clip is followed by a reminder that the Switch 2 Direct is happening today (in some time zones), when we will presumably find out for sure what the new button does.</p><p>The sound in the video is a classic piece of quirky Nintendo sound design, with some comparing it to the distinctive Mii sound effects. The reveal has renewed speculation over the button's function, with the Mii comparison leading some fans to guess that the C could stand for "connect" or "community," and would enable social features for the console.</p><p>Another popular guess is that the C button is a capture button, and the sound in the video is Nintendo's take on a screenshot sound effect. Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-quietly-confirmed-the-switch-2s-c-button-in-nintendo-today-promo/1100-6530447/" data-ref-id="1100-6530447">compelling option</a> is "cursor," tying into ongoing rumors that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/" data-ref-id="2900-6247">will feature mouse functionality</a>, in which case the C button could be used to change input mode for the Joy-Cons.</p><p>The fact that Nintendo gave the button its own teaser only makes the mystery of the C button more intriguing, but it won't be long until we find out definitively what it does during the Switch 2 Direct, happening on Wednesday, April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

Back in January, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Switch 2 teaser trailer was released</a>, Nintendo confirmed the full reveal would be Wednesday, April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p><p dir="ltr">This Nintendo Direct will focus solely on the Nintendo Switch 2, though Nintendo has not confirmed any specific details that will be shown. Rumors and speculation expect new features--including the supposed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/">mouse functionality</a> of the console's Joy-Con controllers--as well as release date and price.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to watch the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DXUmjX7DsP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct will be available to stream on Nintendo's official </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nintendo">YouTube</a><span> (embedded above) and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a><span> channels. GameSpot's sister site Giant Bomb will also be reacting to the livestream as it happens on both the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamespot">GameSpot</a><span> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamespot">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamespot">Twitch</a><span>) and Giant Bomb (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/giantbomb">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/giantbomb">Twitch</a><span>) channels as well.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr">Nintendo Direct start time and runtime</h2><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Direct is scheduled to begin at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on Wednesday, April 2.

Aside from that, no official details have been presented for the console, but that is expected to change in a big way with this Switch 2 Direct.</p><p dir="ltr">With a new Nintendo console comes expectations for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">new entries in the company's many franchises</a>, and the already-confirmed Mario Kart and a new 3D Super Mario adventure in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey are among the most-rumored potential announcements. The term "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-may-have-given-away-a-clue-about-how-some-switch-2-games-will-work/1100-6530436/" data-ref-id="1100-6530436">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Game</a>" also surfaced after last week's Nintendo Direct, which could hint at upgraded versions of existing Nintendo Switch games--with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild chief among the rumored upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">From a third-party standpoint, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know-about-team-cherrys-metroidvania/1100-6520282/" data-ref-id="1100-6520282">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> continued its elusion of the news cycle with its absence from last Thursday's Nintendo Direct, which has led to speculation that it may appear in the Switch 2 presentation. Microsoft is also a common topic on the rumor mill after it delivered multiple games to the original Switch, though the company has not confirmed anything for Nintendo's new console yet.</p>
