                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> debuted earlier this year to critical acclaim, including praise for the performance of the voice cast. Charlie Cox--who is perhaps best known for playing the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Daredevil--lent his voice to the game as Gustave. Cox has previously shared that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-felt-like-a-total-fraud-after-the-game-became-a-massive-success/1100-6532618/" data-ref-id="1100-6532618">he isn't a gamer</a>, and he still hasn't played the game. But it sounds like he's ready to change that.</p><p>During a recent appearance at Galaxy Con (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-cox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-actor-1851786701" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>), Cox noted that the last game he played was Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 nearly three decades ago. But after hearing so much praise for Expedition 33, Cox wants to experience it for himself.</p><p>"I want to play the game," said Cox. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game ... I'm so happy for these guys because they're not like a big company that makes a ton of games. And I hear it's a frontrunner to win Game of the Year or something. It's really cool."</p><p>Until recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-is-no-longer-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/1100-6532565/" data-ref-id="1100-6532565">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the best-rated game of 2025</a>. It was only outdone by the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Regardless, industry figures-- <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-expedition-33-is-ideal-for-this-one-reason/1100-6532484/" data-ref-id="1100-6532484">including Hideo Kojima</a>--have had nothing but good things to say about Expedition 33.</p><p>The game's developer, Sandfall Interactive, has shared a message for fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-exploring-more-localization-options-new-content/1100-6532452/" data-ref-id="1100-6532452">about potential future updates</a> and which features may be added to Expedition 33. Sandfall is also actively working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/">on its next game</a>, which will not be a sequel to Expedition 33.</p>
