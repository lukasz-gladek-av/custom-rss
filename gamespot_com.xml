                <p>What does a day in the life of billionaire gaming boss Gabe Newell look like? Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">Zalkar Saliev</a> from one of his yachts, the Valve co-founder said he enjoys the benefit of living on a boat while maintaining a fairly regular work schedule.</p><p>"I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, work some more, [then] either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. I live on a boat so I just hang out with everybody on the boat. Then I work," he said, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> confirmed with Valve that this interview is real. "I work seven days a week: I'm working from my bedroom as you can tell. I like working, it's fun, to me it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super-awesome."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbvWCKMpSHQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qbvWCKMpSHQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Newell said the traditional idea of retirement is that you "stop doing your horrible job and go do what is most fun and entertaining," and in that sense, he said he feels like he's been retired for a while.</p><p>"I've said it before but, when you retire, you want to like stop doing your horrible job and go do what is sort of most fun and entertaining," says Newell. "In that sense I've been retired for a long time.</p><p>In addition to his responsibilities at Valve, Newell started the neural interface company Starfish Neuroscience, a competitor to Elon Musk's Neuralink. He's also working with a company that is creating an "aerosol pathogen detection device" that reveals what pathogens may be in the air.</p><p>"I just work all the time," he said. "But it's not like, 'Oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like, 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun,' you know?"</p><p>Newell dropped out of Harvard in the early '80s to join Microsoft, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-millionaires-unleashed-12-ex-194415077.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaving the company as a millionaire</a> with Mike Harrington to form Valve. He's now a billionaire, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/gabe-newell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes estimating his net worth at $9.5 billion.</a> Despite his immense riches, he still gets out there and talks to fans, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gabe-newell-personally-hand-deliver-steam-decks/1100-6501106/" data-ref-id="1100-6501106">he personally delivered Steam Decks back in 2022.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The current gaming industry is filled with remakes and remasters; some of them are faithful to their source material, while others are more open to changing things around when needed. It's not too often that the original creator of a remade work speaks about a modern reimagining, but recently the co-creator of Crash Bandicoot took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_in-my-opinion-key-word-opinion-the-crash-activity-7350944750100762624-wc29/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADS31r4B5UCbzMu8ZKusxOGCydRRQic55jc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> to give his thoughts on 2017's N. Sane Trilogy--and the "most important 30 milliseconds" worth of change that made a world of difference.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/crash-bandicoot/crash-bandicoot-co-creator-says-the-remake-got-almost-everything-right-except-the-most-important-30-milliseconds-and-thats-why-it-feels-worse-than-the-1996-original/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, Naughty Dog co-founder Andrew Gavin posted a wide range of thoughts about the modern remasters of Crash Bandicoot 1-3, While he says the games "nailed the visuals" and said they "looked great [and] faithful to the original," in his mind, things went south when it came to jumping--or, as he put it, the team "completely botched how jumping works."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892"></a><figcaption>That polar bear is just happy to see Crash, right?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The original game, Gavin explains, read how long the player held the jump button down and measured Crash's jump accordingly--the longer a player held the button, the higher Crash jumped. This mechanic was lost in the N. Sane Trilogy, according to Gavin, and replaced with a system when every jump is always the maximum height possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"The remake developers either didn't notice this system or thought it wasn't important," Gavin's post said. "They reverted to simple fixed jumps, [and] then realized Crash couldn't make half the jumps in the game. Their solution was to make all jumps maximum height."</p><p dir="ltr">This solution, according to Gavin, fundamentally changed how jumping in the remaster worked, to the game's detriment. "Now every jump on the remake is huge and floaty. Those precise little hops between platforms are awkward," Gavin wrote. "The game's fundamental jumping mechanic feels worse than the 1996 original despite running on hardware that's 1000x more powerful."</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to try the altered jumping for yourself, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is available now for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
