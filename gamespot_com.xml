                <p>Ghost of Yotei has a unique feature that allows players to press a button to travel back in time to see what main character Atsu was doing many years prior. This is available at specific places in the game world, but the original plan at Sucker Punch was to allow players to do this anywhere, any time.</p><p>Creative director Jason Connell said in a conversation with Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan that this feature was something he was "very excited about" when it was originally pitched years ago. He said the appeal was that players could be at one moment experiencing Atsu's story in the main timeline when things are dark and bleak and she's on her lone wolf quest, and the next they could travel back in time and feel the "warmth of her past" and understand what she's fighting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJWi6Pagmw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1552">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKJWi6Pagmw?start=1552" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It started off as, 'Let's do that as many places we can, maybe everywhere,'" Connell said. "Like, can we do this as like a, like a stake-in-the-ground game feature?"</p><p>However, after about a year of working on this, and with the understanding that it would require double the art, Sucker Punch had to scale it back and only have this feature available in certain areas of the game. "So while it's this amazing feature, it saddened me the day that I had to to kill that and narrow it. But in the end, it was the right choice," he said.</p><p>Connell said the decision to narrow the feature came after feedback from testers and in discussions with colleagues. While Connell said he feels confident it was the right call, it was still "hard" for him.</p><p>He added that, had the feature been available across the entirety of the game, it ran the risk of feeling like a "gimmick" if Sucker Punch couldn't back it up with enough "meat" to make it worthwhile, narratively speaking.</p><p>Gilligan, for his part, said the situation could be like the delicate balance of salt on french fries.</p><p>"It's like salt on your french fries. There's nothing better than just the right amount of salt on your french fries. And then when you overdo it, you're like, 'Ugh, these are too damn salty,'" he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a> praised the game overall, and specifically the time-travel mechanic. "By visiting her home and specific locations around Ezo, you can step into the past and revisit fond memories from her childhood, such as practicing sword fighting with her brother and working with her weaponsmith father in the family's forge," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p><p>"These windows into the past create further empathy for a character who eventually goes on to inflict brutal violence. You can feel the weight of her loss in each moment, and this persists throughout the game as you explore more and more of Ezo."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched in early October and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">exceeded 3 million sales so far.</a></p>

Each plushie--SpongeBob, Patrick, Plankton, and Sandy--has a cubic shape that will make them easier for the claw to grasp, and there are also six plastic prize capsule toys included here. Arcade1Up says the machine will offer three distinct modes of play, ranging from Easy Mode for kids or beginners to Normal Mode for a balanced challenge. Or if you feel like a dose of reality, Scam Mode will put your skills to the test.</p><p>The cabinet also features a light-up marquee, glowing control buttons, and an internal ceiling light alongside various images of SpongeBob and the main cast of the long-running cartoon series. The full cabinet measures over five feet tall, so you'll want to make certain you have some space at home for it.</p></div>                      </div><p>This isn't the first time that Arcade1Up has produced a claw machine, and if you'd like one that doesn't feature SpongeBob gleefully staring at you, you can grab a unit for $550 through Amazon. While you don't get any plushie toys included with it, it does have a more retro-inspired design, and it comes with 12 plastic capsules that you can add prizes to. Like the SpongeBob machine, you can set it to Easy, Normal, or Scam modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769"></a><figcaption>Arcade1Up Claw Machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg"></figure><p>SpongeBob fans looking to revisit Bikini Bottom can also preorder <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKVQ3PR3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a> ahead of its release on November 18 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and PC.
