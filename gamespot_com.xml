                <p>Fanatical just launched a new Fall 2025 Edition of its recurring <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Up+To+15+PC+Shooter+Games+For+Under+%2418+At+Fanatical&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-29+11%3A14%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-29+11%3A14%3A10&amp;fnarticle_id=6535743&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-shooter-video-game-bundle-october-2025%2F1100-6535743%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal, and this latest version features a refreshed list of PC games from various shooter subgenres, including first-person shooters, immersive sims, twin-stick shooters, and more. Like Fanatical's other build-your-own-bundle deals, pricing scales with how many games you pick, starting at $4.95 ($1.65 per Steam key) for the base bundle. At five or more games, the price drops to $1.60 per key, and if you pick seven or more games, you'll pay just $1.45 per key. There's no limit to how many games you can select, and if you grab all the items on offer, you'll pay just $17.50--that's a massive discount compared to the whole bundle's $200 value.</p><p>While there are 12 items you can add to your bundle, there are technically 15 games on offer thanks to the Boomer Shooter Quad Pack, which includes four games: Night Jackal: Blood Debt, Reaper, Flash of Blade X, and DOSMan: Space Aliens in Space. If you're only picking a few games from the bundle, this Quad Pack offers the best value.</p><p>One of our favorite games you can add to your bundle is Hyper Demon. This game features unique visuals delivered through 360-degree spherical projection, keeping the entire battlefield on-screen. Despite the mind-bending field of view, the game is a fast-paced blast to play thanks to its simple controls, fun arsenal of varied weapons, and dynamically scaling action that adapts to your skill level.</p><p>The bundle is stacked with great first-person shooters, but there are also several options for those who are looking for experiences outside the popular boomer shooter fare, including the horror-tinged adventure Pathologic 2, the excellent sci-fi immersive sims Prey (2017) and Zero Protocol, and the Western-themed sandbox shooter Chambers: The Outlaw. There are several more games on offer in Fanatical's Build Your Own Shooter Bundle Fall 2025 Edition, and you can check out the full list below. All games purchased in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys.</p><h2>Fanatical Build Your Own Shooter Bundle (Fall 2025)</h2><ul><li>Ash and Adam's Gobsmacked</li><li>Boomer Shooter Quad Pack (includes Night Jackal: Blood Debt, Reaper, Flash of Blade X, and DOSMan)</li><li>Chambers: The Outlaw</li><li>Defender Bros</li><li>Heretic's Fork</li><li>Hyper Demon</li><li>Neckbreak</li><li>OTXO</li><li>Pathologic 2</li><li>Prey (2017)</li><li>TombStar</li><li>Zero Protocol</li></ul><p>For more Fanatical bundle deals, there are some tempting offers to check out right now. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Up+To+15+PC+Shooter+Games+For+Under+%2418+At+Fanatical&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-29+11%3A14%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-29+11%3A14%3A10&amp;fnarticle_id=6535743&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fstar-wars-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-shooter-video-game-bundle-october-2025%2F1100-6535743%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Star Wars Collection</a> brings together several of the best games from that franchise, including Republic Commando, The Force Unleashed, and Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast.

                <p>Another major outage has hit the internet, as Microsoft Azure is experiencing issues. The company confirmed that its cloud computing service had begun to experience issues earlier today, and this has had an impact on several Microsoft services and the Xbox network across the globe.</p><p>This has also led to issues with the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, as developer Obsidian Entertainment has acknowledged that Xbox users "may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install" the game on PC or console. Xbox Game Pass has also been affected, and Obsidian says that it is working with Microsoft to resolve the problems.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid/app.bsky.feed.post/3m4dx2pwsik2j" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicr3duvbzz5gnkk4vdkie5rpgevv3ir7gcsqk5w56hzet7ububbyy" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, The Outer Worlds 2 may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>  — Obsidian (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@obsidian.net</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid/post/3m4dx2pwsik2j?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">October 29, 2025 at 7:13 PM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door (AFD) issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services," <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft said on its status page</a>. "We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue."</p><p>Microsoft said that it's currently taking several actions, including blocking all changes to the AFD services and rolling back AFD configuration to its last known good state. "As we rollback we want to ensure that the problematic configuration doesn't re-initiate upon recovery," the company explained.</p><p>Microsoft is currently investigating the outage, but it doesn't have an ETA for when it will be resolved. Last week also saw numerous gaming services affected when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-amazon-web-outage-knocks-fortnite-and-roblox-offline/1100-6535548/">AWS went down</a> and impacted several major services across the web, including popular games like Fortnite and Roblox.</p><p>In the case of Microsoft, the outage is also hitting several businesses as users report that major websites are failing to load. This is also bad timing for Microsoft, as the company is due to give a presentation on its earnings results later today.</p>
