                <p>Over the last couple of years, developer Insomniac Games has earned critical acclaim for its work on Marvel's Spider-Man series. Following two main Spider-Man games and the Miles Morales game, the studio's next project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight.</p><p>The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and while the game is still deep in development, a few new details about Marvel's Wolverine have been revealed recently.</p><h2 id="When_will_Marvel_s_Wolverine_be_released_">When will Marvel's Wolverine be released?</h2><p>As revealed during the September 2025 State of Play, Marvel's Wolverine will be popping its claws in Fall 2026. </p><p>Insomniac is something of a miracle worker when it comes to video game releases, as since 2018, the studio has shipped Marvel's Spider-Man, expansive DLC for the game, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, with Spider-Man 2 launching in October 2023. Insomniac has a reputation for surprisingly short development cycles in the current era of multi-year game projects, and it has been suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/">Marvel's Wolverine could launch in Fall 2024</a>. That didn't happen, of course, and most recently, Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-dev-refuses-to-comment-on-2025-release-date-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement/1100-6528944/" data-ref-id="1100-6528944">refused to comment when asked if Wolverine is coming in 2025.</a></p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_platforms">Marvel's Wolverine platforms</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Marvel's Wolverine will be headed to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive, given Insomniac's position as a PlayStation first-party studio<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-sony-bought-insomniac-games-we-felt-that-this-/1100-6469237/" data-ref-id="1100-6469237"> since its acquisition by Sony in 2019</a>. It's highly likely that the game will eventually come to PC, as several other Insomniac-developed titles have also wound up on that platform following their PS5 release.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_gameplay">Marvel's Wolverine gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQXgLjwdM98" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQXgLjwdM98" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wolverine isn't the kind of hero who wins a fight with quips and hugs, and naturally, Insomniac wants to create an experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-trailer-reveals-2026-release-window-and-very-bloody-gameplay/1100-6532076/" data-ref-id="1100-6532076">that feels fast and ferocious</a>. The studio says its aiming to create "the ultimate Wolverine fantasy" and enhance that vicious combat with action-packed set pieces and a gripping story. The first gameplay trailer hinted at this savage side of Wolverine, as the X-Man was using his adamantium claws to impale enemies, rip them apart, and brutally dismember them.</p><p>As for the tone of the game, Insomniac is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-will-be-full-sized-and-mature-in-tone/1100-6496210/">deliver a mature experience</a>, which is fitting considering Wolverine's nature as a walking weapon. Insomniac's recent games have also been showcases of slick action, so there's a good chance that the studio will deliver some cutting-edge gameplay with Wolverine that's balanced by the developer's ability to dig deep into the emotional core of its characters.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_story">Marvel's Wolverine story</h2><p>Insomniac isn't sharing too many details on what the storyline for Marvel's Wolverine will be, but the studio did tease that it will be original take on the character to uncover the secrets of a dark past that has eluded him. </p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_actor">Marvel's Wolverine actor</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cSbKIwGWQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P6cSbKIwGWQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To bring Logan to life, Insomniac recruited Australian actor Liam McIntyre to voice the character and provide motion capture for him. McIntyre has a long list of acting credits, and he's best known for playing the lead role of Spartacus in the TV series Spartacus: Vengeance. He also has extensive voice-acting experience, having voiced characters like Captain Boomerang and Aquaman in several DC animated films.</p><p>"Fans out there know what Wolverine is, who he is," McIntyre said in a dev diary video. "My job is to try to find the essence of who Wolverine is--especially as to how it applies to our story. People hurt him, people take from him, people betray him, [but] he still fights for people who can't fight for themselves."</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_cameos">Marvel's Wolverine cameos</h2><p>It wouldn't be a Marvel game without a few familiar faces, and Marvel's Wolverine has at least two recognizable ones: The treacherous shape-shifting mutant Mystique and one of Logan's deadliest enemies, Omega Red. Logan will also be going up against the Reavers, an army of criminal cyborgs who have menaced him and the X-Men for decades in the comics, and the trailer hinted at a fight with a Kaiju-sized Sentinel, the infamous mutant-hunting robots.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_screenshots">Marvel's Wolverine screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574751"></a><figcaption>Marvel's Wolverine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574752,1300-4574753,1300-4574754,1300-4574755,1300-4574756,1300-4574757,1300-4574758,1300-4574759,1300-4574760,1300-4574761,1300-4574762,1300-4574763" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg"></figure>

                <p>More PlayStation classics are coming to PlayStation Plus Premium before the end of the year, with Sony announcing a pair of well-loved fighting game threequels and a remake of a beloved action-adventure game are all joining the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/soulcalibur-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-23700">Soul Calibur 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-3/" data-ref-id="5000-2051">Tekken 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-anniversary/" data-ref-id="5000-27395">Tomb Raider: Anniversary</a> will be playable for PS Plus Premium subscribers, the service's most expensive tier, later this year.
