                <p>Retro gaming fans might have to make a difficult choice soon, as ModRetro has revealed that its modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console will cost $200. First teased last year, this could make it a viable alternative to the Analogue 3D, which costs $250.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palmerluckey/status/1948186521737302455" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>ModRetro's newest product is M64. The best and most authentic way to play your favorite N64 games, bar none. Prepare your wallet and brace your mind.</p><p>Launches at the same price as the original Nintendo 64. Inflation isn't nostalgic. <a href="https://t.co/LYDyiBBx2O" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LYDyiBBx2O</a></p></div>  â€” Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1948186521737302455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-3d-delayed-to-late-august-due-to-tariffs/1100-6533190/" data-ref-id="1100-6533190">Like the Analogue 3D</a>, the M64 is also an FPGA console that aims to replicate the experience of using an N64 at a hardware level. This is the same direction that ModRetro took for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/" data-ref-id="1100-6528473">ModRetro Chromatic</a>, a well-designed Game Boy successor that combines several modern conveniences with an authentic handheld gaming experience that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges. The handheld also feels great to use, thanks to all of the premium materials incorporated into its design.</p><p>Beyond that, ModRetro hasn't revealed any other details regarding the M64. The teaser trailer posted by company founder Palmer Luckey does have a very blurry tease of the device--and a "do not open until Christmas" message--and it looks like it'll sport a grey color scheme. The video also suggests that you'll be able to use your original N64 cartridges, and it'll be interesting to see if it has any of the other modern features built into the Chromatic, like native video streaming and multiplayer support.</p><p>FPGA consoles like this are generally seen as the best option for enthusiasts, due to them being able to play these games in HD via HDMI on a modern television. The Analogue 3D can do this in 4K, and it offers a variety of filters to make the experience look like you're playing on a CRT TV, so it'll be interesting to see if the M64 can offer a similar experience.</p><p>If you're a bigger fan of Nintendo's handheld gaming age, you can order the ModRetro Chromatic right now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/" data-ref-id="1100-6533058">as new stock has arrived</a> and it's also available in several new colors.</p>
