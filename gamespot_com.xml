                <p dir="ltr">The game that kicked off the long-running Legend of Heroes RPG series is getting a remake with Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which launches on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 25. The game is an all-new version of the original Trails in the Sky, remaking the PS3 and PS Vita game with full 3D high-res visuals, new voice acting, and overhauled gameplay. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series wanting to revisit the classic entry in a new way, or are looking to experience it for the first time, you can preorder physical copies now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2B89MSC,B0F2B8XZ17&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/y7q0lp7jm2a8y?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17444118258707?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Bonuses</h2><p dir="ltr">No preorder bonuses have been announced for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter. We'll update this section if anything is revealed ahead of launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. It will return players to where the long-running Trails series began. The game follows adoptive siblings Joshua and Estelle Bright, who join the Bracers peacekeeping organization. They're soon caught up in an international conspiracy and must join forces with various other characters to thwart a deadly coup. While it will maintain the same plot as the PS3 version, it uses the same engine as the latest entry in the series, Trails Through Daybreak, and will feature an all-new English voice acting class. There will also be a long list of gameplay changes, the most notable being the inclusion of two battle systems--one is a revised version of the original version's turn-based combat, and the other is a real-time system, and you'll be able to swap between on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering there are now 15 mainline games in the Trails series, giving new players a modernized way to experience the original as a jumping-on-point is a welcome decision. However, if you are looking to dive into the series now, your best option is to check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Heroes-Trails-through-Daybreak-PlayStation/dp/B0CK5664H5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trails Through Daybreak</a> sub-series, which marked the beginning of a new story arc in the sprawling series, making it another good starting point for newcomers. Its first sequel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Heroes-Trails-through-Daybreak-PlayStation/dp/B0D94WP3RF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trails from Daybreak II</a>, also launched earlier in 2025, and the third game in the arc, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trails-beyond-the-horizon-deluxe-and-collectors-edition-preorders-available-now/1100-6530828/" data-ref-id="1100-6530828">Trails of Beyond The Horizon</a>, is also coming to PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC this Fall. It doesn't have a specific release date yet, but preorders are already available, including a cool Deluxe Edition that includes a mini artbook and digital soundtrack for $60.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/woot-spring-gaming-sale-save-on-controllers-headsets-and-other-gaming-hardware/2900-6462/">Woot Spring Gaming Sale - Save On Controllers, Headsets, And Other Gaming Hardware</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-console-bundle-deals-still-available-at-amazon/1100-6529417/">Astro Bot PS5 Console Bundle Deals Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-steelbook-and-exclusive-crafting-table-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6530625/">Minecraft Movie Steelbook And Exclusive Crafting Table Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-causing-microsd-express-cards-to-sell-out-heres-where-to-get-one/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Is Causing MicroSD Express Cards To Sell Out - Here's Where To Get One</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-four-mario-kart-lego-sets-for-the-best-prices-yet-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Grab Four Mario Kart Lego Sets For The Best Prices Yet At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
