                <p dir="ltr">The revival of NCAA Basketball from EA Sports aims to feature "all 350 programs" for the sport. At least, that's what EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he'd love to see when talking on a quarterly earnings call earlier this week.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, Wilson was asked about the company's recent announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">a new college basketball game after 16 years since the last one</a>. Like the reveal, Wilson stayed relatively vague with details, though he noted his desire to include every university. "Weâ€™d love to do the same for basketball [as the company does with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football</a>]. All 350 programs, men's and women's teams, the iconic traditions and rivalries, and of course, March Madness," Wilson said.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no set date for when EA's college basketball is set to release, though 2028 was mentioned in <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/memo-ea-sports-looks-to-bring-back-college-basketball-video-games-starting-in-2028-2029-0ef3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a memo obtained by Extra Points</a>. The last game in the series was 2009's NCAA Basketball 10. The sports franchise began in 1998 with NCAA March Madness 98 and only was known as NCAA Basketball for the last two installments.</p><p dir="ltr">There very likely could be competition with EA's return to college basketball, unlike there is for EA Sports College Football. 2K Sports is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-sports-reportedly-planning-college-hoops-standalone-game-not-tied-to-nba-2k/1100-6533301/">reportedly working on a standalone college hoops game</a>, too. However, the return of 2K's College Hoops franchise is apparently aiming to include only 100 programs (men's and women's).</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-we-know-about-eas-first-new-college-basketball-game-in-a-long-time/1100-6533219/">everything we know about EA's new college basketball game</a>.</p>

<p>"And really, the big reason for that is this isn't just a product. We're really building out Battlefield as a platform. All will become more clear about the nature of our investment over the last four years, with four studios building against this launch to date," he added.</p><p>The four studios Wilson is talking about are DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect, all of which are working together under the Battlefield Studios banner to build the future of Battlefield.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-reveal-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6533413/" data-ref-id="1100-6533413">next big reveal for Battlefield 6 is coming up on July 31</a>, which is when EA will lift the veil on the game's multiplayer mode. After that, EA will continue to market and promote the game, saying EA is "all-in as a company on it."</p><p>Regarding the upcoming reveal, Wilson said, "This will be the first time people really see the true scale of what we've been building and get sneak peeks at whatâ€™s to come."</p><p>So far, it's been confirmed that Battlefield 6 will have multiplayer and single-player, while rumors and reports have suggested the Portal mode is coming back, while a battle royale mode is said to be in the works as well for sometime after launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6533386/" data-ref-id="1100-6533386">rumored to launch on October 10</a>, and preorders are said to begin on July 31. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-battlefield-6-coming-ea-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-charge-80-for-games/1100-6533540/" data-ref-id="1100-6533540">not expected to cost $80 for the standard edition, however. </a>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open beta for Battlefield 6</a> is also coming.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/">Peak</a> is, despite being a game about climbing massive mountains in order to be rescued from a crash landing on an uninhabited island, generally quite a sweet-looking game. It also released a new update yesterday, within the features section of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391?l=english" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> quite literally just saying "added cannibalism." As developers Aggro Crab and Landfall put it, "Totally normal update to the game. Nothing to see here."</p><p dir="ltr">This update comes in spite of Aggro Crab literally saying it <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1940498163875696969" rel="nofollow ">can't add cannibalism to Peak</a>, but hey, the people get what the people want. Luckily, this new feature doesn't force you to Hannibal-style cut up the cute little avatars that are your friends. Instead, when your player character is too hungry, your friends' avatars start to <a href="https://x.com/ava_lamp/status/1950341032844923029" rel="nofollow ">look like a walking rotisserie chicken</a>. If you manage to successfully eat them, they turn into a skeleton (and die, unsurprisingly).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrlUVhLBjG0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, cannibalism wasn't the only thing added in with this update. In the options menu you'll find a few new additions, like the ability to adjust your field of view while climbing, and a push-to-mute setting ("No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat"). There's also been some big fixes, one being a temporary solution to a bug that caused a lot of fall damage from short distances, and performance has been "greatly improved" too.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Patch 1.10.a Notes</h2><p><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Added cannibalism.</li></ul><p><b>Options:</b></p><ul><li>Polish and Turkish translations are in!</li><li>New Setting: "Climbing Extra Field Of View". This lets you adjust how the FOV changes while climbing.</li><li>New Setting: PUSH-TO-MUTE. This works the opposite way of "Push-To-Talk." No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat.</li><li>Settings that were previously hidden outside of the Main Menu will now show up but be disabled. Hopefully this reduces some confusion!</li></ul><p><b>Balance Changes:</b></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Trail Mix, Granola Bar, Medicinal Root, and Airline Food would not give extra hunger reduction after cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where cooking something Well-Done and then stashing it would remove the buffs. For reference, the intended behavior is that Well-Done items give the same bonus as Cooked items. It's your warning before it burns :)</li><li>Remedy Fungus now also cures poison in addition to injury, because it seems like it would.</li></ul><p><b>Major Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>We have a temporary solution to the FALL DAMAGE BUG where you would take a signifcant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance, often from spamming the climb and lunge buttons. A more comprehensive improvement will come in a later patch. Let us know if you still see any weird fall damage behavior!<br>EDIT: It seems like this only addressed the issue when sliding down while holding the wall, but not the one where you are on a slope. Sorry about that folks, we'll continue to investigate.</li><li>THE NAPBERRY PLANT IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED. Some folks were having issues with lag and crashes due to our implementation of the Napberry Plant. Trust me its a weird one. While we work on a better implementation asap, the Napberry Plant won't show up in the level.</li><li>Performance at the PEAK is greatly improved. It was the dang wildflowers.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item would get stuck in your "Hands" Item Slot. This issue happens when the server can't keep up with items that are swapped too rapidly, so a tiny delay has been added after swapping items before you're able to pick up a new item.</li></ul><p><b>Minor Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>You can no longer get the Bookworm Badge by simply reading the final page without the others.</li><li>Fixed an issue where reading the guidebook pages out of order could result in inconsistent stat tracking for the Bookworm Badge.</li><li>Removed an un-spatialized sound effect that would play when players landed from a fall.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Ticks counted as berries toward the Foraging Badge, lol.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item in the temporary slot would display the wrong amount of Cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where eating a Scorchberry wouldn't contribute toward the Forager Badge</li><li>Fixed an issue where getting an Anti-Rope Cannon wouldn't get you the Esoterica Badge.</li><li>You can no longer obtain progress achievements (such as Beachcomber Badge) while you are a ghost. Reaching a new area while alive should grant you achievements for all the areas completed that run.</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Battlegrounds might be literally built into the acronym PUBG, but Krafton sees something far bigger for the battle royale game's future. The company wants PUBG to become a "gameplay platform" in the vein of Fortnite and Roblox--featuring various modes and even user-made content.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/krafton-pubg-unreal-subnautica-donkey-kong-darth-vader" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a> reports that Krafton chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae discussed the company's expanded vision for PUBG on an earnings call earlier this week. "In the age of PUBG 2.0, it will not simply be a battle royale game per se," Bae said. The CFO wants the game to turn into a platform, noting that they're "developing wide-ranging modes under that objective."</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of this transition will include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">the switch to Unreal Engine 5 for PUBG</a>. Krafton has openly talked about this change since March 2024, with the Epic game engine opening up user-generated content to become a part of the experience. (Things have really come around, considering the PUBG Corp. once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">sued and then dropped a lawsuit against the Fortnite maker</a>.)</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a PUBG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/">spin-off in the works called PUBG: Blindspot</a>, previously known as Project Arc. The game is "a 5v5 team-based top-down tactical shooter," according to Krafton. Another spin-off in the same universe is reportedly an extraction shooter called PUBG: Black Budget.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-devs-lawsuit-demands-full-250-million-payout-and-creative-control/1100-6533246/">Krafton is currently embroiled in a lawsuit</a> with Unknown Worlds co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, who were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/">reportedly forced out from the developer</a> earlier this month. In the middle of this, Krafton has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-leak-is-real-krafton-confirms/1100-6533144/">confirmed an internal document leak for Subnautica 2 was legit</a>, pointing to multiple missed development milestones.</p>
