                <p>The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.</p><p>"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact," said Roh via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be "inevitable."</p><p>The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.</p><p>The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.</p><p>A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-reportedly-combatting-gpu-shortages-by-bringing-back-discontinued-graphics-card/1100-6537185/" data-ref-id="1100-6537185">by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs</a>. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.</p><p>As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.</p>
