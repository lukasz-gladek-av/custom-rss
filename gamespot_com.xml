                <p>Next month, Capcom will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to players just over seven years since the last mainline game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a>, debuted in 2018. There was an open beta for players in October, and now Capcom has announced that a second open beta in February. The news was accompanied by the following video, which features Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto using the create-a-character function to place himself in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of content, the new beta will be very similar to the one from last year. Players will still be able to use the character creator, try out the story trial, and complete the Slay Doshaguma quest. However, this version of the demo will also include Gypceros, a monster from the previous games who was absent in the first demo.</p><p>According to Tsujimoto, characters created in the first beta can be carried over to the second beta and to the final version of the game as well. However, game progress will not be transferable. The second open beta will be held over two weekends on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It will also be cross-platform, and the beta is open to all players regardless of whether they have Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Players who take part in the new beta will get bonus in-game rewards including a charm for a weapon and an item pack. The second beta will take place from February 6 at at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET until February 9 at the same time. Then the beta will have another weekend preview on February 13-16, presumably during the same hours as the previous event.</p><p>Tsujimoto noted that the team has implemented changes based on feedback to the first beta test, which attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. Unfortunately, those changes will not be in the next beta. Instead, Capcom will likely wait until the game's February 28 release date to implement those improvements.</p>

The latest rumor stems from peripheral company Genki, which is showing off accessories for the Switch 2 at CES and even reportedly telling one journalist that the system will launch in April.</p><p>Accessory manufacturers like Genki might get advance notice of upcoming hardware announcements, but there is no indication here that it's the case. Genki is also displaying what it claims to be a genuine replica of the Switch 2. The company apparently created a mock-up of the Switch 2 as a stand-in to show how Genki's accessories, including a docking station and case, will work for it.</p><p>The report from <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Numerama</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/case-maker-reportedly-reveals-switch-2-release-date-to-ces-atendees/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) also states that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">Switch 2's new Joy-Cons have an optical sensor</a> and a "C" button, the purpose of which is unknown.

                <p>AT CES 2025, Microsoft VP of Next Generation Jason Ronald teased a refreshed user experience for Windows handheld gaming PCs: one that could combine the best aspects of its operating system and Xbox. While Windows 11 allows for more choice--users can access Steam, Epic Games Store, and several other marketplaces--it can be a chore to use because it is natively designed for PCs and laptops--not handheld systems with much smaller screens.</p><p>"We've been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it's really about how do we bring those innovations that we've incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space," Ronald said an AMD and Lenovo event (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>). "I would say it's bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it's really locked to the console. What we're doing is we're really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem."</p><p>Ronald explained that Microsoft aims to bring a console-like experience to handhelds and "make Windows great for gaming" on any device. Microsoft will have more details to share later in the year, Ronald said, adding that the idea is to move away from a Windows desktop setup on handhelds and toward a "gaming-centric" experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox chief Phil Spencer has candidly spoken about the idea of a Xbox handheld device for several month, and it has been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">Microsoft is currently working on a prototype</a> that is still years away from being released. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/" data-ref-id="1100-6528686">Valve's SteamOS is coming to more PC gaming handhelds</a>, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S later this year.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy VII is among the most beloved entries in the series, but could there one day be another film adaptation? Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase said in an interview recently that, although nothing is "officially planned," he's aware of the game's appeal in Hollywood.</p><p>Kitase told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&amp;list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&amp;index=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Pena</a> that he's "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy VII, and many creators respect the title."</p><p>Kitase added: "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe. And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."</p><p>However, he confirmed "no talks have been had" about making Final Fantasy VII into a Hollywood movie.</p><p>Square Enix has already launched a Final Fantasy VII movie, having released the 2005 anime Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Directed by veteran artist Tetsuya Nomura, the straight-to-DVD film takes place a couple years after the events of the game.</p><p>Before this, actor Robert Pattinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-stars-robert-pattinson-john-david-washington/1100-6481355/" data-ref-id="1100-6481355">Final Fantasy VII was one of his favorite video games, pointing out how it made him cry</a>. He also discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-pattinson-discusses-final-fantasy-7-love-triangle/1100-6501075/" data-ref-id="1100-6501075">being in love with both Aeris and Tifa in a love triangle.</a></p><p>While there is no new Final Fantasy VII movie in the works right now, Hollywood is pressing ahead with numerous adaptations. Just this week, Sony announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-are-officially-in-development/1100-6528663/" data-ref-id="1100-6528663">movie versions of Helldivers and Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/" data-ref-id="1100-6528665">Until Dawn movie</a>, meanwhile, debuts this April, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-director-explains-why-it-isnt-called-the-minecraft-movie/1100-6527977/" data-ref-id="1100-6527977">A Minecraft Movie comes out the same month.</a></p><p>As for the game series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the newest extension of the popular game, itself serving as a sequel to 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake. A third entry in the remake series is now in the works.</p>
