                <p>Russia is looking to enter the video game console space by creating its own systems, and the country is reportedly planning on making two different kinds as it continues to feel the economic impact of its illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106133-russia-admits-domestic-consoles-cant-match-ps5-or.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechSpot</a>, one of them is reportedly a traditional console using the Elbrus processor, which is developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies. This processor is mainly used for applications such as critical infrastructure and defense. It's also reportedly going to use a domestic OS--either Aurora or Alt Linux.</p><p>In a statement on <a href="https://t.me/webstrangler/3937" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram</a>, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on information policy Anton Gorelkin confirmed that Elbrus processors aren't as powerful as the ones used in PS5 or Xbox, so Russia will have to take a unique approach to its consoles.</p><p>He also said that it won't be designed to play ports of older games, but serve as a platform to encourage domestic video game development.</p><p>The second console is reportedly a cloud-based one built by the Russian telecommunications firm MTS and will cost $45. It will reportedly utilize MTS' Fog Play--its cloud-based gaming platform that lets owners of high-end PCs to charge an hourly price to those with less powerful machines.</p><p>As Russia has been sanctioned due to its invasion of Ukraine, the government is looking to promote more domestic technology. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated the government to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/102440-putin-orders-creation-russian-game-consoles-cloud-delivery.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create its own video game consoles</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-russia-is-infiltrating-gaming-communities/1100-6513243/" data-ref-id="1100-6513243">Microsoft has said that Russia has been infiltrating the gaming community</a>.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, players have looked for any sign that Valve is moving forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-half-life-3-anytime-soon-if-ever-new-report-suggests/1100-6498401/" data-ref-id="1100-6498401">Half-Life 3</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-gets-big-20th-anniversary-update-as-new-information-on-episode-3-revealed/1100-6527820/" data-ref-id="1100-6527820">20th anniversary of Half-Life 2</a> came and went without any announcement about the long-awaited sequel. Now, actor Mike Shapiro, who voices the enigmatic G-Man in the Half-Life games, has shared a cryptic New Year's message on X that has some fans speculating that Half-Life 3 could finally arrive this year.</p><p>In the brief recording, Shapiro revisits his unsettling G-Man voice as he says, "May the next quarter century deliver as many unexpected surprises, as did the millennium's first." He then cryptically notes that time is fluid like music, before adding that he'll "see you in the new year."</p><p>This message follows a previous report by Valve leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabe Follower</a>, who claims that Half-Life 3 recently entered play testing for "family and friends of Valve developers." If so, that would be a remarkable cone of silence from the trusted few, since there haven't been many other reports that suggest a new game is closer than expected.</p><p>Fans of the series have been eagerly hoping for some kind of resolution to the cliffhanger ending of the 2007 expansion Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which left the heroes in dire straights. There were originally plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-writer-shares-episode-3-details/1100-6452861/" data-ref-id="1100-6452861">Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>, which <span>would have been set in the Arctic. According to the Half-Life 2 documentary released by Valve last year, Episode 3 was in development for six months before it was abandoned. Instead, the team went to work on</span><span> Left 4 Dead. Since then, the only new title in the franchise was the VR game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-alyx-review-catch-these-hands/1900-6417437/" data-ref-id="1900-6417437">Half-Life: Alyx</a> in 2020.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tango Gameworks is dead; long live Tango Gameworks Inc. That's the new "reborn" name of the Hi-Fi Rush studio, which is now officially a part of PUBG publisher Krafton Inc. Tango began last year under the Xbox Game Studios umbrella before a tumultuous few months saw the developer almost shuttered permanently before Krafton stepped in.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/tangogameworks/status/1874259495783981205?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Tango announced the studio's "new start" earlier this week and said it's "excited to continue crafting games that bring joy to players around the world." This is the first post from the official Tango account since May 7, 2024, when <a href="https://x.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the developer stated that it would "close."</a> That message was a result of Tango being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">one of four studios that Microsoft shut down at the time</a>, which also included Redfall's Arkane Austin.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in August, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">Tango was saved by Krafton</a>, with Hi-Fi Rush rights being acquired as well. The studio was started in 2010 and known for the survival-horror series The Evil Within, which will apparently stay with Microsoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-started-work-on-hi-fi-rush-2-before-microsoft-closure/1100-6526814/" data-ref-id="1100-6526814">Hi-Fi Rush 2 was being worked on before Microsoft closed down Tango</a>, though the sequel isn't officially on the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-2-probably-wont-make-krafton-any-cash-but-but-thats-ok/1100-6526573/" data-ref-id="1100-6526573">Krafton realizes Hi-Fi Rush 2 might not make any money, and that's okay</a> for the company--if Tango decides to move forward with that project.</p><p dir="ltr">Krafton CEO Changhan Kim stated last year that giving Tango the support to continue being creative and developing new experiences was key.

                <p>Game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">provided an update</a> on his in-development games, including Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, OD, and Physint. Starting with the latter two, both were impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike for video game actors, which began in July 2024 and remains ongoing.</p><p>For OD, which is in the works alongside Microsoft and Xbox, Kojima said his teams "developed the game" and did scanning efforts for environments and the actors themselves. Scanning and filming for OD was suspended due to the strike, however. For Physint, which is being published by Sony, Kojima said casting was suspended due to the strike. "We hope to resume [in 2025]," Kojima said.</p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, Kojima said, "We started to play and build up the game." He added that his teams conducted music production and recording, along with ADR for the actors.</p><p>Games that went into development prior to September 2023 are understood to be exempt from the strike, along ongoing with live-service games. This likely explains why OD and Physint were impacted but Death Stranding 2 was not.</p><p>OD will feature the actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, with Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele contributing to the script. The cast for Physint, meanwhile, is unknown at this point. Death Stranding 2, meanwhile, features Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, Troy Baker, Elle Fanning, and other celebrities.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year.</a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>Beyond games, Kojima said preparations and planning are underway for the Death Stranding movie and "other adaptations" of Kojima's games. When Physint was announced, Kojima also confirmed a partnership with Sony's Columbia Pictures, so it seems there could be a Physint film in the works as well.</p><p>Kojima attended The Game Awards in December 2024, but had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-on-lack-of-announcements-at-the-game-awards-sorry-about-that/1100-6528464/" data-ref-id="1100-6528464">no announcements to share.</a></p>
