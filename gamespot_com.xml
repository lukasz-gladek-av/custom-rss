                <p>This week, From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-characters-for-6-hours/2300-6466558/" data-ref-id="2300-6466558">two new playable characters</a>, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.</p><p>One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.</p><p>The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been "mitigated."</p><p>If you want to unlock The Forsaken Hollows' new characters and face the new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting the new DLC</a>.

For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form.</p><p>This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art.</p><p>If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.</p></div>                      </div><h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQXSKLWQ,B0FQXH13RT,B0FQY47SLH&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Where to Buy Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo</a></h3><hr><p>If you haven't picked up the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo, all three are in stock at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXH13RT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samus</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXSKLWQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samus &amp;
