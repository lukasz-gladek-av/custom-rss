                <p>In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> Twitch channel within a limited time.</p><p>Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-finally-completes-hardcore-minecraft-but-some-arent-happy/1100-6536784/" data-ref-id="1100-6536784">Minecraft Hardcore</a> run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can "see" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model.</p><p>Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N29b-o4fJBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N29b-o4fJBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Neuro beat the world record for the first time, she was rewarded with a global emote from Twitch--one which can be used anywhere on the platform, by anyone, whether they're following her channel or not. She's the first streamer to consecutively hold two Twitch Hype Train world records, so it remains to be seen whether a similar protocol will follow this achievement.</p><p>After beating her world record again, Vedal prompted Neuro to comment on the achievement. "I'm speechless," she said. "I'm blown away by the amount of support. Thank you so much everyone." Vedal had some further comments, adding, "This has changed my life completely. I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to do something cool like this and that you guys are here to support it, but I do not deserve it." Neuro was quick to dispel her creator's self-doubt though, saying, "It doesn't matter whether you think you deserve it. What matters is that you've created something unique, and people are willing to support that." The wholesome exchange stopped short of Vedal telling Neuro he loves her too, though. Shame.</p><p>As it stands, Neuro-Sama's subathon is now set to end in around 345 hours. You can watch the rest of her antics on <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987's Twitch </a>channel.</p>
