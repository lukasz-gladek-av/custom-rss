                <p dir="ltr">AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. </p><p dir="ltr">AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Power and pricing</h2><p dir="ltr">AMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190"></a><figcaption>Asus is launching three RX 9060 XT models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for performance, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is positioned as the replacement for AMD's RX 7600 XT as its flagship entry-level GPU, making it the primary competitor to Nvidia's $300 GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (which costs either $380 for the 8GB version or $429 for the 16GB version). According to AMD's Computex 2025 presentation, the company's internal testing found the RX 9060 XT is roughly six percent faster than the RTX 5060 Ti on 40 games running at 1440p--and at roughly $80 MSRP cheaper. However, those tests compare the RX 9060 XT 16GB to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, rather than the RTX 5060 16GB. The RX 9060 8GB model's performance is a bigger question, as the smaller amount of VRAM could lead to significant performance dips.</p><p dir="ltr">On X (formerly Twitter), AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, Frank Azor, explained that most players use a 1080p display, for which 8GB of VRAM is more than enough. While technically true, it doesn't alleviate the concerns over confusing consumers who may see the above comparisons of the RX 9060 XT 16GB's 6% performance boost over the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and assume that applies to <em>all </em>RX 9060 XT models. And again, the actual performance will likely differ between the various SKUs launching June 5, which could further compound the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory. Most played games WW are mostly esports games. We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory…</p>  — Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find the AMD RX 9060 XT</h2><p dir="ltr">Those potential concerns and unanswered questions aside, the RX 9060 XT nevertheless looks like a solid entry-level choice for those already invested in AMD's hardware. As mentioned above, multiple manufacturers are releasing RX 9060 XT GPUs starting June 5, and while none are currently listed for preorder, you can learn more about the models announced from <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9060xt-o16g/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>, <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/components/graphics-cards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/All-Series?fid=3124" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte</a>, at each company's online store. Other brands like PowerColor also showed off upcoming RX 9060 XT GPUs on the Computex 2025 show floor. We'll be sure to update this post once the GPUs are available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>
