                <p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has openly addressed the intense backlash toward the open-world samurai-ninja adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, claiming that the shift from "gameplay to ideology" was responsible for its delay from November 15, 2024 to February 14, 2025.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 5 Game File report</a>, Guillemot showed a video to an audience of games industry insiders during the first day of Paris Games Week, which ran from October 30 to November 2 at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. The video was 184 seconds long, professionally narrated, and detailed Ubisoft's response to the vitriol the company faced.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><strong>"</strong>What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences? ... Only to become the game everyone loves to hate?" the narrator asks at the start of the video. "When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire? And when the voices you thought were with you actually turn against you."</p><p>The video's narrator described the ire Ubisoft experienced after it revealed Shadows in 2024. To combat the ferocity, the company "had to stop focusing on those who hated us [and] start firing up our allies." Doing that meant one thing, according to the narrator: Ubisoft had to lean on The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p>"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game," the narrator continued. "The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows."</p><p>The video lathers on this corporate speak for the rest of its runtime, according to a transcript in that November 5 Game File report. The narrator says that, by showing the game and letting the experience speak for itself, Ubisoft won fans back, shifted the conversation, and found the confidence to "stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters." There's no explicit mention of who the "haters" were, and Guillemot doesn't define the backlash Shadows faced in his remarks after the video either. However, he did hint at the "fake fights" caused by the tension between gameplay and history.</p><p>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” Guillemot said. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.</p><p>"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game--everything they were going to be able to rediscover--of what they love about Assassin’s Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot continued. "And so they’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.' So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games. It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows received intense backlash for Yasuke, a Black slave who became a retainer for Oda Nobunaga, making him a samurai by association. The game was slammed for everything from being "woke propaganda" to featuring historical inaccuracies, and grew so intense that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft reportedly canceled a Civil War-inspired Assassin's Creed game</a> as a direct result. Despite all the controversy surrounding Shadows' Black co-protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">the game still reached five million players</a> just five months after its February 14 launch.</p><p>The game, which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">an 8/10 in GameSpot's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">the Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that introduced tons of new content.

                <p>The worlds of Silent Hill and Castlevania have crossed over with Dead by Daylight before, but the latest collaboration between Konami and Behaviour Interactive is taking things even further into The Fog. This time, Silent Hill's Pyramid Head and Castlevania's Dracula are teaming up as The Executioner and The Dark Lord. And they aren't the only guest characters in this 2v8 battle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoxhwNgPaGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoxhwNgPaGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dead by Daylight's Silent Hill X Castlevania collaboration starts today, November 6, and extends through November 20. Both of the series' respective villains will be joined by a pair of returning heroes: Silent Hill 3's Cheryl Mason and Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. All four characters are available for free during the 2v8 battles for the duration of this event.</p><p>There are also four new outfits--one for each of the returning characters. Trevor's Legendary Outfit essentially transforms him into his descendant, Richter Belmont. Dracula's alternate look is called the Scorched Terror Outfit. Basically, it's what Dracula looks like when he's left in the sun long enough for his skin to blister and peel.</p><p>Cheryl's alternate look is the Awakened Order outfit, which features her as she "embraces a sinister ritual." As for Pyramid Head, he's a glutton for punishment with his Flayed Torturer outfit, which is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Earlier this year, Dead by Daylight had crossover collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-walking-dead-heroes-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6533018/" data-ref-id="1100-6533018">The Walking Dead's heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-hits-new-player-count-record-with-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover/1100-6532544/" data-ref-id="1100-6532544">Five Nights At Freddy's murderous animatronics</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evils-greatest-monsters-unite-in-first-look-at-new-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/1100-6529360/" data-ref-id="1100-6529360">Resident Evil characters</a>. Knowing this game, there are almost certainly more crossovers coming after this one.</p>

As of today, GTA 5's multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is included with the membership on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it was free on PS5 for a period of time. Now, however, it costs $20 on its own.</p><p>GTA+ costs $8/month, and there is no annual plan. The subscription service is available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but GTA Online is not included with GTA+ on PC, only console.</p><p>One of the perks of GTA+ is access to a library of Rockstar games, and GTA Online is just the latest. The others include GTA: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, GTA 3 - The Definitive Edition, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA: Chinatown Wars.
