                <p>Activision continues to stock the Call of Duty in-game store with new bundles, and the latest lets you become a legally distinct version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Rocket Raccoon. Or at least that's what people are saying about the new "Cash Bandit" store bundle that went live today, November 26, for Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p>The bundle comes with the "Raccoon Goon" skin for Niran, along with the "Debt Collector" weapon skin for the Sirin 9mm special weapon that was recently released. There is also a "Vault Security" GPR 91 assault rifle blueprint included with the bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962"></a><figcaption>This is not Rocket Raccoon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg"></figure><p>The raccoon skin also includes a weapon reticle called "Cash Flow," along with a finishing move labeled "Disarmed." What's more, the bundle includes a raccoon-themed decal and weapon charm, as well as a one-hour double XP token. This DLC bundle costs 2,800 COD Points, which is about $20 USD.</p><p>This isn't the first Call of Duty store bundle that bears a resemblance to a Guardians of the Galaxy character. Activision previously released the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-evil-groot-skin-with-this-big-change/1100-6520390/" data-ref-id="1100-6520390">Gaia skin for 2023's Modern Warfare III that looked a lot like Groot </a>from the Marvel superhero franchise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-3WAwZIbIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I-3WAwZIbIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you don't want to become a raccoon but want to play Call of Duty as an animal, the in-game store was also recently stocked with a bundle that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-now-lets-you-become-a-muscly-shark/1100-6528027/" data-ref-id="1100-6528027">turns you into a shark with huge muscles.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">the month's best-selling game in the US</a>, and is already the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, it's been reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the future of the mega-franchise</a>, while the first supposed information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sledgehammer-games-reportedly-leading-development-on-2027s-call-of-duty/1100-6528047/" data-ref-id="1100-6528047">2027's Call of Duty game</a> has emerged.</p>

This is more than just a brand-new map for Zombies in Black Ops 6, as Citadelle des Morts represents a key development in the ongoing Zombies narrative, as it merges some of the existing Treyarch storylines that had previously been unconnected. Here's what you need to know before the map arrives on December 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The final storyline cutscene for the Terminus map throws a bunch of names at you, and if you haven't played Black Ops 4 or Vanguard Zombies, these mentions may not mean anything to you, but for longtime fans this connects all of the stories in an intriguing way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Citadelle des Morts Zombies Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some spoilers ahead:</strong> The final Terminus cinematics reveals that Edward Richtofen has been seeking Prima Materia and the Sentinel Artifacts, which are the main elements of Treyarch's Chaos storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 introduced a completely new set of Zombies characters for the Chaos storyline, which, until now, has been unconnected to the Aether storyline that involves the original Zombies cast of Edward Richtofen, Takeo Masaki, Tank Dempsey, and Nikolai Belinsk. Black Ops 4's cast of Chaos characters chased down Sentinel Artifacts, which were relics created by an Earth-mined substance known as Prima Materia.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 4, Prima Materia is revealed as a substance that brought so much power that it corrupted and destroyed whole civilizations. It's no shock that Richtofen is seeking this kind of power, but it could have a catastrophic outcome if he gains possession of a Sentinel Artifact. It's also revealed that a Sentinel Artifact might be able to harness the power needed to bring back Samantha Maxis from the Dark Aether. Samantha Maxis sacrificed herself in the final cutscene for Black Ops Cold War Zombies in order to seal the Dark Aether breach and stop the Zombies boss called the Forsaken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957"></a><figcaption>The Terminus cutscene's mention of a Sentinel Artifact</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Terminus cutscene also tells us that Richtofen hired a French syndicate to help him find a Sentinel Artifact. This syndicate is led by Franco Moreau, and he has employed the help of Sergei Ravenov, who has abducted a man named Gabriel Krafft to interrogate for knowledge on the artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">This part of the cutscene drops some interesting names, yet it's also a little confusing. Chronologically, Sergei Ravenov was last seen helping members of the Terminus crew stop the Outbreak incursions in Black Ops Cold War. Gabriel Krafft, on the other hand, was a demonologist in Vanguard Zombies who studied these Sentinel Artifacts. He was shown as a very old man during the time of World War II, so it will be interesting to see how the story explains he is sill alive in 1991. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861441696099115196" rel="nofollow ">Treyarch even teases this</a> for the trailer reveal, referring to Krafft as "the man who should not be alive." Maybe Kraftt has resorted to using some kind of relic for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">The mystery of Kraftt's survival and the chase for a Sentinel Artifact makes Season 1 of Black Ops an exciting time to be a Zombies fan. We'll now be playing as the Terminus crew, who are headed to a castle in Europe to rescue Vanguard's Gabriel Krafft from a dangerous syndicate in order to help locate Black Ops 4's Sentinel Artifact before the powerful relic gets in the hands of Edward Richtofen. The Terminus crew not only wants to stop Richtofen, but now they're looking to use the power for themselves in order to bring Samantha Maxis back.</p><p dir="ltr">The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">cinematic trailer for Citadelle des Morts can be viewed here</a>, which shows the Terminus crew have now fled the prison island, and they've reconnected with Sergei Ravenov. They ask him to turn against the French syndicate, explaining to him that Krafft might know how to bring Samantha back.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more story and map details closer to launch. In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include Perk-a-Cola, a new field upgrade, a new ammo mod, and more Augments to unlock. The map's main story quest will also go live simultaneously with the launch.</p>

                <p>Australia has built a reputation as having one of the strictest video game rating systems on the planet, and it appears as though another highly anticipated game won't reach the country's shores when it's released next year.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, the fighting game based on the popular anime, has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), officially preventing the game from being sold in the country. The group listed no reason for the decision, but with the ACB having set a precedent with other games with similar ratings, and the reasoning behind them, it could be a few possibilities.</p><p>The main suspected reason is how drug use has a gameplay benefit, like granting speed or strength, or portraying drug use in a positive light. For example, if a character even gets health restored from narcotics, that game would likely be refused classification (RC). Disco Elysium: The Final Cut was originally banned because of this, but that decision was later overturned after the ACB agreed that player performance actually showed "negative impacts from depictions of drug use."</p><p>Other potential reasons include on-screen depictions of sexual violence and sexualized depictions of characters who appear to be under 18. South Park: The Stick of Truth was banned for the same reasons as the game involves an underaged main character getting anally probed by aliens. A censored version was released replacing those scenes with a card of a koala crying explaining what has been cut out.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact is being developed by Eighting, a close collaborator with Nintendo, having contributed to Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Pikmin 4, and Nintendo Switch Sports. The game is scheduled to be released on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC, but unless publisher Arc System Works decides to appeal, Australian fans will sadly miss out.</p>

                <p>Section 9 Interactive, a studio composed of former Tarsier Studios devs responsible for the first two<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/"> Little</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/" data-ref-id="5000-456964"> Nightmares</a> games, has announced today it's inked a deal with Epic Games Publishing to bring its upcoming game to PC and consoles. The game doesn't have an announced name yet, but by the looks of it, some of the Little Nightmares aesthetic will carry over into this debut project from the studio.</p><p>Despite the creepy enemies and shadowy atmosphere, the studio doesn't describe the game as horror. Instead, it considers it a "sci-fi action-adventure" game built in Unreal Engine 5. Still, some of the enemies shown in the game's work-in-progress assets like the one below have a certain "In space, no one can hear you scream" vibe about them. No release window has yet been revealed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888" data-ratio="0.56070287539936" data-width="626" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888"></a><figcaption>I'm not sure what to call this thing, but instinctively, I know to run from it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png"></figure><p>For Epic, this signing follows its most high-profile work yet in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, which launched last year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 to universal acclaim. The game originally launched as a digital-only title, but as of a few weeks ago, it now has a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/"> physical version available for consoles</a>. Echoing what Remedy had said of its partner, Section 9 said Epic Publishing has "given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher."</p><p>Other ongoing Epic Publishing deals include the long-gestating next game from Playdead, the studio behind indie darlings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/limbo/" data-ref-id="5000-70518">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inside/" data-ref-id="5000-285251">Inside</a>, as well as Fumito Ueda's studio GenDesign. Ueda is best known for his work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ico/" data-ref-id="5000-2864">Ico</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/" data-ref-id="5000-22230">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-guardian/" data-ref-id="5000-39026">The Last Guardian</a>.</p><p>As for Section 9, it's not the only studio working on something that captures something like Little Nightmares' unnerving atmosphere. Tarsier, the series' original developer, is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/" data-ref-id="5000-640431">Reanimal</a>, while Supermassive has been handed the reins to create the next sequel in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, CD Projekt Red released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-official-modding-tool-arrives-soon-will-let-users-edit-almost-anything/1100-6523245/" data-ref-id="1100-6523245">REDkit</a>, the official modding tool for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. While that opened up a world of possibilities for PC players, the core game has just received an incredible visual upgrade that may even surpass the title's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">2022 next-gen update</a>.</p><p>A modder who goes by Halk Hogan released The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition, which claims to raise "the game's visuals to the highest level yet and enhance it to a truly next-gen masterpiece." To back up those remarks, Halk Hogan has posted a 15-minute side-by-side comparison on YouTube that shows off the improvements.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD1mNA4Efcw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jD1mNA4Efcw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition is now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9963" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a>. According to the description, "Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent and as faithful as possible reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of the Witcher."</p><p>As part of an earnings report earlier this week, CD Projekt Red revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">The Witcher 4 is officially in production</a>, and the announcement came alongside an enigmatic teaser image. That game is probably still several years away from reaching players. In the meantime, Liam Hemsworth will be taking over the role of Geralt from Henry Cavill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">The Witcher Season 4</a> on Netflix. That will debut in 2025, but the franchise's next anime project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-anime-gets-release-date-and-trailer/1100-6526538/" data-ref-id="1100-6526538">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>, will arrive sooner on February 11, 2025.</p>

Customization is the main reason. The Ultimate has two remappable back triggers and a dedicated app for PC, Mac, and mobile devices that lets you tweak various features. You can remap inputs, set up three custom profiles to cycle through on the fly, and adjust the sensitivity of the sticks, dual rumble motors, and triggers. You can also create dead zones and program macros.</p><p>And unlike the Switch Pro Controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate has Hall Effect analog sticks, which mitigates the risk of stick drift.</p><p>The Ultimate is a well-designed controller that feels great to hold. I think the Switch Pro Controller has slightly better ergonomics, so I personally switch back and forth between the two controllers. If I'm playing a game with a bunch of control inputs like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Echoes of Wisdom, I like the convenience of the back buttons on the Ultimate.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth comes with a matching charging dock with a compartment housing the 2.4GHz adapter. You can use the optional adapter on PC, Mac, or Steam Deck to play wirelessly on those platforms. You can also sync the controller to iPhone or Android via Bluetooth.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC\/dp\/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">8BitDo Ultimate 2.4GHz Wireless Controller for PC</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC\/dp\/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$40 (was $50)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li>Works with PC, Mac, Steam Deck</li><li>Available in white, black, and purple</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks</li><li>Two remappable back triggers</li><li>Connects wirelessly with 2.4GHz dongle</li><li>Optional USB-C wired mode</li><li>Up to 15 hours battery life</li><li>Includes matching charging dock</li></ul><p><strong>Customize with 8BitDo Ultimate Software for PC/Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Set up three custom profiles</li><li>Set up dead zones</li><li>Adjust stick sensitivity</li><li>Adjust trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjust rumble intensity</li><li>Create dead zones</li></ul><p>8BitDo's 2.4GHz-only model, which leads the way on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controllers</a>, is also on sale for Black Friday 2024.

It gets up to 15 hours of battery life and comes with a matching charging dock. This is also a solid controller for playing Steam Deck in docked mode.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><hr><p>If you're looking for a handheld Switch controller not named Joy-Con during the sale, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamecube-enthusiasts-can-get-this-cool-switch-handheld-controller-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6523811/" data-ref-id="1100-6523811">check out this GameCube-inspired controller</a>, which is 30% off at Amazon for Black Friday.</p><hr><h3>Amazon Black Friday Sale:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul>
