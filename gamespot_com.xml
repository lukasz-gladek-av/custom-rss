                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952">lot of new content this week</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Into the Unjust update</a>, but if you're a scoleciphobiac, you might want to steer clear of the Terminid Hive Worlds for now. As players have discovered, gigantic Hive Lords that can give Destiny 2's Hive Worm gods a run for their money are lurking beneath the surface, and they're the <em>devil </em>to kill.</p><p>Easily one of the biggest bosses to date in Helldivers 2, Hive Lords boast an incredible amount of health and are covered in rocky scales of armor. These bullet-sponges can shrug off just about anything you can throw at them, and while they aren't unkillable, a Helldivers team is going to need to call in multiple drops of anti-tank weaponry and hellbombs to take down this skyscraper-sized titan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ34QSm-nJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZ34QSm-nJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fighting a Hive Lord is challenging enough, but defending yourself from one is also a Herculean labor. The massive worms can burrow underground for surprise attacks, erupting to shower the battlefield with rocks or flatten you with their sheer mass. If that wasn't bad enough, they can blanket the area in corrosive bile, forcing teams to stay on the move during these fights.</p><p>So far, the best strategy for dealing with a Hive Lord is a classic from Arthurian legend: <a href="https://youtu.be/MUG9VzHoEoc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run away</a>. Sure, a Hive Lord has a few exposed areas under its armor and a mouth that an anti-tank rocket can comfortably fit inside of, but the best course of action here is to strategically retreat and carry on with your regular mission objectives.</p><p>Hive Lords require an absurd amount of resources to take down--<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/" rel="nofollow ">one team says it used 10 Hellbombs, eight 500KG bombs, and several stratagems to get the job done</a>--and so far it looks like there's no reward for killing one, other than the sweet feeling of protecting democracy for another day from the monster.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-647672">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is the latest survival horror game from Bloober Team, the developer behind the Silent Hill 2 remake last year. This original game blends survival horror with sci-fi, taking place in an alternate history Poland in the 1960s, under Soviet control. You explore the destroyed and life-less city, looking for jump points to find people in the past who could help prevent disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips and guides on the toughest parts of Cronos: The New Dawn check out our guide on the optional <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-the-hospital-chapel-puzzle-in-cronos-the-new-dawn/1100-6534152/">Hospital Chapel puzzle</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the completion time of three members of the GameSpot team, Cronos: The New Dawn will take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete. While there is some optional exploration and puzzle-solving to be done, the biggest swing in playtimes will come down to how difficult you find the combat to be. Cronos: The New Dawn has some tough encounters and restrictive inventory management, which could result in you getting stuck on some of the harder combat challenges.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list</h2><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn comprises four major sections rather than distinct chapter names, so there is no true Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list per se.. The location names don't contain any spoilers beyond what kind of areas you will eventually explore. Between these areas, you will often travel back to a hubspace inside a defunct tram station, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn sections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Apartments</li><li dir="ltr">Steelworks</li><li dir="ltr">Hospital</li><li dir="ltr">Church Abbey</li></ul>

                <p>The Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app gets a little bit bigger tomorrow, as the House of Mario revealed that the classic shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forsaken-1998/" data-ref-id="5000-103">Forsaken 64</a> will be making its way to the app on September 4. As always, this is only for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, and you'll need to have the Mature version of the Nintendo 64 app downloaded in order to play it. Forsaken 64 is actually only the fifth game to release on the Mature app, joining other classics like Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who might be on the younger side, Forsaken 64 is a shooter that first released way back in 1998 on the original Nintendo 64, as well as PlayStation and PC. It's set in the still-far-off year of 2113, where all life on Earth has been wiped out following a science experiment that caused a shockwave to hit the entire planet. The N64 version is actually unique compared to the PlayStation and PC versions--in the latter two, you play as someone trying to obtain some lost treasure, whereas in the former you play as a character trying to thwart said thieves by taking them down.</p><p dir="ltr">A big thing that sets the game apart from that era of shooters is its movement--the game has a full six degrees of freedom, meaning you can move backwards and forwards, side to side, up and down, and combinations of all of those too. You'll also be able to play in multiplayer with up to four players at once like in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">Forsaken 64 releases on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app on September 4.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Former PlayStation exclusive game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">opened up the floodgates to Xbox Series X|S users</a>. And while Helldivers 2 remains immensely popular, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani has indicated that his team has had trouble adjusting the game because the majority of players aren't offering any feedback about it.</p><p>"The vast, vast majority silently play the game--they don't post here or on Reddit," wrote Joriani on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1411450096058368114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-ceo-says-the-vast-majority-of-people-silently-play-the-shooter-which-means-the-devs-cant-just-look-at-reddit-and-what-streamers-are-saying-for-feedback-this-is-a-challenge-for-all-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "When we do good, we [see] this in the stats. And when we don't, we also see it--sometimes it overlaps with what influencers or people say in social media--often it does not. So we use different tools to calibrate our compass."</p><p>Jorjani noted that the developers do listen to feedback from Helldivers 2 players who stream their games. However, he feels that they represent "the play style of a minority," while also setting "standards for many as they have a platform to broadcast and many who look." Ultimately, Joriani indicated that Arrowhead makes changes and fixes by balancing out external feedback with "a lot of data, metrics. and qualitative data."</p><p>Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, which is apparently attributed to the influx of Xbox gamers.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Crew - Calling All Units Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/">Ubisoft shut down The Crew servers</a> in March 2024, making the game unplayable since it requires an online connection. That means owners of the game couldn't even check out the single-player campaign. This led to a couple of fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-facing-lawsuit-after-the-crew-was-removed-from-platforms/1100-6527713/">filing a lawsuit against Ubisoft over The Crew situation</a>. In the aftermath of the uproar, Ubisoft has announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-anger-over-first-games-shutdown-the-crew-2s-new-offline-mode-detailed/1100-6531111/">offline modes are on the way for The Crew 2 and The Crew: Motorfest</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a Stop Killing Games movement that started after The Crew was shut down. In July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-addresses-the-stop-killing-games-movement/1100-6533318/">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot was asked about the campaign</a> during a shareholders meeting. "And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever," said Guillemot at the time. "But that's an issue that we're working on. That's something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crew originally launched in late 2014 on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360. The game then received two expansions: Wild Run and Calling All Units.

                <p>Earlier this summer, developer Wargaming shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-2-0-adds-tier-xi-tanks-new-pve-campaign-and-more-next-month/1100-6534078/" data-ref-id="1100-6534078">the first look at World of Tanks 2.0</a>, a massive update that may be the biggest one to date for the 15-year-old game. Now, the 2.0 update is live and players can dive into a new story-driven PvE mode and take out 16 new Tier XI tanks for a test drive on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTEkzHeiafg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FTEkzHeiafg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the other changes to the game include a redesigned hanger and user interface, an upgraded matchmaker, and "a comprehensive rebalance of hundreds of vehicles." A new Scandinavian map, Nordskar, will be the site of the PvE Event, "Operation Boiling Point." That's where players can try out three different Tier XI tanks.</p><p>Wargaming has also stated that the sound upgrades will include "heavier, more authentic tank sounds recorded from real vehicles." The developer is also rewarding longtime players who started before the 2.0 update with one full tech-tree branch (Tier VI–X), 2,500 Gold,15,000 Bonds, 10 million Credits, and 60 days of premium access.</p><p>Players who join after today's update will also get a few freebies, including two full tech-tree branches (Tier VI–X), three premium tanks, 60 days of premium, 6 million credits, and more. There are also exclusive awards waiting for players who already own all of the Tier VI–X vehicles. Every player who logs in from now to mid-October will receive "epic gifts," according to Wargaming.</p>

                <p>Video game consoles typically become cheaper the longer they've been on the market, but the current generation has been the exception to that rule due to various factors. Over in Europe, prospective PS5 owners might have to settle for a Sony console that offers less, as it has been reported that the internal SSD capacity is being shrunk so that Sony can avoid raising the price of the hardware yet again.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to leaker Billbil-kun</a>, the PS5 Digital Edition SSD will shrink from 1TB to 825GB starting with the next console chassis-E revision when it's available to purchase on September 13. As Billbil-kun noted, PS5 Digital Edition consoles originally sold for €399 when they launched in 2020, with the price increasing to €449 and €499 (around $582) eventually. The regular PS5 console with a disc drive is expected to retain its 1TB SSD.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨 UPCOMING RELEASE 🚨<br>PS5 Slim Chassis E (CFI-2100) is dropping soon...<br>But there's a catch 👀<br>📉 Digital Edition will come with less SSD storage<br>Full details below 🔽<a href="https://t.co/JTzhQ0alKV" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/JTzhQ0alKV</a></p>  — billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This year has been expensive for anyone looking to purchase a PS5 console. In April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/">Sony announced price increases for Digital and Standard Edition PS5 consoles</a> across Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and in August, the price of every PS5 console system went up by $50 in the US. At the time, Sony said it was continuing to "navigate a challenging economic environment," and it had to pass the cost on to consumers.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1958185512075690196" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analyst Daniel Ahmad noted</a> that higher tariff rates on countries where the PS5 is produced--China (30%), Japan (15%), Vietnam (20%), and Malaysia (19%)--had forced its hand, following the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/trumps-tariffs-rekindle-global-trade-tensions.html" rel="nofollow ">announcement of new tariffs</a> by US President Donald Trump earlier this year.</p><p>This isn't an isolated case either. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">announced price hikes for its Xbox consoles</a> in May, and Nintendo hasn't ruled out the possibility of raising the price of the Switch 2 in the future, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/">following the increase to Switch 2 accessory prices</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
