                <p>In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhp-FUuC7s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zkhp-FUuC7s?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.</p><p>As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's "frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game." It goes on to speculate that The Outer Worlds 2 may have utilized some proprietary hardware features in Xbox Series X|S that neither the PS5 nor PS5 Pro have.</p><p>Obsidian Entertainment recently introduced players to Outer Worlds 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-outer-worlds-2-companions-whom-you-cant-romance/1100-6534102/" data-ref-id="1100-6534102">six companion characters who can't be romanced</a>, before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-outer-worlds-2-companions-will-turn-on-you-if-you-screw-up/1100-6535577/" data-ref-id="1100-6535577">they can turn on the player</a> if given a compelling reason to do so. The studio also unveiled a Moon Man plushie called a "Couch-Panion," which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-plushie-could-be-your-friend-or-kill-you-in-your-sleep/1100-6535451/" data-ref-id="1100-6535451">is the prize for winning a contest</a> running through November 16.

However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/" data-ref-id="1900-6418428">GameSpot's review</a> gave The Outer Worlds 2 an 8/10 score and said that it "feels like the series [is] coming into its own, carried by flexible combat options and great role-playing progression."</p><p>Per the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">launch times</a>, early-access players will get to play The Outer Worlds 2 on October 24. Everyone else will have to wait until October 29 to play it on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. This title will also be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release.</p>

                <p>Anyone looking to return to the Olympic Exclusion Zone in the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pacific-drive/">Pacific Drive</a> story DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-2024s-best-games-is-getting-a-huge-horror-expansion/1100-6534553/">Whispers in the Woods</a>, are in for a surprise, as the expansion is out right now. In a surprise announcement, developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive revealed that Whispers in the Woods is now available, and the game has also been ported over to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p>The expansion features a brand-new story and content that Ironwood Studios says is roughly a third of the size of the base game, and it includes new anomalies and horrors to discover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXRk1pFRgOc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cXRk1pFRgOc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also experiment with several new gameplay systems, such as the Whispering Tide. This is described as a "mysterious force that grows more perilous" the longer you linger in the Whispering Woods, and to survive, you'll need to equip specially attuned parts to your station wagon that can keep it at bay. Artifacts from Altars will also be found in the expansion, and these offer reality-warping powers that affect both the environment and you.</p><p>Pacific Drive made a lasting impression when it debuted last year, as the Indie survival game blended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">well-crafted layer of suspense with a surprisingly chill vibe</a> as you explored a creepy patch of the Pacific Northwest from the relative safety of your station wagon.</p><p>"With its wonderful depth in both story and gameplay, Pacific Drive is an early hit in 2024," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pacific-drive-review-road-trippy/1900-6418183/">Pacific Drive review</a>. "It sets out to create a world that fits comfortably in the New Weird genre but brings its own style and substance to it. Though the game can be especially hard to decipher, difficulty options help to counter some of its more overwhelming aspects. I'll stick to bikes in my day-to-day life through the actual northwest, but in Pacific Drive, I'm up for another joy ride through one hell of a winding road."</p>
