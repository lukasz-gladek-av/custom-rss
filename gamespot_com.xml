                <p>In a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-563578">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> showcase, Gameloft has shared new info on the cozy game's upcoming Wishblossom Ranch expansion, which introduces a selection of new characters, biomes, and gameplay features when it launches on November 19. Oh, and there are a <em>lot</em> of horses.</p><p>Today's Disney Dreamlight Valley showcase gave players a glimpse at the story they can expect to experience in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, revealing that Cruella de Vil has taken control of the ranch and brought it to ruins with her villainy. At the same time, a giant flower beneath Wishblossom Ranch has been disturbed, causing wish magic to run rampant through the biomes. This expansion's tale will revolve around solving the mystery of the wish magic, as well as finding all of the missing horses that once inhabited the ranch and rebuilding it to its former glory.</p><p>Cruella de Vil isn't the only new villager coming in the expansion, though, as players will also get to befriend Tigger, Snow White, and Tinkerbell. They'll encounter these beloved Disney characters while exploring the expansion's new biome: the snow-covered Wishing Alps, Cruella-inspired Glamour Gulch, and oversized fauna-filled Pixie Acres. And as usual, each of these biomes features new critters to meet and feed, including geese, skunks, and adorable little bees.</p><p>Speaking of horses, Gameloft has confirmed that these majestic creatures will play a huge part in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, both in terms of story progression and as rideable mounts. In addition to working with and riding horses from Disney films--such as Tangled, Mulan, and Hercules--you'll even be able to customize horses with a wide variety of flairs to make them uniquely your own.</p><p>The horse-related elements aren't exclusively about customization and leisurely rides, though. Horses also bring new ways to work around the valley, as they allow you to run through Night Thorns, Splinters of Fate, Inkies, and brand-new Dead Wish Blossoms to clear them away. And your horse can even stomp the ground to dig holes, hold a watering can to water your crops, and kick mining nodes to help you collect gems.</p><p>The good news doesn't stop at having a helping hand (hoof?) around the valley, either. Unlike previous expansions, which were split into multiple parts that released over the course of a year, Wishblossom Ranch will release all of its content on day one. This means all four villagers and the full story will be available right away, incentivizing players to get to work rebuilding Wishblossom Ranch at their own pace.</p><p>For existing players, the standard version of the Wishblossom Ranch expansion will come with 5,000 moonstones--the game's premium currency--while the Deluxe Edition will come with 10,000 moonstones, the Arendellian Riding Outfit and Snowy Alpine House Style cosmetic items, and an exclusive Sven mount from the film Frozen. And yes, Sven is rideable!</p><p>Meanwhile, new players can purchase a Wishblossom Ranch Edition of Disney Dreamlight Valley that comes with the base game and the expansion, or opt for the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, Wishblossom Ranch with all Deluxe Edition bonuses, and all previous expansions.</p><p>Lastly, anyone who purchases any version of Wishblossom Ranch between November 19 and December 3 will receive the Springtime Festival Outfit and Festival Tack cosmetic items for free.</p><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley's Wishblossom Ranch expansion launches November 19 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC. We've also learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-teases-cinderella-new-dreamteam-multiplayer-feature-and-2026-updates/1100-6535429/" data-ref-id="1100-6535429">Cinderella is coming to DDV</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> has long been one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">best horror games</a> to play, but in its next update, it's going to get even scarier. Coming in a patch on October 21, Invasion mode is adding an optional PvP mode to the game for the first time, and the way developer Red Barrels has designed it adds a ton of horror and paranoia to the experience.</p><p>As devoted players already know, the normally PvE co-op horror game can be disrupted by "impostors," NPC characters who appear on the map as violent doppelgangers. These impostors are caught somewhat easily by their tell-tale laughs--they don't easily fool experienced players, though their behaviors have grown more sophisticated since the game first launched. But Invasion mode is about to overhaul that element in a major way.</p><p>During Invasion rounds, an enemy team of up to four players can join a game as impostors, taking turns infiltrating the round while disguised as players on the other team and armed with a kitchen knife. When waiting to spawn in, impostors can spy on the other team using security cameras, while those players can break the cameras as a counter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339" data-ratio="0.55786163522013" data-width="1590" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339"></a><figcaption>Invasion mode brings even more paranoia to a game that already loves toying with players' sense of safety.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png"></figure><p>It's the goal of the impostor team to sabotage the mission for the other side. Gone are the impostors' signature laughs that would give away the ruse, and impostors can even unlock a number of unique skills that will help them move faster, blend in better, and kill more efficiently. In the final moments of a round, all impostors are released onto the map, adding a final touch of chaos. In an added bit of fun, impostors can hear a moment of their victim's voice comms just before they kill them off, too.</p><p>I recently played a live preview of the mode and it was the scariest thing I've experienced in the game to date. At the same time, it was hilarious, in that "I'm so nervous, I'm laughing" sort of way. Each round of Invasion becomes fully enveloped in an air of paranoia. Even just working with another player on your team becomes an unnerving exercise. I didn't feel safe turning my back to my allies, because they may have been killers only wearing their face.</p><p>The mode looks like it'll be a hit for the horror game, and it comes alongside a bigger update that also adds an in-game shop, new missions, and the annual Halloween event, Geister. Twitch Drops are coming for the first time, too. All of these things come bundled in the October 21 game patch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Nearly two years ago, Rockstar Games shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, one of the most highly anticipated titles in the history of the video game industry. Since then, numerous analysts and gaming industry figures have speculated or openly wished for the game to be sold for $100 in order for other AAA games to reach the same price. Now, Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has shared his wish for GTA 6 to be $100 as well, but not for the same reason as some of his peers.</p><p>"They're the only ones that can get away with it," said Stockman during an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Esports Insider</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "I don't think it's a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that [there will] be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100. The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</p><p>Earlier this year, Wedbush Securities argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">selling GTA 6 at $100 could benefit players</a> by giving them a massive amount of in-game currency for GTA Online. Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott disagreed and said it was a bad idea because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise. Elliott also cited the rising cost of living as a primary reason not to charge players a higher price than the industry standard. Most of the newer AAA games are now going for $70.</p><p>Take-Two was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-defends-nba-2k21s-price-increase/1100-6482168/" data-ref-id="1100-6482168">among the first publishers to raise its prices from $60 to $70 back in 2020</a>. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">non-committal about raising prices</a> again during an investor call in August.</p><p>"We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing," said Zelnick. "So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

The first mainline Ninja Gaiden in many years, this new entry in the series has been co-developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, and it officially launches on October 21. Global launch times for Ninja Gaiden 4 have been officially confirmed, and if you're in the US, you won't have to worry too much about FOMO during working hours because the game will go live toward the later part of the day on October 20.</p><p>For the middle part of the world, those times translate to a <em>very </em>early launch on October 21, so if you're in London or Paris, at least you can wake up and start playing right away if you preloaded the game. Here's a quick breakdown of the exact Ninja Gaiden 4 launch times across the globe. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adding-these-12-games-soon/2900-7116/" data-ref-id="2900-7116">Ninja Gaiden 4 will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 release times</h2><h3>Monday, October 20, 2025</h3><ul><li>5 PM PT</li><li>6 PM CST</li><li>8 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CST</li></ul><h3>Tuesday, October 21, 2025</h3><ul><li>1 AM BST</li><li>2 AM CEST</li><li>9 AM KST</li><li>9 AM JST</li><li>11 AM AEDT</li><li>1 PM NZDT</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662"></a><figcaption>Ninja Gaiden 4 global release times</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg"></figure><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 preloading times and install sizes</h2><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 should be a relatively quick download--depending on your home internet connection--as sizes range from 36.82GB on Xbox Series X|S consoles to 54.9GB on PC. PS5 users can expect the smallest download here, as the game clocks in at 23.55GB in size. These are just the install sizes, and they're likely to change with any potential updates or future patches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4 preorders are still live</a> and come with several bonuses.</p><p>Following the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 follows Ryu Hayabusa and a new protagonist, Yakumo, as they explore the underworld of Tokyo. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers," Jessica Cogswell wrote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-is-the-ninja-gaiden-game-youre-hoping-it-will-be/1100-6533763/">in her preview of the game</a>. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be."</p><p>While the series has a reputation for being challenging, this new entry in the franchise looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-could-be-the-easiest-or-toughest-game-in-the-series-to-date/1100-6535013/">it could be the most approachable yet</a> thanks to several accessibility options. If you're looking to breeze through the storyline and feel like a master ninja, you can tone down the difficulty for your playthrough, or if you're feeling masochistic, you can dial it up to a sadistic level that's designed to feel purposefully unfair.</p>

                <p>Late last month, Electronic Arts confirmed that it had struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">a $55 billion deal</a> to go private under new ownership including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There are a lot of unanswered questions about what this means for EA and the industry at large, but now two US Senators are raising the potential "foreign influence" Saudi Arabia could enact with EA under its control.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren--both of whom are Democrats--co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about whether Saudi Arabia will take over EA's editorial independence if the deal is approved. As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/senators-warn-saudi-arabias-acquisition-of-ea-will-be-used-for-foreign-influence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, they also suggested that Saudi Arabia's ownership may rise to the level of a "national security" risk.</p><p>"The deal's potential to expand and strengthen Saudi foreign influence in the United States is compounded by the national security risks raised by the Saudi government's access to and unchecked influence over the sensitive personal information collected from EA's millions of users, its development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the company's product design and direction."</p><p>Saudi Arabia's PIF has spent a lot of money to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">invest in multiple video game companies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/" data-ref-id="1100-6511622">including Nintendo</a>. The country also struck a 12-year pact with the IOC to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a> for multiple events. Saudi Arabia has been accused of numerous human rights violations as well as the 2018 assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Investing in video game companies and other diversified holdings has been interpreted as a way for the country to whitewash its image on the international stage.</p>
