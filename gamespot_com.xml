                <p>The time of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo: Infinite</a> is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yT_lkR3V4-0?si=8JYCsywDbhhGSiTp" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In a message posted to <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Halo site</a>, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on "multiple Halo titles in development." This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">saying for over a year now</a> that there are multiple new Halo games in development.</p><p>"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us," reads the statement. "While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned."</p><p>The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the original Halo that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">bring the franchise to PlayStation 5</a> for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">a live-service Halo game</a>, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmo-was-killed-to-protect-execs-stock-bonus-developer-claims/1100-6535871/" data-ref-id="1100-6535871">some light on the Halo MMO</a> from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.</p><p>Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">handle 70% of its game QA and debugging</a>. The company went on to note that it wants to "establish a competitive advantage in game development." However, Michael Douse--the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian--has called out Square Enix and described its plan as "stupid."</p><p>"So QA are some of the most video games engaged people in any company," Douse wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986535697809854640" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>. "They are integral to your community teams. To publishing. They give you the real feedback. They know what is good and what is bad before the audience does, and they are the most resilient department."</p><p>"[The] idea that QA people can be replaced at a large scale is stupid because it supposes that the conversations with them can be replaced and they can't," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1986536143953781040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added Douse</a>. "They are a massively advantageous vibe check."</p><p>Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry. He cautions that losing QA workers risks missing out on future designers and other positions.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986537291645374734" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">QA is not an inherently entry-level job but I will also add that without gateways to the industry you won't find your lead designers. This is a stupid path. You want to be able to offer people beneficial positions that allow them to grow and help to grow you!</p>  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986537291645374734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a subsequent post, Douse noted that <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix aims to save $19.6 million</a> by outsourcing its QA to AI. He also questioned why executives weren't laid off if the company needs the savings so badly.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The desired annual savings of $19.6 million - while a substantial amount of money in real life terms - is not hugely substantial for a AAA company. If things are this bad where are the executive "layoffs?" I'm pretty sure these games aren't failing because of QA, publishing, etc. <a href="https://t.co/MCJw16kBHz" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/MCJw16kBHz</a></p>  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1986860278282109024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Reports have emerged that Square Enix is already conducting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reportedly-conducting-mass-layoffs/1100-6536007/" data-ref-id="1100-6536007">a massive employee layoff</a>. Square Enix isn't the only video game company to embrace AI. Electronic Arts has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>." A recent survey also found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI</a> in some way. Prominent game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation.</p>
