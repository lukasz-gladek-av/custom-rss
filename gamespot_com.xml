                <p>Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene--the creator of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a>--has been working on his new open-world survival game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/" data-ref-id="5000-505925">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, for the better part of the last four years. Now, Prologue: Go Wayback! is officially entering early access today and giving players a chance to brave the elements from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdm77g5F2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLdm77g5F2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prologue unfolds from a first-person perspective and drops players into a landscape that changes in every playthrough thanks to procedurally-generated maps. Even the weather can dramatically change, which forces you to make choices about how you're going to survive. Thirst, hunger, and body temperature all need to be maintained long enough for you to reach a weather tower. There are always multiple approaches for that goal, and plenty of ways to die if you make the wrong move.</p><p>As part of the launch, PlayerUnknown Productions is introducing a handful of features. Players will be able to customize the weather, the temperature, and the time of day at the beginning of each playthrough, which can make the experience easier or harder.</p><p>The standard mode is called Go Wayback!, but there's an even more difficult option called Objective: Survive. In the latter, you'll have limited resources to fall back on. Users who just want to explore can try the Free Roam mode, which lets up on the survival aspect of the game. But you can still manage to die if you fall from a great height.</p><p>One of the most intriguing new features is the map editor, which will let you import an image into the in-game map and use it to create a customized world. Alternatively, you can design your own maps.</p><p>Future early-access updates are planned that will introduce more dynamic weather patterns, the ability to craft objects with the available materials, climbing gear, and items of clothing that can degrade or tear if players don't repair them.</p><p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is now available for $20 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-0261c6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios has made a key change to Battlefield 6's Conquest mode which the developer <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991482335527657827" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">says</a> should help matches run longer, but in a good way.</p><p>As of today, November 20, Conquest matches now have an increased number of tickets--up from 1,000 to 1,200. The developer said it arrived at this change after watching feedback generally, along with "win rates, balance, the impact of objective play, and more."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">1.1.2.0 update</a> made changes to help push players to play the objective, and this has been working out so far, with more come-from-behind victories, among other positive results. However, these changes also led to matches ending "sooner than intended," and to address this, Battlefield Studios is increasing the number of tickets. The developer said this should help with match length and retain the focus on playing the objective.</p><p>"We believe that focusing on objective play is deep in the DNA of Battlefield and now more than ever, playing the objective and working with your squad and being a cohesive team overall will secure your team the victory," the developer explained.</p><p>The 1.1.2.0 update for Battlefield 6 also made a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">major change to aim-assist</a>, reverting the system to be what it was during the open beta. In other news, Battlefield 6's newest season continues to unfold with the debut of a new map, Eastwood, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-california-resistance-event-pass-all-free-and-paid-rewards-to-unlock/2900-7264/" data-ref-id="2900-7264">many more microtransactions.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website</a> states that the game is the "best-selling shooter game of the year," but the company has not provided any sourcing or data to back this up.</p>
