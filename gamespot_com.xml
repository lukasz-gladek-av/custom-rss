                <p>The makers of an upcoming spaceship co-op title are making a slight change of course: The game formerly known as Jump Ship has been renamed to Jump Space.</p><p>Development studio Keepsake Games announced the name change in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a>, assuring readers that the rebranding does not affect the game's release plans, and adding that a date announcement for its early access launch is coming this month at Gamescom. The title's Steam listing currently displays a release window of Q3 2025.</p><p>The studio, which was formed by veterans from Mojang, Hazelight Studios, and Coffee Stain Studios, stated that the new name is the result of "trademark complications." Keepsake's post does not go into detail about the complications. "Jump ship" is a fairly common idiom, but any company or product sharing the name could be the reason for a trademark dispute.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">ðŸš¨IMPORTANT NEWS!ðŸš¨<br>We're renaming to Jump Space, due to trademark complications.<br>This does not affect our release plans -<br>In fact, RELEASE DATE REVEAL at Gamescom later this August! <a href="https://t.co/x2iouYlvmV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/x2iouYlvmV</a></p>  â€” Jump Space - formerly Jump Ship (@KeepsakeGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Keepsake expressed excitement for the name change. "We think Jump Space is super cool, after all, there is more to the game than just the Ship," the Steam post continues. Funnily enough, this isn't the first name change for the game, as it previously<a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1663878368696193031" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> went by the codename Hyperspace</a> before a formal reveal as Jump Ship in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-looks-like-ftl-combined-with-sea-of-thieves/1100-6522368/" data-ref-id="1100-6522368">Jump Space has four players</a> act as crew members on a spacefaring craft, taking on several "hand crafted missions with random elements." Players will switch between operating and maintaining the ship, space walking, and exploring planets on foot.</p><p>Common points of comparison to Jump Space include Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, and it joins the budding "space Sea of Thieves-like" subgenre alongside Void Crew and Wildgate. However, Jump Space is purely a PvE experience, bringing it closer to Void Crew and less like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-space-pvp-game-wildgate-will-be-supported-after-launch/1100-6533150/" data-ref-id="1100-6533150">PvP-focused Wildgate</a>.</p><p>According to Keepsake Games, over 1 million people have added Jump Space to their Steam wishlist. The game is running a closed beta, and a free demo was available for a limited time this past June as a part of Steam Next Fest. Keepsake says that the Next Fest demo reached over 500,000 players.</p>

                <p>Introduced in Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_Portal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portal</a> is a mode that allows players to create custom game modes, and for Battlefield 6, it's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609"> getting a big overhaul</a>. UX director Alan Pimm said in a new interview that Battlefield Studios is putting a lot of investment into Portal for this year's game in part because fans want a game they can keep playing over and over again and finding new things along the way.</p><p>"People don't just want a game that they can complete," Pimm told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. "They want one that they can grow, that they can evolve, or they can make their dreams come true."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CHDiFW0wA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Portal is similar to Fortnite's Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Halo's Forge. For Battlefield 6, the developer is expanding what's possible and allowing users to create entire maps, and these maps and modes will provide XP like you'd get in the official playlists. However, anyone hoping to create a map with an XP exploit shouldn't expect that to work. The Portal mode will displays warnings within the editor to alert creators about whether or not their creation will allow for genuine XP gain or not.</p><p>Pimm said Battlefield 6's Portal mode was designed to help players "have a good time" and find something they want to play, even if it wasn't made by Battlefield Studios itself.</p><p>"[We want to] listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible," Pimm said.</p><p>During the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal event, the developers showed off a brief look at what's possible with the new version of Portal. In one sequence, we see something that looks like it's out of GTA Online, with a player piloting a jet through a floating ring of tanks high above the ground. This was just one example of the totally out-there types of game modes that players will be able to create.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/" data-ref-id="1100-6533674">server browser</a> so players can find the maps and modes they're looking for.</p><p>During EA's latest financial briefing, CEO Andrew Wilson called out user-generated content as one of the ways the company is seeking to <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Prepared-Remarks.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"unlock the full potential of our strategy."</a></p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta begins August 7 for a limited group of players before expanding more widely later in the month. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-is-available-to-download-now-as-preloading-and-file-sizes-go-live/1100-6533668/" data-ref-id="1100-6533668">Preloading is available now</a> on all platforms, and you can find out more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta guide.</a> The full game launches October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shared more details on its upcoming expansion to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" data-ref-id="5000-538660">Kirby and the Forgotten World</a>, and it's looking like a great time for Kirby fans when it releases later this month.</p><p>Eager to win an award for the longest game name, Nintendo's upcoming Kirby and the Forgotten World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed Worlds will serve as both an upgrade and expansion to Kirby's 2022 platforming adventure. The Switch 2 version of the game will feature improved visuals and performance alongside a breadth of new levels and features.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3bJ8tGrj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2h3bJ8tGrj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Star-Crossed World DLC, Kirby will set off to find star fragments--which are aptly-named Starries--and use them to seal away an evil presence brought upon The Forgotten Land by a fallen meteor. The meteor's impact has transformed levels throughout The Forgotten Land to create Starry Stages, which players will need to explore thoroughly to find previously inaccessible areas if they want to find all of the Starries.</p><p>In addition to new stages, Star-Crossed Worlds will also introduce three new Mouthful modes. With these all-new additions, Kirby will be able to swallow and transform into Spring Mouth to jump higher than ever, Gear Mouth to climb walls, and Sign Mouth to slide down slopes.</p><p>Players who enjoy going all-in on collectibles will also be able to find Starry Coins scattered throughout the new levels that can be used to purchase new figures to add to Kirby's ever-growing collection from the base game. Meanwhile, there's even a new challenge to be found at the Colosseum in Waddle Dee Town, offering what are likely to be the most difficult fights yet.</p><p>If you already own Kirby and the Forgotten Land, you can purchase an upgrade pack containing the Nintendo Switch 2 improvements and Star-Crossed World add-on for $20. Alternatively, the base game and upgrade pack are available combined for $80.</p>
