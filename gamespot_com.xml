                <p dir="ltr">Forza Horizon 6 hasn't even been officially announced by Microsoft, and yet, a possible leak might have revealed the racing game's setting: Japan. An Australian car import company reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/a/s8U6ckB" rel="nofollow ">posted and then deleted an image</a> on Instagram that showed a developer scanning Japanese kei cars.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://cultandclassic.com.au/" rel="nofollow ">Cult and Classic</a> post was spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" rel="nofollow ">the subreddit Gaming Leaks and Rumours</a>, with Forza Horizon fans extrapolating that the Japanese kei cars (which aren't found in America) strongly hint at Japan for the game's setting. However, there are a couple of reasons this theory could be misguided. For instance, Forza Horizon developer Playground Games is based in the United Kingdom, so cars not being available in the US has no bearing on scanning for the team. Additionally, why wouldn't the dev member just fly out to Japan instead of Australia to scan a kei car, which roughly translates to light vehicle?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s whopping open beta has now come and gone, and Battlefield Studios is addressing the feedback it has received, chiefly as it pertains to the game's bigger maps and criticism of player counts across its modes.</p><p>One of the main concerns for players coming out of the beta was the status of Battlefield 6's larger maps. The biggest one in the beta, Liberation Peak, was popular enough with players who craved the classic large-scale warfare of the series--even if it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">far too many snipers</a>--but many were left wanting more. This feeling was only exacerbated by the beta's apparent focus on smaller maps and modes, like Breakthrough and Rush on infantry-focused arenas like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and eventually, Empire State.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to players starved for bigger maps, which have already been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/much-larger-battlefield-6-maps-revealed-in-datamine-including-new-vehicles/1100-6534039/" data-ref-id="1100-6534039">revealed by dataminers</a>, Battlefield Studios has assured the community that "larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package," and they're on the way. The post elaborates that two of the game's significantly larger maps, one set in Mirak Valley and the other a remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm, will be included in the next phase of Battlefield Labs testing, which is set to continue leading up to Battlefield 6's launch on October 10.</p><p>Fans of Battlefield have come to expect certain things of the games, and one of those core tenets is greater player counts than the average multiplayer FPS title. However, a great deal of these players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">let down</a> when the fan-favorite mode Rush was introduced in the second weekend of the beta with a significantly smaller lobby size than usual, supporting up to 24 players in tight 12v12 matches.</p><p>Rush typically tasks teams with defending and attacking pairs of bomb sites at a time and has supported bigger lobbies in past games, which is what has wrinkled fans of the mode about its implementation in the latest game. It and the 64-player Conquest modes are often looked to as the signature modes of the Battlefield series and emblematic of its emphasis on big battles, so any significant change to it was bound to cause a stir. Battlefield Studios hears the concern from players, but also thinks that this downsizing might be the best move for Rush right now, and that it is in line with what it calls "the golden era" of the mode.</p><p>The team shared, "When it comes to Rush, the conversation we observed wasn't just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer. Rush is a mode with deep roots, originally known as Gold Rush in [Battlefield] Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. Many of you remember this as the golden era of Rush, and it continues to inspire our approach today."</p><p>It then goes on to say that despite toying with bigger lobby sizes in the past, these inflated player counts often led to issues that are streamlined or eliminated outright by cutting back and emphasizing smaller-team tactics. Due to that, the team is sticking with its lowered default player count for Rush, but encourages players wanting large-scale Rush to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">Portal</a>, Battlefield's custom matchmaking and level-building mode.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post goes into more detail about overall beta numbers. As folks may have gathered from the queues, livestreams, videos, and posts on social media, Battlefield 6's open beta was a knockout for EA. According to a graphic released by the team, there were roughly 420 million matches played over the course of the two beta weekends, totaling about 92 million hours of play. Players racked up more than 4.9 billion kills, knocked nearly 4 million jets out of the sky (I was at least half a dozen of those), and did 196 billion dollars in property damage.</p><p>Battlefield 6 releases on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Digital Eclipse has officially confirmed two more games for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, as the infamous PlayStation-era spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces are being added to the compilation. These titles have been unavailable for decades on PC and newer consoles, and Digital Eclipse added that they're being enhanced alongside the other Mortal Kombat games in the roster.</p><p>The studio says that there will be a rewind feature to make gameplay more forgiving, on-screen move lists, and a Trainer Mode to help players learn various combos and fatalities. Players can also expect reduced load times in each game.</p><p>The other big reveal from the studio was that the WaveNet edition of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 will also be included in the collection. This was originally developed to support Midway's ambitious WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcade machines, and it was the only Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature Noob Saibot as a playable character.</p><p>If you want an idea of just how big of a deal it is to have this version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 included, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/osu16bit.bsky.social/post/3lwwbjk72w22d" rel="nofollow ">NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback has a detailed thread</a> on just how ahead of its time the technology was, the significant gameplay changes that were made for this edition, and how this version of the game was thought to be lost to time before a working arcade cabinet was found.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89KZUGXbqY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you never played Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero or Mortal Kombat Special Forces, then you missed out on two <em>interesting </em>games. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997, and it was a sidescrolling action game that still retained the combat from the 2D Mortal Kombat games. A sound idea in theory, but in practice, the unforgiving platform sections and brutally difficult traps-- combined with sluggish controls--made it a chore to play. If you could look past those flaws, the game did have an interesting skill-tree system and live-action cinematics that rivaled the 1995 film in the cheese department.</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces hit the scene in 2000, and it had a rocky development. Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias and several other staff members left Midway before the game was finished, leading to content being cut and plans for Sonya Blade to feature as a playable character to be scrapped. The game isn't fondly remembered, but it's still an interesting part of Mortal Kombat history that Digital Eclipse is preserving for a new generation of players.</p><p>If you're looking to grab it, you can p<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-preorder-guide/1100-6533623/" data-ref-id="1100-6533623">reorder the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection right now</a>. With those two entries confirmed, the full list of playable games includes:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat -- 1992 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 2 -- 1993 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis)</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, WaveNet Arcade, SNES)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy -- 1996 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 -- 1997 (Arcade)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero -- 1997 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces -- 2000 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance -- 2001 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance -- 2002 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition -- 2003 (Game Boy Advance)</li></ul><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection launches on December 12 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch 2, and Switch.

                <p dir="ltr">When you first boot up Okomotive's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">Herdling</a>, it may seem like the mystical vistas you encounter are something out of fantasy. But that’s not the case. The development team drew inspiration from hikes they took while creating the game.</p><p dir="ltr">“We went on a few hikes in the Swiss mountains, before and while developing Herdling," Herdling creative director Don Schmocker tells GameSpot via email. "From Medels to the Suretta Lakes, three picturesque mountain lakes located close to the Swiss and Italian border, or up one of the better-known Swiss mountains, Mount Rigi. They were always inspiring and got us away from our computers for a bit."</p><p dir="ltr">Hikes along the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/grisons/splugen-surettaseen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Suretta Lakes</a> and up <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/lucerne/rigi-panorama-trail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mount Rigi</a> inspired Herdling, a magical adventure where players guide strange, mythical creatures across magical mountain landscapes. The team’s goal was to capture the feeling of wandering and exploring while herding--and to make it feel natural rather than mechanical.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984"></a><figcaption>The mountains may be the most realistic element of Herdling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">“When we decided to develop Herdling, we were intrigued by the fantasy of guiding strange animals through the mountains,” Schmocker added. “But we knew that the first thing we had to figure out was the original herding gameplay. We built several prototypes to try out different approaches. Some were more direct but felt too mechanical, and some were too unintuitive. Another problem we needed to solve was making the animals feel natural and animal-like, without interfering with players’ intentions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Okomotive eventually found a gameplay style that felt fluid and intuitive. To keep movement smooth, the team looked to games like The Pathless, Journey, and even racing games like SSX--making sure herding never felt like an escort mission or a puzzle.</p><p dir="ltr">The game’s visuals also mix fantastical and real-world influences. The Calicorn creatures are inspired by Bulgarian Kukeri costumes, while films like Pan’s Labyrinth, Spirited Away, and The Last Guardian informed the magical tone of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">“In the FAR games we use environmental storytelling to tell big stories about the world and past events,” Schmocker said. “In Herdling we tell a more personal story that’s centered around protagonist Via and the herd.”</p><p>The game can be completed in a few afternoons--roughly three to five hours--but you might take a little more time exploring its mix of mountain-inspired landscapes. The journey within Herdling resonated with GameSpot's Mark Delaney. He called it a game about finding one's purpose.</p><p>"It's a journey I'll remember for a long time thanks to its depiction of animals as unique individuals who, very much like us, are chiefly seeking love and safety," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">GameSpot review.</a> "It was one of my favorite experiences in video games to help them find that safety and to feel that love."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gibson added, "The most interesting thing now is that we can add to it next. We've got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."</p><p>Both Gibson and Pellen stop short of detailing the nature of these ambitions, but consider the Silksong carrot back at the end of the stick. You thought we were done just because we have a release date now?</p><p>It seems that much like Hollow Knight before it, Silksong will be a major focus of Team Cherry for a long time. Despite initially launching in the early months of 2017, Hollow Knight was followed up by four pieces of free DLC, all of which added significant content by way of additional interactions with characters, new quests, boss fights, and music, as well as optimizations and quality-of-life fixes.</p><p>News of Silksong DLC invites some speculation. Like, for example, should players expect a similar number of post-launch expansions as the first game? Considering the lengthy development period for it, is the development team likely to keep adding to Silksong rather than immediately moving to another game? Will Silksong's expansions also be released for free?</p><p>The most ironic piece of this news is, of course, that Silksong was planned as the fifth and final piece of DLC for Hollow Knight before it eventually ballooned into its own game. By 2019, it had transformed into a full-fledged sequel, and the rest, as you all likely know, is history.</p><p>Now though, at long last, Silksong is actually right around the corner. It is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">currently playable at Gamescom</a> and is now officially dated for September 4, which is just weeks away. Let's just hope that DLC doesn't take cues from the main game and take a lifetime to arrive.</p>
