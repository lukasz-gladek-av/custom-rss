                <p>Nintendo has just kicked off its Switch 2 era of gaming, but the company is also saying goodbye to its 3DS line of handheld gaming consoles. While Nintendo continued supporting the 3DS and its various models via a repair service in Japan, even after the systems were discontinued, Nintendo began to slowly wind down these operations over the years. The New Nintendo 2DS XL was the last console to be officially supported in this way, but the company has announced that this is coming to an end.</p><p>"As we have run out of parts needed for repairs, we have discontinued repair services for the New Nintendo 2DS XL as of September 4, 2025," Nintendo said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-ends-repair-support-for-new-2ds-xl-meaning-all-3ds-models-are-now-no-longer-supported/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Repairs for all other Nintendo 3DS series systems have also been discontinued."</p><p>This effectively brings the Nintendo 3DS era to a close, as Nintendo no longer has the parts necessary for it to perform repairs on units submitted to its Japanese facilities. The company ended support for the original 3DS handheld in August 2024, and it ran out of parts for the Nintendo 2DS not long after.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo closed the eShops for the 3DS and Wii U console back in 2023</a>, with repair support for the Wii U ending last year. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-is-the-last-week-your-3ds-and-wii-u-games-will-work-online/1100-6522326/">3DS doesn't have online-play functionality anymore either</a>, it's still home to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-3ds-games/2900-3935/">rich collection of games</a> that are available in a physical cartridge format.</p><p>The 3DS was a solid performer for Nintendo, as it went on to sell 75.9 million units worldwide during its run. The evolution of the best-selling Nintendo DS handheld offered an interesting 3D screen gimmick, but later models, renamed to 2DS, would drop this feature entirely. At one point, Nintendo even sold a 2DS that didn't have a clamshell design and was geared toward younger members of the family.</p><p>Meanwhile, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a solid start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/">Sales of the Switch 2 are outpacing sales of the original Switch in the US</a> by a wide margin, with 2 million units sold as of August 27. Globally, the Switch 2 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">more than 6 million units in the seven weeks after launch</a>, even with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/">relatively high price</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
