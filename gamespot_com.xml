                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline right now, but fortunately it's not because anything is wrong. Quite the opposite, in fact--Fortnite is down because of routine scheduled maintenance that Epic does with every update. In this case, the update is a big one: the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite battle royale Chapter 6 Season 2</a>, featuring major changes to the island, piles of new weapons and gadgets, and the arrival of Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Chapter 6 got off to quite a bang during Season 1, as Fortnite introduced the permanent OG mode with its own separate battle pass, and also the Counter-Strike-esque Ballistic mode. In January, the season ramped up once more with the addition of the player-controlled Godzilla boss and the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Festival. But all things must come to an end--we had our fun with the ridiculous Typhoon Blade, but now it's time to move on to less civilized weapons, like the big drill weapon we saw in the trailer.</p><h2><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 start time</strong></h2><p>When the servers come back up, it'll be Lawless season, which is all about committing armed robbery. That's right, it's Fortnite's fourth heist-themed season. But where the past seasons like this had more of a classy bent, Lawless season is going to be more in the vein of Grand Theft Auto--mayhem is the name of the game here.</p><p>Since we're already in downtime, the wait shouldn't be too long. Fortnite went offline at 2 AM ET/11 PM PT, and season updates typically take somewhere in the ballpark of 4-7 hours. If all goes well, you could be fragging away in Crime City by 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. But don't take that as a given--when Chapter 5 Season 2 launched a year ago, something went wrong, and Fortnite stayed offline until the evening. But that was a very unusual case. Most seasons launch between 4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET.</p><p>Every new battle royale season dramatically changes the gameplay meta, and Season 2 will not be an exception. This crime-fueled season will add a new urban location, Crime City, as well as a bundle of new tools, like timed explosives, sticky grenades, and a rocket drill, that will help you steal gold and whatever else you can find. For more on what you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">check out our rundown here</a>.</p>

                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from. Thus far, Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment haven't announced how many copies Avowed has sold since its release on February 18. The game received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-companions-wont-nag-you-as-much-about-getting-better-armor-after-day-one-patch/1100-6529570/" data-ref-id="1100-6529570">a day-one patch earlier this week</a> to address some of the issues found in it. The developers have previously explained why Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but fortunately there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>.</p><p>Avowed is available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, and subscribers to those services <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">have an option to upgrade to the premium version</a> at a greatly reduced cost.</p>

Players vie for the $38 million prize--metaphorically that is--by competing in up to six mini-games like Tug of War, Glass Bridge, Marbles, and Red Light/ Green Light. Designed for up to six people to play, the first person to reach the Squid Head will win big in this twisted take on survival of the fittest. Like the Squid Game TV series, surviving players will get to split the money earned up to that point, so it's in your best interest to keep your teammates alive so that you have a numerical edge over the opposing team.</p><p>Each session lasts around 45 minutes, so this is a nice way to enjoy a quick round of Squid Game and not worry about being possibly betrayed by a trusted friend. Each of the six games features unique playstyles and rulesets, so you'll want to adapt quickly if you want to avoid being eliminated.</p><p>In addition to the official board game, Netflix also collaborated with Spin Master Games on an official set of marbles.

                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games. There will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p>For years, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">has fought with Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">Google</a> in court for the right to expand the Epic Games Store on mobile. The company says that it grew Epic cross-platform accounts to 898 million users during 2024--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-store-sales-on-pc-reached-1-billion-in-2024/1100-6529505/" data-ref-id="1100-6529505">an increase of 94 million people</a>--and this stat includes accounts created through partner platforms and the Epic Games Store. Epic is following in the footsteps of its PC store by trying to attract users with free games.</p><p>Recently, two members of Epic's board of directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-justice-department-investigation-leads-to-board-members-leaving-epic-games/1100-6528567/" data-ref-id="1100-6528567">were forced to step down</a> by the US Justice Department because they were already members of Tencent's board, which the government considers a rival gaming company. Epic is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">suing an alleged cheater</a> whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments.</p>
