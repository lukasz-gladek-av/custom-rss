                <p>In 2014, Machine Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review/1900-6415765/" data-ref-id="1900-6415765">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> rebooted the classic Wolfenstein shooter from id Software. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review/1900-6416796/" data-ref-id="1900-6416796">Wolfenstein: The New Colossus</a>, followed in 2017, with a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-youngblood-nintendo-switch-review/1900-6417260/" data-ref-id="1900-6417260">Wolfenstein: Youngblood</a> in 2019.

Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," said Torvenius during a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While there's currently no word about a third Wolfenstein game, Amazon is reportedly developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">a Wolfenstein TV series for Prime Video</a>. Kilter Films--one of the production companies behind Prime Video's Fallout series--is producing the show alongside Machine Games. Plot details are currently undisclosed, but it's believed to be based on the reboot's storyline.</p><p>Machine Games is now owned by Microsoft as part of the ZeniMax acquisition. The studio's most recent title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which continued Wolfenstein's Nazi-fighting tradition.

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax. Hines is now retired, but he's continued to share his opinions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">how he feels about Xbox Game Pass. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Battlefield 2042’s recently released “Road to Battlefield 6” battle pass has proven to be a popular addition. Given it offers multiple cosmetic items for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, a boost in active players makes sense. And with a more active community now playing the game, EA has announced that a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1965067993185972329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">small hotfix update</a> is coming tomorrow, September 9.</p><p>The main issue seemed to be based on progression. Some of the weekly missions involving the M1 Garand, for instance, weren’t tracking correctly in All Out Warfare. Some players also felt that the grind to unlock the free cosmetics was a bit much. This has led to a Tier Skip function--a feature that, depending on who you’re talking to, presents its own set of issues--allowing players to pay to advance through the ranks. The hotfix also addresses some weapon/gadget balancing, fixed a Playercard issue, and updated the Team Deathmatch playlist.</p>

The game has sold millions of copies, with fans praising the sequel for its no-nonsense gameplay, satisfying action, and impressive graphics. "Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/">Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's review</a>.</p><p>Since launch, developer Saber Interactive has frequently updated the game with patches and new content, like the addition of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/">new Horde mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-just-became-a-whole-lot-more-modder-friendly/1100-6531452/">better mod support</a>. One of the big things coming next year is the Techmarine, Space Marine 2's seventh playable class. Details on it remain vague for now, but we do know that Techmarines can wield their own exclusive weapon, the Omnissiah Axe.</p><p>If you're looking to grab a few more preorders, there's a lot to check out right now. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-preorder-collectors-edition-playstation-5-amazon-walmart-target/1100-6531054/" data-ref-id="1100-6531054">Ghost of Yotei</a> slashes its way onto PS5 in October alongside some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-console-bundles-and-dualsense-are-up-for-preorder/1100-6534326/" data-ref-id="1100-6534326">very stylish limited-edition PS5 consoles and controllers</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">Battlefield 6</a> also launches in October and will be followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preoders-live-includes-cross-gen-and-early-beta-access/1100-6534093/" data-ref-id="1100-6534093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in November.

The feature was first added in Battlefield 1 and its sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-v/" data-ref-id="5000-482208">Battlefield V</a>, but was not included in 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the video clip, Ter-Lee-Comedy also posted a before-and-after comparison screenshot of a pristine weapon as shown in the Battlefield 6 open beta compared to one covered in grime from a more recent playtest.</p><p dir="ltr">The difference is substantial, with the dirt-covered weapon looking to be caked in mud. While the buildup of mud and dirt on weapons is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay, it's still a popular visual feature that many players have said help battles feel more immersive. However, it's worth nothing that just because the feature is in a playtest doesn't guarantee it will be in Battlefield 6 at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the greater destructibility of Battlefield 6's buildings and environments (something that players found lacking in Battlefield 2042), the latest installment of the franchise looks to be bringing back what fans loved from past Battlefield games.
