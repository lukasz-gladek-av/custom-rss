                <p>Microsoft has embarked on a new multiplatform direction for several of its Xbox games, and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden believes that this new initiative could work in the company's favor if handled correctly--much like it has for Sega. Layden believes that Microsoft can benefit from having a wider market to sell its games to as part of its new multiplatform strategy, but the downside to this is that it could possibly make it harder for the company to attract more people to its platform.</p><p>"Multiplatform is a strategy, particularly in a world where the cost of development is increasing dramatically," Layden said to YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/UAcM-xmUegs?t=2968" rel="nofollow ">Kiwi Talks</a>. "Multiplatform means widening your addressable market, as the marketing guys say. How do you create the fear of missing out, trying to do that by bringing everyone to your platform? Saying, 'If you're not here you're missing out,' but if it's available on all platforms, that's one of your marketing tactics. You can't say it's only available here if it's available everywhere. So it's a balancing act, right? I'm increasing my addressable market, that's good. I'm making it harder to sell only on my platform."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAcM-xmUegs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2968">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UAcM-xmUegs?start=2968" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Layden noted, there was precedent for this shift in business tactics, as following the launch and poor sales of the Dreamcast, Sega dropped out of the console hardware race to focus on developing and publishing video games. "We've seen it before. I mean I was in the business when Sega brought their Dreamcast titles to PlayStation 2. And in time, Sega became a software-only company and have been a great transformation in that respect," Layden said.</p><p>Microsoft has two big games on the way to PS5 consoles this year. Last year it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-whips-up-4-million-players-before-ps5-debut/1100-6529145/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would reach that platform</a> several months after its Xbox and PC launch, and last week, the company revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5 will also race onto PS5 in spring</a>.</p><p>In terms of hardware, Xbox Series X|S sales are reportedly behind the Xbox One at the same point in both of their lifecycles, while the PS5 is outpacing the PS4. The good news for Microsoft is that its multiplatform approach appears to be paying off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-xboxs-struggles-in-hardware-microsoft-was-reportedly-the-top-video-game-publisher-in-december/1100-6529088/">as it was apparently the number-one video game publisher in December 2024</a> thanks partly to its Call of Duty games.</p>

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization is known for being one of the most brutal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">strategy games</a> you can play at the highest difficulty level. Of course, if you're looking for a more laid-back experience or you're a new player, the franchise has always let you swap to a lower difficulty. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a> has brought back the difficulty levels and options from previous games, but they're not a copy-and-paste list of settings.</p><p>There are several difficulty levels, different map types and lengths, and other advanced settings that you'll want to know about before hopping into Civilization VII. The guide below explains how to change your difficulty level and everything about customizing your game.</p><h2>How to change difficulty in Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431083"></a><figcaption>The difficulty options in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png"></figure><p>First and foremost, let's go over how and where to change between the game's various difficulty levels. Unlike other games, this can't be done by going to the settings menu and flipping between the different levels. Instead, you have to start up a new game and go through a few menus before you're able to customize the difficulty level and other options in Civilization VII.</p><p>However, there's also a massive caveat with the difficulty level. In our version of the game on PC, <strong>we were</strong> <strong>not able to change the difficulty or set any other game options until after our first game was over</strong>. Once we beat one run, we could start a new game and access all the difficulty options. It's unclear if this is a bug or an intended feature.</p><p>To change the difficulty level, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Launch Civilization VII and press "New Game" from the main menu</li><li>Choose your desired Leader and Age and Civilization. It's highly recommended to always start from the Antiquity Age, as that's the formal beginning of the game.</li><li>Click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen to go to the "Confirm" tab</li><li>Here, you can access all the difficulty settings</li><li>The top option is your overall difficulty, and here are the different levels:  <ul><li>Scribe</li><li>Governor</li><li>Viceroy</li><li>Sovereign</li><li>Immortal</li><li>Deity</li></ul></li><li>The levels go from easiest to strongest, so for a standard playthrough, select either Governor or Viceroy</li><li>Once you're done with the difficulty level, you can customize the options below it before officially starting your game</li><li>Be warned, <strong>once you launch your game, you can't change the difficulty level</strong> or game options again unless you start a new save</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431084"></a><figcaption>The victory screen after winning a game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png"></figure><p>As we mentioned before, if you're loading up your first game of Civilization VII, the option to select your difficulty level might not be there. If what we experienced is intended, then it should take you roughly 10-15 hours of playtime to beat one run of the game on standard difficulty. After that point, you can make a new game and choose your difficulty options.</p><h2>All difficulty options in Civilization VII</h2><p>In addition to the difficulty levels in Civilization VII, you can also change a variety of game options. These include map type, game length, age length, and more. We'll go more in depth with each of those settings below:</p><p><strong>Game Speed </strong></p><ul><li>Online</li><li>Quick</li><li>Standard</li><li>Epic</li><li>Marathon</li></ul><p>This determines how long every game takes in turns and the number of overall turns per age. If you want a massive campaign that drags on for 30 hours, choose Marathon. However, most players will likely feel comfortable with Standard or Epic.</p><p><strong>Map Type </strong></p><ul><li>Continents Plus</li><li>Continents</li><li>Archipelago</li><li>Fractal</li><li>Shuffle</li><li>Terra Incognita</li></ul><p>Your map type is an important choice, as it controls what lands you'll be able to traverse. The standard option is Continents Plus, which gives you two continents to explore and some islands in between them. Continents takes out the islands while Archipelago makes it so your continents are broken up by islands. Fractal makes the continents more connected and offers less water between them. Then, Shuffle makes your map type random while Terra Incognita gives you one normal continent and a random second one.</p><p><strong>Map Size </strong></p><ul><li>Tiny</li><li>Small</li><li>Standard</li></ul><p>Finally, your map size determines the overall scale of the map you get to explore. Naturally, tiny and small sizes make for quicker games, as there's less to traverse and do. So, it's usually recommended for players to stick to the standard map size.</p><p><strong>Advanced Options </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431085"></a><figcaption>Advanced Options give you more difficulty choices</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png"></figure><ul><li>Age Length: Abbreviated, Standard, Long</li><li>Disaster Intensity: Light, Moderate, Catastrophic</li><li>Crises: Yes or No</li></ul><p>Advanced Options further customizes your game. The age length setting allows you to make your games shorter or longer depending on what game speed you set. Disasters and crises offer the chance to make things easier or harder on yourself. If you want a harder experience, turn crises on and pump disasters up to catastrophic level. However, neither of these settings will have too big of an effect on the difficulty unless you're playing on the higher difficulty levels.</p><p>You can also change the "Player Settings" within the Advanced Options menu. This allows you to set the world leaders you'll meet during a game and what civilizations they control. While this doesn't have a huge impact on difficulty, you can make your experience tougher by selecting leaders that are "militaristic." This makes them more prone to war, which is generally what difficulty levels are based on.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

                <p>Resources are what drive your individual settlements forward in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a>. Not only do they improve all of the pertinent stats your empire needs to sustain itself, but they also improve relations with neighboring leaders. The more resources your civilization has access to, the better off you'll be.</p><p>The best way to acquire resources outside your settlements owning resource tiles is by establishing trade routes. Trade routes can only be established by merchants, who are individual units you can produce or purchase in a city or town. However, the process of using your merchants is not as simple as it sounds in Civilization 7.</p><h2>How to get Merchants in Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432918" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432918"></a><figcaption>The message that grants you access to Merchants</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png"></figure><p>Merchants are one of the earlier units you can produce in Civilization VII. In our initial playthrough, we were first able to produce a merchant at the 50% mark of the Antiquity Age. You'll know you can start producing merchants when you see the first "Trade Opportunity" message appear during one of your turns. The message will state that a neighboring leader has abundant resources, and you should send a merchant to set up a trade route with them.</p><p>When you get this message, go to your capital city and scroll down the production units until you see "Merchant." The merchant takes roughly three or four turns to produce, but you can also purchase one for around 400 gold. Merchants can be produced in cities or bought in towns.</p><p>Once your merchant has been produced, you need to choose where they go to establish a trade route. By selecting the merchant during a turn, you'll see all the possible trade routes they can visit. These trade routes directly result from how many leaders you've met and all of their settlements you've discovered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432919"></a><figcaption>Producing a Merchant in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png"></figure><h2>How to establish Trade Routes in Civilization 7</h2><p>During your first turn with a merchant, select the settlement you want to set up a trade route with. You mainly want to look for what settlement has the most resources to offer, but you can also specialize your trade route if you're looking for one or two specific resources.</p><p>If you want to set up more possible trade routes, you need to discover more of the map and other leaders' settlements. The merchant also needs to be within a certain range of possible locations. With this in mind, it's wise to produce merchants at different settlements within your empire so you have a more extensive selection of places to go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432920"></a><figcaption>Your first look at the Merchant screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png"></figure><p>You can send multiple merchants to the same settlement to establish a trade route. However, this requires going to a leader's portrait page and spending Influence to set up additional trade routes. You can only do this with leaders who are friendly or neutral with you. Leaders who you're warring with or have a negative relationship with will generally reject any trade route proposals.</p><p>You can see the status of your relationship with a leader by going to their portrait and selecting the tab with a heart and number on it. If the number is green, you're in good standing with the leader, but the leader is hostile towards you if it's red.</p><p>Returning to setting up trade routes, once you have selected the settlement you want to visit, select it from the "Possible Trade Routes" menu. Then, your game will take you to that location on the map. From here, right-click on the capital of the settlement and you'll send your merchant off on their journey.</p><p>Depending on how far the settlement is from your merchant's starting location, they could take several turns to reach their destination. Don't worry, though, as the merchants are automated, so you don't have to control each turn individually.</p><p>When the merchant arrives at the settlement, they'll be given a turn, and you have to decide what to do with them. To establish a trade route with the settlement they're in, view their box in the bottom-right and press the icon with two arrows and a plus sign, as seen in the screenshot below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432914" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432914"></a><figcaption>Choosing to establish a trade route to another settlement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png"></figure><p>This establishes a trade route with the settlement, granting you the resources it offers. From there, your merchant will disappear and you can allocate your newfound resources to cities or towns. If you send your merchant to a city, the resources in return can only be allocated to one of your cities. However, merchants visiting a town will grant you bonus resources, which can be allocated to cities or towns in your empire.</p><p>Your other option with the merchant is to send them to another settlement. This forgoes the establishment of a trade route. Generally, you want to ensure you're always establishing a trade route once your merchant arrives at their destination, or else you're just wasting turns with them traveling all over the map.</p><p>It's usually wise to have at least one or two merchants roaming the map in Civilization VII. This earns you more resources, increases your relationship with other leaders, and lets you increase the stats of your settlements.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

                <p>Marvel actor Simu Liu has revealed that he is attempting to revive the Sleeping Dogs series with a movie and a sequel to the 2012 game. Liu, who starred in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, said on social media that it's been a "tiring" process to pitch Sleeping Dogs to executives, going on to note how only a small percentage of film projects that are pitched ever get made.</p><p>"Everyone's overwhelming love of Sleeping Dogs here has give us life," he said, referring to the social media campaign to get a Sleeping Dogs movie off the ground. Liu said his plan is to make a Sleeping Dogs movie first, "then a sequel game for everyone," or at least, "that's always been the dream."</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-in-development-and-were-hearing-shang-chi-star-simu-liu-is-set-to-play-wei-shen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A source told IGN</a> that a Sleeping Dogs movie is actually in development, with Liu on board to play the lead role of Wei Shen. A movie being in "development" doesn't mean it'll ever get made, though, only that <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/your-projects-in-development-now-what" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-production work is being done in some capacity.</a></p><p>Plenty of video game movies get announced and never come out for any number of reasons. Sleeping Dogs itself has been in development as a movie in some form for nearly a decade, after all, as Donnie Yen was at one point trying to make a Sleeping Dogs movie before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-movie-from-donnie-yen-may-never-happen/1100-6528726/" data-ref-id="1100-6528726">apparently giving up. </a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/simuliu/status/1885252869483340236?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">So few film projects make it from pitch phase to greenlight. Pitching execs who don’t understand the game has been tiring. Everyone’s overwhelming love of Sleeping Dogs here has really given us life!<br>First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone… that’s always been the dream. <a href="https://t.co/g84r9Lf0SI" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/g84r9Lf0SI</a></p>  — Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The original Sleeping Dogs game had players take control of undercover cop Wei Shen, who was tasked with infiltrating the Triad gangs operating in Hong Kong and gathering evidence on their various illegal activities.</p><p>Despite being well-received by critics and fans, Sleeping Dogs never managed to become a franchise. A spin-off, Triad Wars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-spin-off-triad-wars-shutting-down/1100-6433352/">was canceled during its beta</a>, and developer United Front Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-developer-shuts-down-latest-game-no-/1100-6444545/">shut down in 2016</a>. A Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition was released in 2014.</p>
