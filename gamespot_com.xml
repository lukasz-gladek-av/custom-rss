The roads of Ashes of the Damned are dangerous, so you'll want the map's new Wonder Vehicle in order to survive. Here we'll guide you through how to repair and upgrade Ol' Tessie to make the truck even more powerful. We'll also include some helpful tips for finding and respawning the truck.</p><p dir="ltr">The full upgrade quest requires the use of the map's unique Necrofluid Wonder Weapon, and you'll want to get started on these steps as soon as possible. You can refer to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-wonder-weapon-how-to-get-the-necrofluid-gauntlet-in-ashes-of-the-damned/2900-7261/#6">how to unlock the Necrofluid Wonder Weapon</a>. There are also parts for later steps that you can collect early in your match, so it's best to read through the parts needed for Tessie's turret upgrade before getting started.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing all upgrades for Ol' Tessie will also unlock the Black Ops 7 trophy/achievement titled "I Heard You Like Upgrades."</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Ashes_of_the_Damned_s_Wonder_Vehicle_explained">Ashes of the Damned's Wonder Vehicle explained</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_fully_upgrade_Ol__Tessie">How to fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</a><ul><li><a href="#T_E_D_D__upgrade">T.E.D.D. upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Pack_a_Punch_upgrade">Pack-a-Punch upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Abomination_upgrade">Abomination upgrade</a></li><li><a href="#Turret_upgrade">Turret upgrade</a><ul><li><a href="#Ravager_Eyes">Ravager Eyes</a></li><li><a href="#Human_Bones">Human Bones</a></li><li><a href="#Widow_s_Lantern">Widow's Lantern</a></li><li><a href="#Hoard_Husk_Chunks">Hoard Husk Chunks</a></li><li><a href="#Powder_of_the_Forgotten">Powder of the Forgotten</a></li><li><a href="#Mysterious_Limb">Mysterious Limb</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Create_serum_in_Yuri_s_Lab">Create serum in Yuri's Lab</a></li><li><a href="#Collect_three_keys">Collect three keys</a><ul><li><a href="#Nightbird_key__Red_key_">Nightbird key (Red key)</a></li><li><a href="#Bruin_key__Yellow_key_">Bruin key (Yellow key)</a></li><li><a href="#Terrapin_key__Green_key_">Terrapin key (Green key)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Tips_and_tricks_to_know_for_finding_and_repairing_Ol__Tessie">Tips and tricks to know for finding and repairing Ol' Tessie</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Ashes_of_the_Damned_s_Wonder_Vehicle_explained">Ashes of the Damned's Wonder Vehicle explained</h2><p dir="ltr">Ol' Tessie is the new Wonder Vehicle for Ashes of the Damned. This map doesn't feature a traditional map layout, and instead, it's a massive map with six main POIs connected by dangerous stretches of road.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of a match, you're guided through making the first two enhancements to Ol' Tessie, including the powerful Pack-a-Punch upgrade, but then the quest markers disappear. There are more powerful upgrades the game doesn't tell you about, and there are some helpful tools and tricks to help you keep your Wonder Vehicle in good shape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863"></a><figcaption>Ol' Tessie</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to always keep moving when you're driving Ol' Tessie on the connecting roads. She's fragile in her beginning state, so you don't want her breaking down and leaving you stranded on the roads. You can repair her with salvage or let her regenerate health over time, but it's really hard to do this and stay alive, especially in a solo match.</p><p dir="ltr">There are glowing plant pods scattered all throughout the roads of the map, and you'll want to swerve around and avoid these, as they explode and deal a lot of damage to your truck. Ravager enemies will also latch on and deal damage, so don't stop until you get to the next POI, and then the Ravagers will disappear.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_fully_upgrade_Ol__Tessie">How to fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="T_E_D_D__upgrade">T.E.D.D. upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">The initial quest markers will guide you to the T.E.D.D. part in the spawn area, so you get your first upgrade quickly in your match. You take the part from the Quick Revive room and interact with Ol' Tessie to install it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pack_a_Punch_upgrade">Pack-a-Punch upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">After making the first upgrade, your quest marker will then guide you to Ashwood. You'll need to follow your objective markers to turn on the power here, and then you can access the garage. This is where you'll add the Pack-a-Punch upgrade, as well as the additional hidden upgrades mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that this Pack-a-Punch upgrade means you can always upgrade your guns on the go. You can even use the machine from the truck bed without ever getting out.</p><p dir="ltr">This Pack-a-Punch upgrade also adds a boost to the truck, so you can flee those pesky Ravagers and get to your location even faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606865" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606865"></a><figcaption>Abomination Carcass part in the diner's freezer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606865-abominationcarcass.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Abomination_upgrade">Abomination upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">The next upgrade will add the monstrous mouths of the Abomination creature from Black Ops 6. To do this, you'll need to head to Exit 115. A special zombie called "The Cook" will spawn in or around the diner. Kill this zombie and <strong>pick up the freezer key</strong> that it drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Go inside the diner and use the key on the locked freezer. This lets you grab the Abomination Carcass upgrade. Take the part back to the garage in Ashwood to install it via the upgrade bench.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Abomination Heads upgrade, you'll be able to use R1/RB to shoot beams from the Abomination's mouths. This will help kill enemies in your path.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Turret_upgrade">Turret upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">This final upgrade takes time and a lot of effort to collect parts, and one of them won't be available until after round 15.

If black smoke appears, you'll need to try again next round.</p><p dir="ltr">If the smoke is red, you can interact with the table to add blood to the mix. Doing so will <strong>start a lockdown survival step</strong>. Be prepared. This is a tough place to survive, so make sure you have stuff to help you.

Once you survive, you can continue with the quest, which now requires you to collect keys.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Collect_three_keys">Collect three keys</h3><p dir="ltr">Three glowing keys are hidden on the roads between the POIs. Some of the key spawns are just out of reach, so you need the Necrofluid Gauntlet to help you get these. Out-of-reach keys can be shot with the Necrofluid Gauntlet, and then you just need to hit reload with the weapon to pull the item to the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">Each glowing key needs to be brought to the diamond-shaped box that's chained up in Ashwood on the west side of the map. This looks just like the strange locked item that appeared in the mirror step shown above.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Nightbird_key__Red_key_">Nightbird key (Red key)</h4><p dir="ltr">The red key is found in the Orda Graveyard, which you reach when traveling from Ashwood to Exit 115, and keep to the right path.

She can also be repaired more quickly with Salvage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606884-ashwoodtessierespawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606884-ashwoodtessierespawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606884"></a><figcaption>Ashwood garage</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606884-ashwoodtessierespawn.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ashes of the Damned is a huge map, and it's easy to get separated from your truck, especially in a co-op session. You can use the button on the outer wall of the Ashwood garage to respawn the truck for 1,000 points, or you can go to the teleport pad inside the garage to pay 500 points to teleport inside the truck, wherever it is on the map. This makes reuniting with teammates and locating the truck quicker than running the roads.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not in Ashwood and need to get to the garage, you can use a jump pad at one of the main POIs to get back there. The jump pads only cost 500 points, so this is a cheap way to bounce around POIs when needed.</p>

                <p>If you've accepted the Our Presence Up There quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to visit the Pattern House on Dam Battlegrounds and perform a few quick tasks. It's a relatively straightforward quest, but knowing where each objective is located can make things move much more quickly--which can be important in a high-traffic area like the Pattern House.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete Our Presence Up There, but you'll be pretty close to an extraction point, so you might as well try to get out alive if possible. Additionally, the Pattern House is often home to a lot of really good loot (especially during a Night Raid), making it worth trying to haul some stuff back to Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to get started on Our Presence Up There, follow the guide below.</p><h2>How to complete Our Presence Up There in Arc Raiders</h2><p>To complete Our Presence Up There, you'll need to head to the Pattern House POI, which is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This is a spot a lot of folks visit for blueprint farming, as well as a common spawn point, so keep an eye out for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794" data-ratio="0.56268958543984" data-width="1978" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794"></a><figcaption>Pattern House location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Pattern House, enter through the front and head to the staircase on the bottom floor. Before going up, look for a room to the left of the stairs and enter it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606795-share_20251118_0807433.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606795" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606795-share_20251118_0807433.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606795"></a><figcaption>Enter this door left of the stairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606795-share_20251118_0807433.jpeg"></figure><p>Inside this room is a power switch on the wall.

Here, at the edge of the roof, is an antenna with a terminal. Interact with this to activate the antenna and complete the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606798-share_20251118_0807411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606798-share_20251118_0807411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606798"></a><figcaption>Interact with this terminal to activate the antenna.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606798-share_20251118_0807411.jpeg"></figure><p>With the quest complete, you can now finish looting the Pattern House if you'd like, or you can head on down to the nearby North Complex Elevator to get back home. This extraction point is usually crawling with ARC and is often camped by other raiders, though, so approach it carefully if you're carrying anything particularly valuable--and be ready for a fight if necessary. Best of luck, raider.</p><p>For more, check our our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

<section><p>Metaphor: ReFantazio actor Caleb Yen spoke to GameSpot about his most memorable moments and lines from the critically acclaimed RPG.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Though this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/">awards season</a> is just around the corner, lately I've found myself reminiscing about my favorite game of 2024 and, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year</a>: Metaphor: ReFantazio. The fantasy RPG quickly captivated me upon its release late last year for myriad reasons, but perhaps what impressed me most about Metaphor was Atlus' ability to make this high-stakes, fantastical adventure ultimately feel grounded and deeply human.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps this shouldn't have been as surprising as it was considering Atlus's catalog of games, many of which tactfully explore ideas like mortality, oppression, and self-actualization. But whereas the Persona titles and the studio's one-off games like Catherine are still rooted in real-life, Metaphor offered a dramatic departure from our world. A large part of what grounds this, of course, is the game's writing and overarching story, but another part of what truly makes this work are the Metaphor's fantastic performances.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, I was delighted when the actor behind Metaphor's protagonist, Caleb Yen, volunteered to answer some questions about his performance and time spent working on the game. Yen opened up to GameSpot about his favorite lines, how to inject humor into an earnest character, and that awkwardness that comes with playing a game he's in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606806" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606806"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606806-4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Prior to Metaphor: ReFantazio, Atlus had largely shied away from having fully voiced protagonists. What was it like learning you'd be tasked with realizing one of the </strong><strong>studio's lead characters?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Caleb Yen:</strong> To be honest, when I got the booking email I kind of freaked out–[but] in a positive, screamy, "Oh my God, I'm so psyched for this" way. Getting to voice the protagonist for so many key story moments, and even having some weighty monologues in the latter half of the game, was such a gift.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One thing I loved about your performance was how much humor you brought </strong><strong>to the role. How did you go about balancing your portrayal of someone who is largely a </strong><strong>very earnest and noble character, yet can be a bit awkward or goofy at times?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We all have layers, you know? Even when stuff is weighty, or crazy things are happening, we usually still get a little humor in there--a little silliness. I think the protagonist is the same way, especially because when we meet him in the story, he isn't really a fighter. All of this is new to him. He is on this journey for the right reasons, he wants justice for his best friend and the kingdom, but he can also be a silly little guy sometimes because he doesn't always know what's going on. But he grows as the story progresses, and that was really amazing to play.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'd love to hear what your thoughts were when you first read the game's story. What </strong><strong>moments stood out to you the most? Which storylines were you most drawn to?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First off, I just thought the story was incredible. The worldbuilding in Metaphor: ReFantazio is fantastic with all of the different tribes and how they interact, as well as the history of the world itself. Every character makes the decisions they make because of the world they live in and how society has affected them, and that's just peak writing.</p><p dir="ltr">I love how deeply the companion stories are written. Any one of these guys could be the protagonist of their own game. Strohl is dealing with so much responsibility and survivor's guilt, Heismay is juggling being an outcast with mourning for his son, and Hulkenberg feels disgraced as a knight but her duty truly goes beyond her title. And that's only getting into the first three companions! I love my weird found family!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4606805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4606805"></a><figcaption>The protagonist stands beside Gallica, Strohl, and Hulkenberg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4606805-4378504-metaphorrefantazio%E2%80%94awakenofficialtrailer_summergamefest20240-41screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Forging bonds is a huge part of Metaphor: ReFantazio, so I'd love to know which bonds </strong><strong>you had the most fun bringing to life. Are there certain actors you felt you had </strong><strong>remarkable chemistry with, or characters whose stories felt particularly impactful?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">All of them were so good! For actors I had chemistry with, all of my stuff with Gallica was way fun to play because Alejandra Reynoso and I had previously worked together. Our characters had a similar relationship in a different title, where she sort of acted as my older sister or parental figure, so getting to have her as a fairy guide here just made sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Heismay's story hit me like a truck. Following this older guy on his journey, learning about how he just wanted to help his people by interacting with other tribes but got ostracized for it, and then seeing him mourn for the loss of his son and try to find a final resting place…it was just so powerful.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is it going back and playing a game you voiced the main character in? Do you find it a bit awkward or difficult?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A little bit! I hear myself so much when I'm playing! But it's also just really cool to be a part of such a fantastic game and I'm so proud of the work I and the rest of the cast did, as well as the team in general, so I get over it pretty quickly.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are one or two of your favorite voice lines you delivered in Metaphor: ReFantazio? Which of your colleagues' lines are most memorable to you?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps unsurprisingly, I had so much fun with the "Awaken!" line. I'm also a huge Persona fan, so getting to say, "Persona!" was pretty dreamy. At some point I say something like "a ghost," which made me laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">[Yet] nothing sticks in my head more than Philippe Spall roaring, "Oh power of kings!" as Heismay. This little bat guy <em>looks </em>like a mascot character but he is <em>not</em>--he's so awesome.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the entirety of the scene where everyone is banging stuff together to call Heismay out. I love those line deliveries--it's so funny! Did I mention I love my weird found family?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that really pushed my love for Metaphor over the edge was </strong><strong>the unabashed social commentary. What was it like voicing this game in the midst of a </strong><strong>really tumultuous time period, politically?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think Metaphor: ReFantazio has themes that are truly universal. Every character is dealing with expectations society puts on them due to how they were born, who their people are, their family's position, and a bunch of other factors they can't control. They have to balance all of that with what they truly want in life, who they want to be true to, and pursue the ending that matters the most to them. It's an amazing game because each character truly feels tied to the lore and story that is uniquely Metaphor: ReFantazio, and I'm so thankful to be a part of it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>

      </div>
<p>"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game' I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game," the developer said.</p><p>They added: "I really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. You should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! Thanks again!"</p><p>As of yet, representatives for The Game Awards have not responded to Megabonk's announcement, nor has organizer Geoff Keighley. If the game is indeed withdrawn from the official ballot, it remains to be seen if another title could take its place. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>Megabonk was released in September on PC and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3405340/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached an all-time peak of more than 100,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>The $10 game that has "Very Positive" reviews on Steam has players smashing their way through ongoing waves of enemies. A new update is "coming soon," the developer said, though it's unclear what's in the update.</p><p>As for games that are still nominated, that's all of them except Megabonk, including the Game of the Year nominees: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades II, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p><p>For more, check out all the nominees in the gallery below.</p>

                <p>As of November 18, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew is now an included benefit with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</a></li><li><a href="#What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_">What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs </a></li><li><a href="#Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. </p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_"><span>What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate <em>just </em>for Crew.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official FAQs</a> do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.</p>
