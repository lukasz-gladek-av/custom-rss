                <p>Electronic Arts and DICE have announced Battlefield Labs, a new community test program for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a> that aims to help make the new game the best it can be. EA is rolling out this program in the wake of the poor reception to Battlefield 2042, which launched in a rough state back in 2021.</p><p>EA also announced Battlefield Studios, which is the new banner under which four studios will make "the future of Battlefield." These development teams include DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, and Motive. <strong>DICE</strong> is working on multiplayer, <strong>Motive</strong> is developing single-player content (and multiplayer maps), <strong>Ripple Effect</strong> is making an unannounced new Battlefield experience, and <strong>Criterion</strong> is a partner studio supporting single-player, EA said in the video below. The first gameplay footage for the new Battlefield game was also released in the video and can be see--albeit briefly and in pre-alpha form--at the end of the video.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>How to sign up for Battlefield Labs</strong></h2><p>Anyone can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a>, but DICE said only a select number of players will be admitted, and the test itself is only open to people in North America and Europe to begin with. More territories will be added later as the test environment expands. Only a "few thousand" people will get in to the test, EA said, and it will comprise both Battlefield veterans and newcomers alike. Eventually, EA will ramp up the test to include "tens of thousands" of people.</p><p>Those who are chosen for the testing program will get to play an early version of the next Battlefield game and share feedback with DICE to help make the game the best Battlefield possible. The testing will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is our most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history, launching as we enter a critical phase in development," DICE said. "We want to build Battlefield with our community. So it is a space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of Battlefield; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is launching as we enter a critical phase in development with what's next for Battlefield where we are looking to cross-collaborate with the community like never before. Now is the time to test big areas of the experiences our teams have been building for our upcoming launch."</p><p>The first Battlefield Labs test will begin "in the coming weeks," DICE said. An EA Account is required. EA said there will not be a "rigid cadence" for the testing sessions. "The plan is to run sessions that are at appropriate times for different players in different regions, and build (to allow for repeated testing) every few weeks. Test sessions scheduled will be pre-defined and communicated directly to Battlefield Labs participants ahead of them taking place," EA said.</p><p>As for the available content, EA said players admitted to the test will get to try an "early test of concepts and mechanics, and that players should expect "rough edges, bugs, and crashes."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs content will be tested at a time in our development when it is critical for us to cross-collaborate with our community, with their feedback being crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience," EA said. "Each Battlefield Labs testing session will have specific feedback goals, whether very specific to core combat loops, or map layout for example, or more general goals around the content being tested and how fun it is for players."</p><p>EA said it will test "almost everything" via the Battlefield Labs program.</p><p>"Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at. We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel," EA said. "This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play."</p><p>The Conquest and Breakthrough modes will be in the Battlefield Labs tests as well, EA assured fans, referring to the franchise's most iconic modes. "BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play," EA said.</p><p>Players can submit feedback directly to the developers via a private Discord channel. EA said its teams will collect feedback and come up with plans that inform "what we need to prioritize, what we need to improve, and what we need to change to make it an authentic Battlefield experience when we release it publicly."</p><p>EA said it will publish public recaps of what it's learned from the testing phases, in addition to the steps being taken to address fan feedback. What that means is even if you don't get chosen to participate, you'll still be able to learn about what's changing and why.</p><p>EA also noted that everyone invited to the test will have to sign an NDA that prohibits them from talking about or showing off any footage of the early version of the next Battlefield.</p><p>What's more, EA published the system requirements on PC for the Battlefield Labs test, which can be seen below.</p><ul><li>PC Minimum Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li><li>PC Recommended Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-10700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li></ul><p>The test environment for the new Battlefield game is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/" data-ref-id="1100-6526539">EA already confirmed a large-scale testing period for the game back in 2024.</a></p><h2><strong>Battlefield Studios</strong></h2><p>As for the shift to the Battlefield Studios umbrella, EA said it needed multiple teams to realize its ambition for the future of Battlefield.</p><p>"To make our vision for the future of Battlefield a reality, we had to think bigger than just one studio. We rallied 20+ years of Battlefield experience, combined them with the best emerging talent in the industry, and united them under a single banner: Battlefield Studios," EA said. "This represents the largest team in franchise history, across a world-class group of development studios, focused on delivering on our ambitious vision for the future full of fun, authentic Battlefield experiences for our community built on our unique DNA."</p><p>The next Battlefield, which doesn't have an official title yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">returns to modern times</a> after Battlefield 2042 took the fight to the future. Battlefield boss Vince Zampella said previously that Battlefield 2042 didn't resonate with fans in part because some of the game's ideas were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-strayed-a-little-too-far-from-what-makes-the-series-fun-ea-exec-says/1100-6507599/undefined/" data-ref-id="1100-6507599">too ambitious</a>, like its 128-player matches.</p><p>"I think they just strayed a little too far from what Battlefield is. They tried to do a couple things that were maybe ambitious: grow the player count etc. I don't think they spent enough time iterating on what makes that fun," Zampella said. "It's not inherently a bad idea. The way they were set up and the way they executed just didn't allow them to find the best thing possible."</p><p>DICE's new GM, Rebecka Coutaz, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">the work-from-home setup was challenging as well for Battlefield 2042.</a></p><p>"It is different to work from home, even though that is the way we're working now, it took time to adapt," Coutaz said. "And it took time to know how to work well together. Everybody was disappointed--our community, our players, and our team as well. It's a team that has invested years of their lives into this game. And for that game not to live up to any expectations from the team or from the players, that was tough. We are moving forward and we've done a lot of things since then."</p><p>Zampella was elevated to the overall boss of Battlefield after Battlefield 2042's launch. He has said that under his watch, the Battlefield series is being developed under a "whole new structure."</p><p>"We're putting multiple studios together. We're bringing the best talent together and giving them the time to do something amazing," Zampella said.</p><p>Though Battlefield 2042 might not have landed with everyone, the game finished 2021 as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">fifth-best-selling game of the year in the US</a>.</p>

                <p>Civilization VII reviews have gone live, and the new entry in the series is proving to be quite divisive with critics. A 4X turn-based strategy game, Civilization VII offers a familiar foundation for returning players, as you'll pick an influential leader from human history, expand an empire through various eras, and aim to reach multiple societal milestones along the way.</p><p>The difference here is that developer Firaxis shakes up that formula with big changes, with these tweaks ranging from impactful to possibly controversial for veterans of the series. It's also worth noting that all of these reviews were done on PC, the platform that's generally considered to be the best for traditional 4X strategy games like this. The game is also coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch, so it remains to be seen how well the experience translates to consoles.</p><p>"For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period," Jason Rodriguez noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/" data-ref-id="1900-6418332">Civilization VII review</a>. "Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes."</p><p>Critical reception from other outlets has been mixed, and on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, Civilization VII currently has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metascore</a> of 79 from 32 reviews. Some of these reviews have praised Firaxis for the sweeping changes made to the game's formula, while other critics have commented on how the game can be frustrating and frequently dull. For a closer look, you can read below to see what the critics have to say so far.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Civilization VII</li><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch</li><li><strong>Release date:</strong> February 11</li><li><strong>Metascore:</strong> 79</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 80</h2><p>"Sid Meier's Civilization VII's "one more turn" aspect is still as engaging as ever, and I enjoyed huge portions of my playthroughs. Several facets, such as those related to diplomacy, espionage, crises, and combat address long-standing concerns. Legacy Paths and narrative events, meanwhile, offer rich and rewarding avenues for advancement through the ages. Unfortunately, as someone who's seen the heights that previous series entries have reached, the vanilla Civilization VII experience still needs a few tweaks, as it's held back by the aforementioned issues that occur during brief but crucial era transitions. Granted, the changes this series has undergone over the years--whether it's the square tiles or hexes debate, the "one unit per tile" drama, or city-planning with districts--have been for the better, eventually." -- <em>Jason Rodriguez</em> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VGC -- 5/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII is bold enough to add big changes to its formula, without getting rid of everything that has made the series iconic. Say goodbye to your free time, as from PC to handheld, every waking moment will be consumed by One More Turn." -- <em>Jordan Middler</em> [<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/civilization-7-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Windows Central -- 4.5/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII's biggest changes fix mid- and end-game pacing, clean up clutter on the map, and open up more strategic avenues than ever before. Victory and unit balancing will no doubt be tweaked as developers receive feedback and data, but otherwise, the game is in a great state--something that's becoming increasingly rare in AAA games. Pricing and DLC gripes aside, Civilization VII should prove to be the best playground for world domination for years to come." -- <em>Cale Hunt</em> [<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/civilization-vii-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VG247 -- 4/5</h2><p>"The subtle whiff of compromise in order to launch the game far and wide <em>is</em> there--but compromise is just fine if the end result works. It does. I'm happy. As someone who has somewhere in the region of a thousand hours logged across Civ 4, 5, and 6, I’m ready to add hundreds more to that tally in the seventh entry. Some of that will come in years as the game grows and expands, as is Civilization tradition. But the point is, the foundations here are firm. The legend of one desperate extra turn, over and over again, forever, is secure." -- <em>Alex Donaldson</em> [<a href="https://www.vg247.com/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 4/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII is a revolutionary strategy game for newcomers and long-time fans alike. Though some tweaks around diplomacy and Ages fall short, a host of small reinventions--along with Firaxis' biggest gamble in tackling the tedium of long-running campaigns--pays off superbly." -- <em>Andrew Brown</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/civilization-7-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 70</h2><p>"With Civilization VII, the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface. It's frustratingly inadequate at providing me with the information I need to play well, or even understand what's going on sometimes. Even so, it does have improved warfare and diplomacy, a bit of added narrative flair, as well as mostly gorgeous graphics and sound, so it can still give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night. There’s good reason to believe that with Firaxis's usual pace of patches and expansions it can refine its new ideas and become everything it ought to be, and while what’s here right now is at least still a fun time, it's also a bigger step backward for the series than we're accustomed to when a new age dawns." -- <em>Leana Hafer</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Eurogamer -- 40</h2><p>"Civilization VII is pretty and detailed and sounds fine (I caught that one tune from Colonization!). AI turns are perhaps the fastest I've ever seen, and its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable. Its design broadly works, and a certain kind of city-optimizing fan may even love it. But its lack of character is endemic, the extent of its annoying habits and oversights shocking for a series of such pedigree. It's a dull, contradictory game, and instead of showing everyone how it's done, it's felt since hour one like a game that leaves the 4X throne empty." -- <em>Sin Vega</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

"When there are threats to harm it's crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team," Huynh said. "I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn't from lack of caring or effort."</p><p>The developer added, "While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams." Hunyh also thanked every IP holder for entrusting the studio with their respective franchises and characters.</p><p>Huynh also thanked the developers at Player First Games and fans themselves who played MultiVersus. "Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team. I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out," Huynh said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1052930998" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

saying it comes down to "a bunch of things." These include "development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character."</p><p>The Banana Guard character, from Adventure Time, came into existence because the developers were enthusiastic and created the first cut of the character in a single weekend.</p><p>"When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got Banana Guard because of that. It wasn't at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character," Huynh said.</p><p>Finally, Huynh said they hope fans enjoy Season 5--which is the final season--and that fans of MultiVersus direct their time and money to other fighting games to support the genre overall.</p><p>"Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don't know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players," Huynh said.</p><p>MultiVersus, a platformer brawler similar to Super Smash Bros., first launched into open beta in 2022 and was then taken down for a period of time after a year. It then came back fully released in 2024 with new content. It features characters from across various WB properties, including DC, Looney Tunes, and Cartoon Network.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/multiversus-review-a-super-smash-hit/1900-6417930/" data-ref-id="1900-6417930">MultiVersus review,</a> we scored the game an 8/10 and said, "Warner Bros' all-star battle proves to be a worthy contender to the platform fighter throne."</p><p>A free-to-play game, MultiVersus reached an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all-time peak concurrent player figure of more than 150,000 on Steam</a>, but has dropped off substantially, reaching a peak of fewer than 700 players on Steam in the past 24 hours. MultiVersus is also available on console for Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The game will be playable after May via an offline mode that supports local multiplayer or multiplayer against AI opponents. As for Player First Games, as Huynh said, there is no word yet as to what may happen to the studio and its developers. Warner Bros. Games owns the studio, which has no upcoming projects that have been announced and <a href="https://www.playerfirstgames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no open positions on its careers page.</a></p><p>Warner Bros. Games did not disclose a reason for closing MultiVersus. The announcement came just after longtime Warner Bros. gaming boss David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced his exit from the company after more than a decade.</a> That move was preceded by the announcement from Warner Bros. that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/" data-ref-id="1100-6526460">focus only on a small group of mega-franchises for its gaming division</a> in a bid to have the best chance to make the most money.</p><p>MultiVersus is just the latest live-service game to come to a close <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/" data-ref-id="1100-6511171">as the bubble bursts</a>.
