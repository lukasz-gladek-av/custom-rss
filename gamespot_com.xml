                <p>Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate was announced way back in 2021 at the series' 35th anniversary event, where publisher Square Enix showed nothing more than a logo. Since then, the game has been under wraps, and so little has been said about it that many fans speculated that it may have been shelved. However, series creator Yuji Horii recently confirmed that he and his studio continue to be hard at work on the game.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamereactor</a>, Horii stated that work on Dragon Quest XII was still underway. Despite not being able to share any details about gameplay, Horii said, "I am making it, putting lots of work into it... I can only say that the next work will be great too, [I'm] working really hard." He also called for fans to remain excited for the future of the franchise: "Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say." </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest 12: The Flames Of Fate - Official Title Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the game now very likely to launch after the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Horii was asked if there are any plans for the new console, especially considering the franchise's past commercial successes on the original Switch. Although Horii is vague in the interview about what Dragon Quest properties might come to the new system, he mentioned, "I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well." </p><p>Most of the specifics we know about Dragon Quest XII come from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-the-flames-of-fate-announced/1100-6492022/" data-ref-id="1100-6492022">Horii's statements from around the time of its original announcement</a> four years ago. He shared that the game is meant to provide players more options and more choices with how to play, and that Square Enix will be significantly changing the franchise's command battle system. </p><p>While Dragon Quest XII may be a ways off, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/" data-ref-id="1100-6530455">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D preorders are now live</a> and will launch later in 2025. This remake follows up last year's release of Dragon Quest III HD-2D.</p>

The show stars Marvel's Zoe Saldana as a CIA officer who heads up the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a44619029/special-ops-lioness-true-story/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Lioness" program of female operators. </a></p><p>Senior producer Philippe Ducharme, meanwhile, said he was a big fan of Oscar-nominated director Alex Garland's 2023 war movie, Civil War, which followed a team of journalists covering a new American civil war. "Some of the things that we're pushing [in this game], the film is actually a good reference," Ducharme said.</p><p>Campos-Oriola said a guiding theme for the Battlefield 6 campaign is exploring the concept of "talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations."</p><p>"That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we're looking to capture in the single player," the developer said.</p><p>EA Motive previously developed the 2023 Dead Space remake, and Ducharme said that game is "obviously very different" from Battlefield. However, the Ducharme said the idea was to explore the "curve of tension" of the "highs and the lows to keep players hooked."</p><p>In addition to the campaign, Battlefield 6 will of course have a substantial multiplayer element, and DICE is returning to develop it. It's also rumored that the Portal mode from Battlefield 2042 might come back.</p><p>EA is currently conducting early testing for the game as part of the Battlefield Labs program, and it's spawned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks-show-off-impressive-destruction-and-gunplay/1100-6531158/" data-ref-id="1100-6531158">numerous leaks with players sharing footage publicly</a> even though EA forbids this.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has no release date, but some believe it might release as soon as this fall. Officially, EA has confirmed that it's on track for release by the end of March 2026. Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 is delayed to 2026</a>, EA recently teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">Battlefield 6's release window is clearer than before</a> following GTA 6's delay.</p>

                <p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> last month, many players remarked on how similar it looks to the original Switch. Especially compared to the jump between the Wii U and the Switch--or even the Wii and Wii U--the Switch to Switch 2 transition is more iterative than revolutionary, at least in terms of the form factor. From recent comments <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an investor call</a>, Nintendo itself is aware of this, and it stresses that the Switch 2's hardware has been built "from the ground up."</p><p>Responding to a question about the Switch 2's apparent lack of generational change, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged that "it may appear that there is not a major change between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." However, Furukawa told investors that the Switch 2 was designed as a full new console, not beholden to the hardware of the original Switch. "We have created new hardware and accessories from the ground up," Furukawa said, "and these are products very characteristic of Nintendo, packed full of our development team's dedication to quality through various creative efforts and integrated hardware-software development."</p>

<p>Furukawa also explained that the Switch 2 is meant to allow Nintendo to continue innovating in gameplay and software. He noted that the original Switch's processing power has become an obstacle for game developers working with the platform. "Over the course of these eight years and counting," he stated, "it has become necessary to increase hardware processing performance in order for software developers to realize one of Nintendo's most valued tenets: offering new gameplay experiences. Thus, this time we decided to design the hardware with enhanced processing capability."</p><p>During the earnings call, Nintendo executives additionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-warns-of-substantial-negative-impact-from-tariffs/1100-6531512/" data-ref-id="1100-6531512">addressed the looming threat of tariffs</a>, mentioning that US tariff policy could cost the company tens of millions of dollars in forecasted revenue. This number may shift in light of continued changes in US trade policy, but Nintendo has been open about how the uncertainty caused by trade shifts have impacted the company's plans for the Switch 2 launch.</p><p>Switch 2 launches on June 5, and preorders are underway. The console costs considerably more than its predecessor, a change that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">Nintendo has said may pose an obstacle for widespread early adoption</a>. Despite this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders quickly sold out at US merchants</a>, and there is no indication yet of when there might be a restock.</p>

<p>This effort is just the first of what the companies describe as a series of "co-branded marketing promotions" throughout Ubisoft's catalogue of games. They also stated that "select" Visa cardholders in Europe and the UK can expect Ubisoft+ promotions, game codes, and other exclusives.</p><p>This partnership comes in the wake of a turbulent year for Ubisoft.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is launching in early June amid ongoing drama and uncertainty about tariffs, and now Nintendo has put a dollar amount to how much of a negative impact it's forecasting as a result.</p><p>Speaking to analysts and investors as part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo has factored in a negative impact of "several tens of billions of yen at the profit level." Ten billion yen equals about $67 million, so it's not a small amount.</p><p>Furukawa said Nintendo is basing this off the US tariff rates effective April 10. It's now mid-May, and things have developed since then. Just recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-switzerland-tariffs-negotiations-b3f5174d086e39b2522ab848ddad9372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the US and China reached an agreement</a> that sees the US drop its previous 145% tariff rate on China down to 30%, with China lowering its rate on the US from 125% to 10%. This deal is set to last for 90 days, which would take it beyond the Switch 2 release date.</p><p>Given Nintendo's forecast was based on what the tariff rate was on April 10, there might be different calculations going on at Nintendo now that tariffs on goods from China have been lowered massively. This has been a fluid situation for Nintendo and many other companies bringing in goods to the US from China (Switch 2 consoles are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia).</p><p>Furukawa made these comments during Nintendo's latest earnings briefing on May 8, and the English translation was not posted until today, May 13. The US and China announced their joint trade deal on May 12.</p><p>Furukawa went on to say that the Switch 2 is expected to have a lower profit margin that the original Switch, which has been on sale since 2017.</p><p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price. However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive added that if there are further changes to tariff policies for China and other markets, Nintendo would consider "what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate," if any.</p><p>For context, Nintendo is <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">projecting</a> 320 billion yen in operating profit and 380 billion yen in ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, along with 300 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 528.9 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 680.5 billion yen, and 490.6 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2025</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 282.5 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 372.3 billion yen, and 278.8 billion in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>Nintendo is expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 units during the current fiscal year that ends March 31, 2026</a>, and that's about the same as the original Switch over its first 10 months in the market. Furukawa said the Switch 2's "relatively high" price compared to the original Switch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">it's $50 more expensive with inflation factored in</a>--represents one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">"challenges to early adoption"</a> of the system.</p><p>"The limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor in setting our sales volume forecast. Additionally, the tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo held its big Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that US President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on China. Responding to this, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> would not begin on April 9, but were instead delayed to later in the month, with many wondering if Nintendo would raise the price of the console as a result. That did not happen, but the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some Switch 2 accessories. </a></p>

In terms of price, this works out to roughly $7 for the battle pass if you don't have any of the premium in-game currency saved up. NetEase added that it is considering bringing older battle passes back in the future, but these will cost at least 20% more. There'll be no free rewards in these limited-time battle passes either, as NetEase noted that access to all rewards will require the purchase of the Luxury Battle Pass.</p>

<p>"Future Battle Pass returns might occur, but any such plans will span at least two seasons and be priced at a minimum of 20% higher than the original seasonal rate," the studio said in a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend of gaming becoming more expensive lately, as a variety of factors like turbulent market conditions, the increasing cost of video game development, and US President Donald Trump's tariff threats <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">have had a knock-on effect on the industry</a>.</p><p>As for why digital goods like battle passes are increasing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-digital-game-prices-are-going-up-too/1100-6531277/">there are multiple reasons here as well</a>. Increasing prices on a digital product can help offset rising costs in other departments, but the simplest explanation here is that these price increases are being made simply because a developer or publisher <em>can </em>do it.</p><p>With the Switch 2 launching next month, we've seen Nintendo raise the price of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">several of its first-party games to $80</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">while Microsoft has announced price increases for its Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> and games as well.</p>

The Illuminate have emerged from the Meridian singularity, and they're bringing the fight to Super Earth. As detailed by Arrowhead in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" rel="nofollow ">latest Sony blog</a>, this update includes the Stingray, which are enemy fighter jets that provide aerial support for the Illuminate. Stingrays can target players and line up devastating strafing runs. Another new threat is an enemy called Fleshmob, which the developer describes as being a failed Illuminate experiment and a "Frankenstein's monster of Voteless parts."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Galactic Emergency Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">These are just some of the new enemy types players can encounter. The developer also alludes to other threats by saying, "There have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities," so players will likely have a few surprises to discover.</p><p dir="ltr">The update adds weapon customization and progression to Helldivers 2. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then will unlock new attachments players can obtain through Requisition. This allows for weapon customization and tuning, such as adjusting ammo capacity, fire rate, recoil, and reload time.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can unlock patterns to visually customize their weapons. A variety of patterns which were previously tied to Warbonds (Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds) will be made available to players on May 15, which is when the new "Masters of Ceremony" Warbond arrives.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Superstore has been changed so items players want are always available, whereas previously they had to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead has also released a new gameplay trailer ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465961/">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a>.</p>
