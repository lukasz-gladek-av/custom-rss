                <p>Fantastic Pixel Castle, the NetEase-owned MMO studio founded by former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> lead system designer Greg Street, will shut down November 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Street announced the studio's closure date in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. In weeks prior, Street stated NetEase had pulled funding from the studio but had allowed it time to seek out a new publisher or raise funding for their fledgling MMORPG, project Ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">Those efforts have not panned out. Street said "there is still a chance" the studio could secure needed funding and live on, but that it will also depend on how much of the current team will choose to remain should that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle had recently hosted a number of content creators to stream a first public look at project Ghost gameplay. The game was still in its early stages, with Fantastic Pixel Castle having been fairly transparent about its development process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-lfbPENg3I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C-lfbPENg3I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The studio believed recent MMOs have put too much of a focus on solo adventuring and sought to emphasize playing with friends and building an online community, according to the studio's <a href="https://fantasticpixelcastle.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival game</a>, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together. Red Shards featured more classic MMORPG experiences, where large groups of players could team together to fight world bosses or impact the game's world in permanent ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Before forming Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street served at Blizzard as a lead systems designer on WoW for nearly six years, later joining Riot Games. There he held a number of different roles, the last of which was overseeing Riot's first MMO. He left Riot in 2023, and about a year later Riot announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-hits-reset-on-league-of-legends-mmo-with-no-news-for-years-to-come/1100-6522053/" data-ref-id="1100-6522053">hitting reset on its League of Legends MMO</a>, going back to the drawing board after several years of development.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle's closure is just the latest in a long line of layoffs and studio shutterings in 2025, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">major layoffs at Xbox</a>. Early this year, NetEase made headlines when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laid off Marvel Rivals US-based development team</a> despite the game's huge success. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-layoffs-at-us-team-influenced-in-part-by-geopolitical-risks-analyst-says/1100-6529611/" data-ref-id="1100-6529611">report</a> at the time indicated the Chinese-gaming giant was looking to scale back its overseas game business due to "geopolitical risks" and a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000162828025047811/ea-20250930.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new regulatory filing</a>, Electronic Arts outlined a number of the risks the company faces, and one of them is the company's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion sale</a> to a private investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose risks to its business activity in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly 10-Q filings</a>. EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues. Already, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">a group of EA employees wrote a letter to jointly speak out against the proposed sale</a>, expressing a range of issues and concerns about it, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures. The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.

                <p>Rapper Soulja Boy is once again trying to sell a game console, this time selling what looks to be a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2 under the name SouljaGame Flip.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souljaboygame/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=aec8034c-b1b7-449b-ae69-bc2e82cd594a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (spotted by <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>), the artist known for his 2007 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" can be seen showing off what appears to be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2. He said the device is actually a new SouljaGame Flip console that is "out right now" and can be bought from his website. He said it has "all the games you need," a "fast processor," and "good graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulja Boy was originally selling "his" console for $436, over twice the $209 price the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 currently goes for on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid's official website</a>. But since news began to circulate about the rebranded device and its hefty price tag, the price seems to have been slashed to $200, actually making it cheaper than buying the device directly from Retroid.</p><p dir="ltr">The website where the SouljaGame Flip can be ordered shows images that look to be taken straight from Retroid's own website, only with some additional images showing white packaging that say SouljaGame. Even the names of the different console colors on the Soulja Boy website are the same as that of the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, including the GameCube-inspired GC color scheme. The console's store page description states the SouljaGame Flip is "the ultimate handheld gaming console endorsed by Soulja Boy."</p><p dir="ltr">Retro Dodo reached out to Retroid about the whole affair, and received an official statement that made clear Soulja Boy selling repackaged Retroid Pocket Flip 2s is not any kind of official partnership.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is not any kind of official licensing deal," Retroid said. "He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the US by ourselves."</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if Retroid will pursue legal action, but it's not the first time Soulja Boy has tried to sell game consoles. In 2018, the rapper sold Chinese emulators under his own label, and again in 2021 with a rebranded Game Boy-inspired handheld called the TRDR Pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">The handheld gaming market is currently booming, with a growing retro emulation device market and the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Xbox-branded ROG Ally</a>.</p>
