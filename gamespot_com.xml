This includes a message for fans of competitive Call of Duty and maybe a hint of some of the maps arriving with Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">During the grand finals of the 2025 Call of Duty League Championship, Treyarch associate design director Lawrence Metten <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nWAqAuHkpOM?si=dKuZSiqa3OChnilI&amp;t=9171">compared Black Ops 7 to Black Ops 2</a>. "If you're a fan of Black Ops 2 back in the day, especially if you're a fan of Black Ops 2 competitive, you're going to have a good time with Black Ops 7."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 is known for having some of the best competitive maps in Call of Duty history, such as Yemen, Raid, Standoff, and Slums. It's very possible Metten is teasing part of the map pool for Black Ops 7, especially as Treyarch is tasked with developing back-to-back Black Ops titles.</p><p dir="ltr">2023's Modern Warfare 3 was a direct follow-up to Modern Warfare 2, and the game launched with a remastered map pool from the original Modern Warfare 2 game. It's possible Black Ops 7 will follow the same formula with remastered maps at launch, giving more time to develop brand-new multiplayer maps for post-launch content.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Metten discussed the over-40-year time jump between the Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7 storylines. "Not being tied to a previous era has really given us a lot of creative freedom that you're going to feel and experience in our maps and our weapons and our gear," the developer said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

                <p>Gaming industry veteran Hideo Kojima has commented on the semi-recent trend of remote working in the video game business, saying it might not be the ideal way to work but forcing people back to the office isn't a good option either.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>, Kojima said remote work is "almost like a fast food chain" in that people are "just concentrating on one thing instead of the whole project." The publication further reported that Kojima said working remotely as opposed to being in an office together with colleagues can be inefficient for a variety of reasons, including the lack of back-and-forth with people working at a desk next to each other.</p><p>"Only 1% of yourself is on show during [online] meetings," he said. "This is not like building a team. Think about football. You hire someone, he comes to your squad--but you can't play together remotely. So that person doesn't change the way they played before; they won't fit in."</p><p>However, Kojima said he acknowledges that "you can't force people back to the office, you can only persuade them."</p><p>For Kojima Productions specifically, Kojima said "not everyone came back" to the office to work on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the "main members" did.</p><p>Beyond the people working on the game, Kojima said he encountered some challenges with the cast for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. He said it was "quite difficult" to communicate to the actors how they should perform in a particular scene, adding that this was "almost impossible" to do over Zoom.</p><p>Kojima previously said the original Death Stranding, which was released in 2019, was made based on the theme of, "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect."</p><p>Then the COVID pandemic began in 2020. Having lived through the pandemic, Kojima said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-how-kojimas-experience-with-covid-impacted-the-game/1100-6531399/" data-ref-id="1100-6531399">changed his way of thinking when it comes to connection.</a></p><p>"After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings [in Death Stranding 2]. I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title," he said of Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Many video game development studios embraced remote working during the pandemic, and some companies even used it as a selling point to hire new staff. Now, however, some companies are pulling back and asking people to return to the office--if not for a full week, at least partially. Mega-publisher EA, for example, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-full-return-to-office-effectively-ending-remote-work/1100-6531579/" data-ref-id="1100-6531579">effectively ended remote working, which has upset some staffers.</a> Rockstar Games, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">required people to return to the office to finish GTA 6, which also prompted a backlash.</a></p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out now on PS5. If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a> and consult our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-guides-hub/1100-6532611/" data-ref-id="1100-6532611">Death Stranding 2 guides hub</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-tips-beginners-guide/2900-6684/" data-ref-id="2900-6684">help yourself get off to a good start.</a></p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/" data-ref-id="1100-6532868">Kojima's plans to make a game in space</a>, he and his team are working on multiple upcoming new games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint.</a></p>

      </div>
<p>The "Strange Tales of Modern Science" mission, meanwhile, has players investigating a nearby "man of science" who claims he created artificial life near Braithwaite Manor. "Bring the strange experiment to life by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight," reads a line from the mission's description.</p><p>Then there is the "Strange Tales of The Bayou" mission that has players seeking "something unholy" in the swamps of Lagras. Finally, the "Strange Tales of the Wilderness" mission involves meeting up with a scientist who is conducting "strange research" on people in Tall Trees. "When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202" data-ratio="0.54190476190476" data-width="2100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202"></a><figcaption>Strange indeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png"></figure><p>These new missions pay out 3X gold, RDO$, and XP through August 4.</p><p>Red Dead Online did not become the kind of phenomenon that GTA Online did for GTA 5, with fans saying Rockstar did not support the online mode as much as they would have liked to see.
