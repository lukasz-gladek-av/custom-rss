                <p>After spending seven years working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> follow-up is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">one of the most-successful games of 2025</a>. As an encore, Team Cherry has confirmed that there will be DLC released for Silksong. Just don't expect it too soon.</p><p>"I don't really know what else people would necessarily want to hear other than what we're already saying," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us ... I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now."</p><p>Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen "might have some vague ideas" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to "overpromise" and underdeliver to the game's fans. He also teased the return of Steel Assassin Sharpe, an enemy character from the first game.</p><p>"[Sharpe is] just waiting in the wings," said Gibson. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>In the meantime, Team Cherry has continued to support Silksong with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">PC patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, and an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-patch-finally-nerfs-the-muckmaggots/1100-6536098/" data-ref-id="1100-6536098">nerfed the Muckmaggots</a> and replaced the game's unpopular Chinese translation with a fan-made translation that has been much better received than its predecessor. A prior patch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-stomps-out-more-bugs-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6535403/" data-ref-id="1100-6535403">added DualSense Edge support</a> and targeted known bugs in the game. Team Cherry also explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-is-harder-than-hollow-knight-and-its-hornets-fault/1100-6534856/" data-ref-id="1100-6534856">the reason Silksong is so difficult</a> is because they made the leading character, Hornet, so powerful.</p>

"Imagine the audacity of what we were asking them to do with their beloved and sacred intellectual property and the trust that required in us!

                <p>Everstone Studios' free-to-play action-adventure-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/where-winds-meet/" data-ref-id="5000-571339">Where Winds Meet</a> is a game that gives over many of its NPC conversations to chatbots. But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all.</p><p>Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" rel="nofollow ">At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proximis/" rel="nofollow ">u/Proximis</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/" rel="nofollow ">WhereWindsMeet</a></blockquote><p>While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, "the Metal Gear method."</p><p>While the AI chatbots may be technically superior to standard NPC behavior, traditional NPCs wouldn't fall for the same tricks due to their programing. They simply don't have the option to do or say anything outside of their scripted dialogue and actions. The NPCs of Where Winds Fall currently lack those limitations that would have protected them from this exploit.</p><p>Where Winds Meet had its official launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile earlier this month.</p>
