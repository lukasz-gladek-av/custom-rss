                <p>Netflix was working on a AAA multiplayer shooter with a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">the game and the studio were scuttled</a> in 2024. Why? One of Netflix's top gaming bosses, Alain Tascan, said in an interview that this project did not align with the company's goals.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-21/netflix-bets-big-on-video-games-with-broad-new-strategy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tascan told Bloomberg</a>. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p><p>The shift away from this game came amid a wider shakeup at at Netflix's film and TV divisions that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-kind-of-movies-netflix-wants-to-focus-on-going-forward/1100-6522677/" data-ref-id="1100-6522677">calls for fewer, less-expensive releases that aim for higher quality.</a> </p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>Just this week, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spry Fox announced Spirit Crossing for Netflix</a>, while Shenmue designer Yu Suzuki's new game <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/steel-paws-mobile-game-news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steel Paws</a> was released in February. </p>

                <p>One of Valve's most popular games, 1998's Half-Life, could have been the one and only game the company ever released, until a deal was struck that changed the company's fate forever. Monica Harrington, Valve's first chief marketing officer, said at the Game Developers Conference that publisher Sierra had the option for two more games, and after the first Half-Life became a gigantic success, Valve attempted to renegotiate with Sierra.</p><p>The terms of the deal, Harrington said, was that Valve would fund all but $1 million of the development costs of Half-Life's sequels, with Sierra retaining IP rights and giving Valve back 15% of revenue. "It felt insane," Harrington said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/valve-would-never-ship-another-game-former-exec-forced-half-life-publishers-hand-by-saying-gabe-newell-and-the-team-would-pivot-away-from-game-dev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Harrington said that if she and her husband Mike Harrington were to make real money out of being co-owners of Valve at the time, she knew Valve's prospects had to be "much, much brighter," and that included renegotiating with Sierra.</p><p>After getting the OK from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell, Harrington worked with Valve's attorney to hammer out a strategy for getting Half-Life's IP rights back, for the original Half-Life and all future titles. But how?</p><p>Harrington said she pushed for Valve and Sierra to strike a deal with the threat that Valve would abandon making games altogether if Sierra didn't come to the table. "Valve would never ship another game," Harrington recalled of the bargaining tactic.</p><p>"It wasn't an idle threat--we weren't going to take on all of the risk to make other people rich," Harrington said. "Besides, I knew Gabe had interesting ideas that had nothing to do with games."</p><p>One of those ideas was for Valve to create an <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"online entertainment platform" with Amazon</a>, but this fell through. In the end, Valve won back control of the Half-Life series from Sierra. Valve went to release Half-Life 2 in 2004 and later the VR title Half-Life: Alyx in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">that game won GameSpot's Game of the Year</a>. Valve's massively popular Counter-Strike series also traces its roots back to Half-Life, originating as a mod for that game.</p><p>Valve is much more than a game developer today, as it owns and operates the massively popular PC game store Steam. Companies have attempted to buy Valve over the years, but the company remains independent. Newell, for his part, has become a billionaire and now <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">owns a half-dozen yachts that are valued at over $1 billion.</a></p><p>One criticism of Valve today is that the company no longer releases many games, instead focusing more on Steam and hardware with its Steam Deck. It does have more games in the works, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">including a 6v6 MOBA called Deadlock.</a> There is still no word on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-3/">Half-Life 3</a>, however.</p>
