"The main reason we wanted to do that is we wanted not only the fans of the series, but also new players, to start at the same place with the story. Everyone can experience the same thing at the same time."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 2nd Trailer: Formidable Foes Emerge</p>
      </div>
<p>Up until now, all mainline Onimusha games have been connected narratively since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/onimusha-warlords/" data-ref-id="5000-1574">Onimusha: Warlords</a> kicked things off in 2001, often having their protagonists fighting demonic Genma and a possessed Oda Nobunaga's forces. Capcom even went through the effort of remastering the first two games in the series in the 2020s, so it could be believable that it was prepping players to understand the series' overarching narrative and lore prior to its continuation. That's not the case, though, as the only real connection is that players are still fighting Genma and Kadowaki admitted that Way of the Sword's development was separate from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-gets-a-modern-remaster-this-year/1100-6529245/" data-ref-id="1100-6529245">those remaster efforts</a>.</p><p>Players will control a new protagonist named Miyamoto Mushashi, whose face is modeled after actor Toshiro Mifune and who wields an Oni gauntlet that gives him special powers. That all may sound familiar to those who watched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflixs-onimusha-anime-brings-together-three-japanese-legends/2900-4875/" data-ref-id="2900-4875">Onimusha series on Netflix</a> last year. But once again, Kadowaki denied any sort of connection between the show and new game, even though they both feature the same character modeled after the same real-world actor. "There's absolutely no connection with the Netflix animated series," Kadowaki bluntly confirmed.</p><p>If you are planning on playing Onimusha: Way of the Sword when it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026, you at least don't have to worry about this franchise's past, as it's a clean slate narratively.</p>

Brandon Adler said in an interview that Obsidian did not set the price for the game, adding that anyone bothered by the price point should take their concerns to Microsoft.</p><p>"We're a game developer. We love to make games. We don't set the prices for our games," he said in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with GamesRadar</a>. "Like, personally, as a game developer, I wish everybody could play my game, because that's what I want out of this whole thing. But for the reasons and so like, why the $79.99 price point, you'd have to honestly talk to the Xbox folks."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is Microsoft's first $80 game, but it wasn't a total surprise, given that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">said it would begin charging $80 for some games in 2025.</a> Microsoft also raised prices on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, while there are expectations that other publishers will follow suit and start charging more as well. 2K Games has been caught up in pricing drama, too, as Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-reacts-to-price-point-controversy/1100-6531739/" data-ref-id="1100-6531739">he doesn't know if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not.</a></p><p>What Adler said about The Outer Worlds 2 lines up with what Pitchford has said about Borderlands 4. He mentioned that, as an artist, he wants as many people as possible to play his games. At the same time, he acknowledged that it's a business and the company has to keep making money to make more games. Like Adler, Pitchford also noted that he does not set prices; in his case, 2K Games is making the call.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said again and again that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">it's his job to make money and run a successful business</a>, even if this means the company has to make some tradeoffs.</p><p>"We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us," Spencer said.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. If you don't want to pay $80 for it, you can subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate and play it via your membership. Game Pass is not available on PlayStation, however.</p>

<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was incredibly moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johann and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>

                <p>MindsEye, the new action game from former Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies' new studio, launched this week but left a lot to be desired due to technical and performance issues.

During the Konami Press Start showcase, the company announced that a goofier side of Metal Gear Solid will return, as the Secret Theater bonus feature will be included in the upcoming game. Not only will it feature all of the classic cutscenes from Snake Eater, but several new ones have been created for it as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="204">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=204" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Secret Theater was originally an unlockable extra in Snake Eater that reimagined the endings to several cutscenes. These ranged from Snake causing a time paradox to legendary sniper The End falling in love with Eva, and the videos were originally only made for the eyes of Snake Eater's production team.</p><p>These short clips were eventually placed on the official Snake Eater website, and several more were created thanks to them being popular with fans. The original videos will be found as collectibles inside the game, and for the new Secret Theater videos, players will have to track down enemy soldiers carrying rolls of film on their uniforms.</p><p>Konami also revealed a few more extras that'll be in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater when it launches on August 28, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">like a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a>, an Ape Escape crossover on PC and PS5, and a Snake vs. Bomberman mode that'll be exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S version of the game.</p>
