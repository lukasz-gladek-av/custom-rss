                <p>This week, Apple unveiled its next wave of hardware, including four new iPhone models and the next generations of the AirPods Pro and Apple Watch--and Apple users who are looking to grab the new releases can preorder several of the devices now. While the new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are easily the marquee announcements of the presentation, we'll have to wait until September 12 for preorders to open. In the meantime, preorders for the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> are now open at multiple online retailers. Both devices launch on September 19, so you only have a few days left to reserve these devices ahead of release. If you're interested in doing so, we'll go over where you can preorder the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 online. </p><div title="[Various] new Apple AirPods preorders - Sept 9 2025" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4312" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] new Apple AirPods preorders - Sept 9 2025" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$250 | Releases September 19</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The new AirPods Pro 3 are a smaller, more powerful iteration of Apple's premium earbuds, featuring new functionality like in-ear audio translation powered by Apple AI. The feature is similar to the live translation features found on Google's Pixel Buds, allowing you to listen along as the earbuds translate spoken words into your language of choice in real-time. Along with audio translations, the AirPods Pro 3 can connect to iOS devices to provide text translation as well.</p><p>The other big new feature for the AirPods Pro 3 is an integrated heart rate sensor--the smallest heart rate sensor in an Apple device yet. This means you can track workouts and get additional health data tracking just from the AirPods Pro 3 alone.</p><p>There are also several spec upgrades and feature overhauls compared to previous AirPods Pro models, including 4x more effective active noise cancelling (ANC) compared to the original AirPods Pro (and twice as effective compared to the AirPods Pro 2), plus new foam-infused eartips for added passive noise isolation. They also feature enhanced 3D spatial listening and hearing aid functionality, IP57 sweat-proof and waterproof materials, and longer battery life (up to 10 hours during normal listening, or 8 hours with ANC).</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 launch September 19 and will ship with a charging case and five eartip sizes. Preorders are available now for $250 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Apple's online store. Best Buy is offering a few preorder bonuses, including three free months of Apple Fitness+, three months of Apple Music, and two months of Apple TV+.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4311" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Apple Watch Series 11</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Starts at $400 | Releases September 19</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Apple Watch Series 11 introduces several upgrades, including a more durable design that Apple says is twice as scratch-resistant as previous models.

                <p>From Software's games tend to be challenging for most players, and the developer is making things even harder with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">Deep of Night</a> mode. Before that launches later this week, Elden Ring Nightreign has received patch 1.02.2 with new bug fixes and gameplay tweaks. From Software has also shared a video that breaks down some of the changes coming in Deep of Night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qY-Lb37eE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M-qY-Lb37eE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the ways Deep of Night will keep players on edge is that they won't know which Night Lord they're actually facing until the battle begins. Flexibility is going to be the key to overcoming those battles, and the video suggests preparing relic presets before going into those fights.</p><p>More powerful enemies will appear throughout Deep of Night, and players will have the opportunity to pick up weapons that can dispatch them. However, those weapons will have a detrimental effect on player characters that may make battles even more grueling. As players go deeper into Deep of Night, their enemies will become increasingly difficult.</p><p>In the patch notes, From Software indicated that Everdark Sovereign Libra may be a little easier going forward because his Condemned warriors will now have less damage negation and they will drop items that can help players in-battle.</p><p>Guardian class heroes will be receiving increased strength and dexterity when leveling up, as well as a larger range for their ultimate art's attack. The patch also appears to penalize players who drop out of matches, even if their connection was disrupted.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> latest update just introduced a fan-favorite game mode that will have players nostalgic for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-43545">Halo: Reach</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Invasion has made its Halo Infinite debut, just in time for the 15th anniversary of Bungie's last Halo game on September 14. The asymmetrical, one-sided objective mode originally saw Spartans and Elites attacking or defending in Halo: Reach, with the objective for the attackers changing depending on what phase of the map was currently being played. Each team also sported unique weapon loadout options depending on whether they were on the Spartan or Elite side, further emphasizing the mode's asymmetrical nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwreSlUctI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CXwreSlUctI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As broken down in a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/invasion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo Waypoint blog</a>, the Invasion in Halo Infinite is mostly as players remember, minus the ability to play as Elites. Instead, one team will play as Spartans affected by a malignant Banished AI and will sport more Banished/Covenant weapon loadouts similar to that used by the Elite team in Halo: Reach. The mode also originally featured the ability to spawn on a "buddy" on the same team, a feature returning for Halo: Infinite's version of the game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be six Invasion maps made by the game's Forge community, two of which, Breakpoint and Recovery, are remakes of Halo: Reach Invasion maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Invasion is part of Halo Infinite's Warpath update, which additionally adds a new Operation Pass that includes the new Lancer armor set and additional weapon cosmetics. The Operation Pass is available for free until October 7, though the paid premium version of the pass doesn't expire and can be worked towards after that date.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, developer Halo Studios added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-update-brings-back-something-missing-for-15-years/1100-6533677/" data-ref-id="1100-6533677">Falcon to Halo Infinite as part of its Fall Update 2025</a>, a flying vehicle that last appeared in Halo: Reach. That update additionally added a new weapon, the Vestige Carbine, that is in some ways similar to Halo: Reach's Needle Rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the next entry in the Halo franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">Microsoft has confirmed multiple new Halo games</a> are in the works but haven't shared more details. Halo Studios (formerly 343) revealed last year that future games in the series would be built using Unreal Engine 5. Halo Studios has <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/halo-studios-confirms-major-reveal-to-take-place-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased some kind of announcement for later this year</a>, but it remains to be seen what it could be.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June saw Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer allude to a new Halo title in 2026 as part of Xbox's 25th anniversary, stating fans would see "the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning." Many believed Spencer's comments to be referring to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">long-rumored remake of Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.</p>
