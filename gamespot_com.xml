                <p>Through its first seven months, the Trump Administration has made massive cuts to public spending that have affected nearly every area of American life, from weather reporting and disaster response to arts funding. Video games are no exception.</p><p>The administration's sweeping cuts have halted game preservation programs, virtual reality projects, and even game-related public health research. A report from <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Game Developer</a> details some of the efforts affected by the lost funding, from the University of Washington's Game Research Group, which launched in 2024 to "improve the accessibility of critical video games in cultural heritage institutions for educational purposes," to a grant for a program at Arizona State University helping latinx students develop games about climate change.</p><p dir="ltr">Some projects had their funding removed just as they were about to complete. Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor at Michigan State, was developing a program to "reduce issues of Zoom fatigue and other types of gender and race inequities in the games industry related to virtual meetings." A $1.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation's Future of Work program enabled Ratan's work, but the Trump administration rescinded the grant earlier this year, preventing Ratan and his team from accessing the $200,000 they needed to complete the project.</p><p dir="ltr">Ratan and his crew had built a virtual meeting space, designed to be an effective alternative to Zoom. The platform is still accessible by the public, and Ratan intends to publicize more of the program's findings, but it will remain unfinished for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">Other multi-media projects, like the virtual reality game Paccha, have been affected on multiple fronts. Paccha lets players explore the Peruvian Andes as a student archeologist. The loss of funding has halted collaborations with the San Antonio Museum of Art and with inhabitants and workers in the village of Hualcayan, where the game is set. The developers are now hunting for new places to get funding.</p><p dir="ltr">The video game industry helps drive technological development, exploration, and experimentation, Ratan said, so the cuts could have an impact that reaches beyond the games industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"By limiting research in this industry, it is limiting science as a whole," Ratan said. "There's a slightly more direct negative consequence here in hindering progress in the games industry, namely being that progress in the games industry leads to other industries."</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full report at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, which goes into more detail about affected projects.</p><p dir="ltr">In other federal government news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbi-seizes-prominent-nintendo-switch-piracy-site/1100-6533098/" data-ref-id="1100-6533098">FBI has seized a Nintendo Switch piracy site,</a> underlining the company's efforts against piracy.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image: Courtesy of The Strong, Rochester, New York</em></p>

It is the franchise's first 3D platformer since 1999's Donkey Kong 64 and the first one developed by an in-house team since Jungle Beat in 2004. But why Donkey Kong, rather than a more direct Mario Odyssey sequel? And why return to 3D now? An new interview with Bananza's developers has surfaced answers to some of these questions.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Donkey Kong Bananza producer Kenta Motokura explained that Nintendo executive Yoshiaka Koizumi approached the team and asked them to think about making a 3D Donkey Kong. The team then discussed the possibility with Shigeru Miyamoto, who created both the Donkey Kong and Mario series. He emphasized that Kong has "unique actions" like the hand slap featured in Super Smash Bros. Koikumi, who directed Jungle Beat, added that Donkey Kong has long and strong arms, much in contrast to Mario's more modest figure.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza – 21 Minutes Of Official Gameplay | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, one of Mario Odyssey's developers was experimenting with voxels. This is the tech that powers games like Minecraft, where the world is made with bespoke individual shapes the player can manipulate. It even shows up in Super Mario Odyssey as snow in the game's Snow Kingdom and cheese in the Luncheon Kingdom. The combination of these two factors--thinking through Donkey Kong's unique abilities and experimentation with voxel tech--led to the Bananza that we see today.</p><p dir="ltr">To wrap it up, Donkey Kong Bananza producer Kenta Motokura said, "When we realized the compatibility of Donkey Kong's distinctive characteristics, being strong and having these large long arms, and the possibility of voxel technology, we saw that this was a good match that led us to the idea of pursuing destruction as core gameplay in this title."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/" data-ref-id="1100-6532451">Amazon is finally selling the console</a>, but only by invitation.

                <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized control of one of the best-known Nintendo Switch piracy sites. The home page for Nsw2u--which once hosted numerous Switch ROMs--now redirects to a message announcing the site's takedown.</p><p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, the FBI's message notes that Nsw2u was seized as part of a law enforcement operation that involved the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service, a Dutch government agency that handles financial crimes. The warrant for the takedown was issued from a US District Court in Georgia.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't been shy about its increased efforts to combat piracy, especially since the launch of Switch 2 last month. Several users found out the hard way that placing an MIG Switch cartridge inside the Switch 2 led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-put-this-cartridge-in-your-nintendo-switch-2-or-itll-be-banned-from-online/1100-6532574/" data-ref-id="1100-6532574">a permanent ban from going online</a>. The MIG Switch cartridge can hold ROMs from both legal and illegal origins, but Nintendo doesn't seem to be interested in tolerating either source. Once a Switch 2 console is flagged for using a MIG Switch, the ban can't be reversed because the cartridge violates Nintendo's terms of service.</p><p>Perhaps as a warning to other copyright infringers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went the extra mile to track down an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year. That individual was accused of selling hardware hacks and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games.</p><p>In 2020, Switch pirate Gary Bowser was arrested and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-prison/1100-6500590/" data-ref-id="1100-6500590">subsequently sentenced to 40 months in prison</a>. Despite securing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">an early release for good behavior</a>, Bowser is still on the hook for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-claims-his-case-serves-as-a-message-to-other-pirates/1100-6520791/" data-ref-id="1100-6520791">Nintendo's multi-million judgment against him</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">With Monster Hunter Wilds not showing up on Switch 2, players have another option for slaying gigantic creatures on the system, courtesy of Koei Tecmo. There is now a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wild-hearts-s-switch-2/">Wild Hearts S demo</a> available, and save data can be transferred over to the full game when it arrives July 25.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo will let players experience the action-RPG's prologue up to "Minato," according to <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/wild-hearts-s/us/trial/" rel="nofollow ">Koei Tecmo</a>. The short taste of Wild Hearts S will also feature fighting against beasts like Ragetail and Kingtusk. Co-op online and local support is included--even working with players who purchase the full game in the future. What's especially cool here is that <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/wild-hearts-s/us/comparison/" rel="nofollow ">Wild Hearts S bumps up co-op to four players</a>, while the original 2023 game only supported three people. However, there won't be cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wild Hearts Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Hearts originally launched in February 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, the game was published by EA under its EA Originals label, though this Switch 2 version is published by Koei Tecmo (so an EA account won't be needed for multiplayer). The developer behind Wild Hearts S is Omega Force, best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While Wild Hearts S is clearly inspired by the Monster Hunter series, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-6-ways-its-different-from-monster-hunter/1100-6511581/">plenty of ways the game is different</a>. For instance, the game utilizes automatons called Karakuri that let players build blocks to climb as well as create zip lines to quickly get across environments.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts review</a>.</p>
