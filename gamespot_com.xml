                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-zero-company/" data-ref-id="5000-672878">Star Wars: Zero Company</a> will feature a varied roster of characters as part of the main squad, including a Mandalorian, Jedi Padawan, and an astromech droid--but for the main protagonist of Hawks, players will be free to customize that operative. Speaking to GameSpot, Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch revealed that players will have a selection of options to help fine-tune the look of Hawks, ranging from gender and voice through to their species in the Star Wars galaxy.</p><p>"You can live through that character however you want," Foertsch said. "If you want to change the species, you can. If you want to change their voice, you can."</p><p>The driving theme behind Hawks will be their origin story as a former Republic officer and how they're forced to assemble a motley crew to take on a dangerous adversary while the Clone Wars rage on in the background. While Hawks has been designed to have just enough of a personality for players to imprint themselves on, Zero Company's roster of "authored characters" will all have their own distinct backstories and personalities that players will discover as they progress through the game. One of these allies is Tell, a Jedi Padawan on a quest to finish her fallen master's final mission, and there'll also be some friction between the rest of the crew due to natural rivalries and animosity.</p><p>Interestingly, players will be able to strengthen the bonds between these operatives, resulting in powerful synergy skills that can help turn the tide of battle. "With the authored characters, I think something that the team at Bit Reactor has done a really great job of is sort of weaving in the different perspectives that you would expect them to have on the galaxy and the Clone Wars, with this specific story and this adversary that your company is going up against," LucasFilm Games creative executive Kelsey Sharpe added.</p><p>"It's like a little bit of intrigue--the more you know about Star Wars--but also if you don't know Star Wars, just from watching that trailer you kind of see how they bounce off of each other and you go, 'Oh, this isn't the fun times gang that I thought they were,' right?"</p><p>For more on Star Wars: Zero Company, you can check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-reveal-trailer-teases-stealthy-tactics-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/1100-6530939/" data-ref-id="1100-6530939">reveal trailer from Star Wars Celebration Japan</a> and read up on how the developers behind it are looking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-will-be-an-approachable-tactics-game-but-hardcore-fans-will-be-catered-to/1100-6530935/" data-ref-id="1100-6530935">create an approachable entry in the tactics genre</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After being teased earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company was officially revealed at Star Wars Celebration Japan on Saturday. The cinematic trailer for the game introduced the primary cast of Zero Company: a group of covert specialists who players will control in this turn-based tactics game. Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games, Star Wars: Zero Company will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxnRaZ6slU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, players will step into the shoes of former Republic officer Hawks, who leads a motley crew of specialists behind enemy lines. Some of the characters here include a Clonetrooper, a Jedi Knight, and a Mandalorian, all of whom are original characters created for the game. Bit Reactor says that players will embark on a campaign of tactical operations and investigations in Zero Company, and between missions, they can develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through their network of informants.</p><p dir="ltr">Customization appears to be a big part of the game, as not only can the appearance and combat class of the protagonist Hawks be altered, but recruited operatives can also be personalized from a wide range of original Star Wars character classes and species. For the Zero Company cast whom Hawks commands, Bit Reactor refers to these allies as "Authored Characters" who players can interact and forge strong bonds with. Doing this will in turn unlock combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay-design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press statement. "It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p><p>Star Wars Zero Company is one of several Star Wars games currently in development. Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-shooting-for-2026-launch-report/1100-6515546/">Star Wars: Eclipse</a> all the way back in 2021, Respawn is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-3-coming-actor-says/1100-6517959/">Star Wars Jedi threequel</a>, and Skydance New Media is also working on a mystery Star Wars game.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy IX is one of the best games in the franchise. It’s often overshadowed by other in the series, but its cast of memorable characters, emotional storyline, and fantastic combat earned it universal acclaim when it hit PlayStation in 2000. To celebrate its 25th anniversary, you can now preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1MTMKPT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX Soundtrack Vinyl</a> ahead of its July 18 release.

                <p>Remember the '90s? Epic Games sure does, and the company channeled that totally radical decade with a new ad promoting the new Slurp Rush map for Fortnite Reload. Featuring the talents of Eric Andre and Kyle Mooney, the ad is an homage to those commercials from the 1990s that were trying to sell disgusting sugary beverages and snacks to kids.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Etg4ptsgB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Etg4ptsgB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The defunct soft drink Surge, which was advertised in the late '90s with the tagline <a href="https://youtu.be/8vd2PAQdwaA?si=E5K1f7vMoyQep8lb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Feed the Rush,"</a> is a specific target of parody here, but this type of ad was very common throughout that whole decade for pretty much anything that was aimed at kids, including those sugar-filled drinks and candy (like <a href="https://youtu.be/H7KNcfrhyzw?si=RMonwRpHJ_L9dEFA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gushers</a>), as well as toys.</p><p>The reason for this ad's existence is to promote Fortnite's Reload mode, a battle royale mode which allows players to respawn automatically as long as one member of their team is alive, and takes place on relatively small islands that are based on past chapters of the main Fortnite battle royale. Earlier this week, Reload launched its third map, Slurp Rush, which is based on the Chapter 2 island. To celebrate the launch, Slurp Rush is the only Reload map you can play on right now, but after this period of exclusivity ends it will rotate every half-hour along with the existing two maps.</p><p>Reload, which was released last summer after a very brief development period, has firmly established itself as Fortnite's second-most-popular mode, far outpacing the player counts for the permanent OG mode that launched in December.</p><p>April has been a busy month for Fortnite between the Slurp Rush launch and the beginning of Sabrina Carpenter season in Fortnite Festival last week. But just wait--things are about to get even wilder in May as we look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-start-date-star-wars-battle-pass-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6530938/" data-ref-id="1100-6530938">the heavily-rumored Star Wars season</a> that is expected to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration in Japan on Saturday.</p>
