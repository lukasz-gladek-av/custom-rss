                <p>In August, reports emerged that Microsoft had paused development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contraband/" data-ref-id="5000-533229">Contraband</a>, a co-op smuggler game from Just Cause developer Avalanche. At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cancels-xbox-game-pass-day-one-release-contraband/1100-6533776/" data-ref-id="1100-6533776">put a "hold" on production</a> rather than a full cancellation. But now, Contraband's fate appears to be sealed as mass layoffs at Avalanche have resulted in the closure of its Liverpool studio.</p><p>Avalanche announced the news <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its official site</a>, and disclosed that it means 31 developers are losing their jobs. Per United Kingdom labor laws, Avalanche initiated "<a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a collective consultation process</a>" in September before moving ahead with the layoffs and closing the studio. However, the rest of the company remains intact.</p><p>"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project," reads the message from Avalanche. "We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group. Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities."</p><p>Contraband was initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/contraband-announced-from-avalanche-studios-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/1100-6492801/" data-ref-id="1100-6492801">announced during an Xbox E3 presentation</a> in 2021. At the time, it was touted as a AAA game set in the 1970s in the fictional country of Bayan. It wasn't the only long-term game that was shuttered by Microsoft this year. Rare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everwild/" data-ref-id="5000-504763">Everwild</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/perfect-dark/" data-ref-id="5000-523746">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a> were all casualties of a purge of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">9,000 people, including Xbox employees</a>.</p><p>A recent report suggested that Microsoft's struggles to find its footing may be due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">sky-high profit goals</a> that have resulted in multiple waves of layoffs at the company.</p>

                <p>From a distance, the new twelve-sided tower rising in Phoenix’s Arts District looks like it belongs in a futuristic cityscape--or maybe in the middle of a very enthusiastic geometry lesson. However, ask the designers and they'll tell you there's a wink and a nod to a certain beloved racing game: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart</a>.</p><p>"To build buildings that are unique that people stop and say, 'Hey, what is that?' I think is important to any downtown," said Zac Cohen, creative director at Räkkhaus, the architectural firm behind the project, to <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/mario-kart-inspired-apartment-complex-opening-downtown-phoenix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fox 10 in Phoenix</a>. In other words: If you think this building looks quirky now, just wait until you learn what inspired it.</p><p>The complex takes its name from a famously chaotic, candy-colored racetrack known for sending players plummeting into the void, Rainbow Road. Obviously, you won't see any characters or trademarked symbols on the exterior--a strategic choice, given a certain company's well-known legal enthusiasm--but the references are there if you know where to look and if you look hard enough. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUH7rDlnU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_BUH7rDlnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"One of them is that it's a 12-sided building, which represents the twists and turns of the track," he explained. "As you progress up, you level up with each floor." Even the window insets flash a spectrum of colors, a subtle nod to the kaleidoscopic visuals of the legendary course.</p><p>"The windows are obviously very dramatic; they are angled in different ways to provide sort of a twisting motion," Cohen said. "When you're looking at the building from downstairs, it almost appears to move." That sense of motion extends to the ground level, where public art elements like bike racks and benches trace the flowing geometry of Rainbow Road. A patterned sidewalk wrap will continue the motif around the block, creating a walkable ribbon of color that locals could recognize even without any game logos.</p><p>Inside, the mixed-use complex offers a public fitness area, an indoor-outdoor restaurant, and 36 apartment units, with rents starting at just over $1,900 per month. After 16 months of construction, the project opens on December 1, and Cohen hopes it will energize the neighborhood.</p><p>"We were hoping to design something fun and playful and representative of the arts in the arts district," he said. "There's a surprising lack of art-focused business here, so we wanted to be the catalyst for higher design."</p><p>If you don't live in Phoenix and/or aren't looking to move, you can still enjoy Rainbow Road like the rest of us: by playing Mario Kart World. The game was nominated for a few categories at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a>, and we'll find out if it wins in just a few weeks.</p>

                <p>Once again, Activision has reimagined one of Call of Duty's most iconic maps, Nuketown, and it's launching on November 20 for Black Ops 7. Now, Activision has released a new trailer dedicated to the map, which shows off its new look.</p><p>The new version is called <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Nuketown_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuketown 2025</a>, and as you can see in the trailer, the map appears to be based on the same Nuketown 2025 from Black Ops 2. This makes sense as Black Ops 7 is a sequel to Black Ops 2. Whereas the original version of Nuketown from 2010's Black Ops was based on a '50s theme, this newest iteration has a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-maps-modes-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"retro-futuristic" vibe </a> that imagines what people thought the "neighborhood of the future" could look like.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Nuketown 2025 Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>A key gameplay difference for Nuketown 2025 in Black Ops 7 is that the game features wall-jumping, which affords players new ways to get around the map. Nuketown is a small-size map known for its fast and frenetic action, and with wall-jumping now in play, things might get even more hectic.</p><p>Nuketown has seen a number of updates and revisions over the years. Black Ops 6 also brought back Nuketown and offered multiple variations of it, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-6-patch-notes-detail-weapon-buffs-and-bug-fixes-for-bo6-and-warzone/2900-7124/" data-ref-id="2900-7124">"Boo-town" for Halloween</a> and a trippy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-iconic-nuketown-map-gets-a-4-20-makeover-soon-in-black-ops-6/1100-6530460/" data-ref-id="1100-6530460">"Blaze Town" makeover for 4/20.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch has announced that <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame will be available to everyone</a> starting November 21. Currently, players have to complete the campaign to unlock it.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and, in a break from tradition, Activision's first-weekend social media post about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any mention of how the game is performing compared to past releases. </a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">GameSpot's Black Ops 7 review</a>.
