                <p dir="ltr">Sony has had no problem remastering games for PS5, whether that's Demon's Souls at launch or even The Last of Us: Part II Remastered last year. However, Bloodborne continues to go untouched and still hasn't received a PC port. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida</a> has a theory about why that might be.</p><p dir="ltr">Appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Yoshida admitted that he gets more questions about Bloodbourne on social media than almost any other game. While Yoshida isn't employed at Sony any longer, he still offered up his thoughts on why a remaster hasn't happened, per <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1879721711568060488?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X user Shinobi602</a>. "[Hidetaka] Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created," Yoshida said. "So I think he is interested but he's so successful and so busy, so he can not do it himself. But he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. So that's my theory and the PlayStation team respects his wish."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1879721711568060488?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Shuhei Yoshida talks about Bloodborne and why he thinks Sony hasn't done anything with it yet:<br>"Miyazaki-san really really loved Bloodborne, what he created.

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida left the company recently, and he has been sharing some thoughts on the game industry and the PlayStation brand, such as why the PlayStation Vita trailed behind in popularity with competitors like the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In a new interview, he said that there was a combination of factors that lead the Vita to sell poorly. One reason was its proprietary memory cards. They were incredibly expensive and just added more costs for the consumer. While the PSP had the proprietary memory sticks, players were also able to use micro SD cards with an adapter.</p><p>In addition to the beautiful OLED screen, the Vita also had a back touchpad. While it provided some clever mechanics and gimmicks for some games, it was ultimately unnecessary. Both the OLED screen and touchpad further contributed to costs. One feature that was removed from the final product was a video-out option, which was present in the development kit version.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jMsGB2PItes" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Game developers would be able to use it in order to connect to a screen, but it was removed in order to reduce some costs. Ironically, the PSP had a video out option, which let players connect their device to a TV or another external display.</p><p>However, Yoshida said that the Vita's failure came down to the fact that Sony didn't have enough bandwidth to support both the Vita and PS3 concurrently, especially with the PS4 on the horizon. "I think the biggest reason Vita didn’t do as well as we had hoped was we had to split all our efforts and resources into two different platforms," Yoshida explained. "We didn’t have that resource."</p><p>Sony is back in the handheld market, but with a different approach. The PlayStation Portal is only a remote-play device, but Sony is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/" data-ref-id="1100-6528023">reportedly working on a PS5 handheld</a> that would compete with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2</a> and Steam Deck.</p><p>In the same interview, Yoshida theorized that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">too busy to remaster Bloodborne</a>, as From Software's next project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo finally, formally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">took the wraps off the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, giving us our first official look at the new Joy-Con controllers, a new Mario Kart game, and more. But the company also gave us a glimpse at how the size compares to the older Switch system.</p><p>A comparison on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official site</a> shows the two consoles side-by-side, and sure enough, the Switch 2 looks noticeably larger, but still approximately the same size as other handheld devices like the original Switch or Steam Deck. The bezel also appears smaller, which increases the screen real estate. A recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">recent leak</a> from accessory manufacturer Genki suggested the Switch 2 would be about one inch wider and a half-inch taller, with a 1-inch increase in screen size. While the side-by-side comparison on the official site may not be intended as an exact 1:1 representation, it looks like it would roughly fit those specs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4428649-switch2sizecomparisonlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4428649" data-ratio="0.3328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4428649-switch2sizecomparisonlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4428649"></a><figcaption>Switch and Switch 2 side-by-side comparison</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4428649-switch2sizecomparisonlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The trailer also made a point to show the larger screen when it popped out from the old Switch profile.
