                <p>The future for single-player games has been a question mark since the rise of multiplayer and live-service titles across the video game industry. But according to a newly released survey from Ampere Analysis, single-player games remain the preference for 56% of gamers.</p><p>Ampere has shared the results of its survey, which had responses from 34,000 players across 22 different markets around the world. The new findings note that interest in single-player games has increased 4% over the last four years, and that there's only a small percentage of women (58%) who favor those titles over men (56%) who share their preferences.</p><p>One of the key findings from this survey suggests that fan interest in single-player games increases with age. Only 49% of younger players between 16-24 preferred single-player, while 64% of gamers age 55-64 favored it. Among gamers 25-34, single-player games were preferred by 56%.</p><p>The report notes that the US has the highest share of gamers who prefer single-player titles with 65%. However, Chinese gamers reportedly have the least interest in single-player games, with only 47% of players saying that they prefer those titles.</p><p>"This data reaffirms that single-player games are absolutely still viable--and sought-after--in the live-service-dominated landscape," said Ampere's senior research manager Louise Wooldridge. "The market favors multiplayer games for their ongoing engagement and monetization, but cracking a finely balanced formula for single-player games can leverage this broad audience appeal. Although most gamers prefer this content to multiplayer experiences, the friendship circle still plays a significant role in game discovery and uptake."</p><p>In recent years, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">canceled a Last of Us multiplayer title</a> to focus on single-player games like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/" data-ref-id="1100-6530174">forcefully pushed back</a> on the notion that single-player titles are dead. The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-remains-committed-to-cutting-edge-single-player-games/1100-6530381/" data-ref-id="1100-6530381">its commitment to single-player games</a> as well.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> proudly displays its influences, and the resemblance to games like Persona is clear across multiple aspects. One of them is the school side of things--it's in the name, after all. While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities. (They don't seem to have an official name, so I'll just call them moons.)</p><p>There's a total of ten exams--the main story continues afterward, but there's a clear cut-off point at the end of week 1. Without further ado, you can find all Demonschool quiz answers below, listed by each corresponding week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_7">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 7</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_6">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 6</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_5">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 5</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_4">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 4</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_3">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 3</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_2">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 2</a></li><li><a href="#Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_1">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 1</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_10">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 10</h2><ul><li>What is my name? - Thomas Vincent</li><li>Do the island and school have the same name? - Yes, they do</li><li>So what in fact is the island's name? - Hemsk</li><li>How many members are needed to form a club? - Four</li><li>Who is the school's dean? - Asatiani</li><li>If you fail in school, where do you go? - Prison</li></ul><p>Your reward is six moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_9">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 9</h2><ul><li>What happens when two demon hunters attack simultaneously? - A combo</li><li>Does every demon hunter have their own special attack? - Yes</li><li>When a demon hunter makes a slight adjustment left or right, what is that called? - Sidestep</li><li>What elements are all demons weak to? - Almighty</li></ul><p>Your reward is four moons.</p><h2 id="Demonschool_Quiz_Answers___Week_8">Demonschool Quiz Answers - Week 8</h2><ul><li>Who runs the island? - Dean Asatiani</li><li>What's the name of the alley shopkeep? - Triops</li><li>Who saved the island from invaders 100 years ago?

                <p>The developers behind the newly launched episodic game Dispatch have weighed in with their thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, saying it might help with production but not creativity.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, AdHoc boss Nick Herman said AI cannot achieve what actors Jeffrey Wright and Aaron Paul did in Dispatch. "He brought something to that character that we weren't expecting. I mean, his performance and Aaron's performance and our whole cast are bringing performances and elevating the material in a way that you're just not going to get [with AI]."</p><p>He added: "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVgX7b1N8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Executive producer Michael Choung went on to say that whatever AdHoc creates, it's "got to be made by people." The studio is "looking at AI" and "monitoring" what it can do to help the studio, but right now the results are not convincing AdHoc to push into AI like other studios are.</p><p>"It seems to be having a lot of trouble trying to get to a 'good enough' spot. And 'good enough' for us is the enemy," he said. "Also we're not getting up every morning and talking to ourselves like, 'Hey, what if we did this with less people? What's the lowest number of people we can use to make this thing?' This is like not anything that we're too concerned with."</p><p>Choung added that he does not judge people and studios for using AI in their processes, but for AdHoc, "It just doesn't make a ton of sense" to use AI right now.</p><p>In other news, PUBG creator Brendan Greene recently made headlines when he said he felt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-says-he-is-really-heartened-about-the-backlash-to-ai-in-gaming/1100-6536304/" data-ref-id="1100-6536304">"really heartened" to see the backlash to AI in gaming.</a> He's not the only person speaking out against the further adoption of AI in gaming, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">a US lawmaker recently called out Call of Duty over AI.</a> One of 2025's most successful games, Arc Raiders, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-use-of-ai-is-good-for-gaming-helldivers-boss-says/1100-6536274/" data-ref-id="1100-6536274">embraced AI.</a></p><p>Dispatch is a $30 episodic adventure game for PS5 and PC developed by a team of people who formerly worked at Telltale and Ubisoft. It released in late October and sold more than 1 million copies in its first 10 days. Choung told GI.biz that Dispatch is on track to reach the games lifetime sales projection in three months, though he did not provide any specific numbers.</p>

                <p>The latest event in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> has an army of Homer Simpsons (Homers Simpson?) overrunning the cel-shaded Springfield Island map, with both an animated short episode and a real-life marketing stunt to promote the occasion.</p><p>Titled "Multiplidiocy," the short (continuing from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-next-update-will-add-giant-donuts-falling-from-the-sky/1100-6536083/" data-ref-id="1100-6536083">last week's donut-fueled event</a>) depicts Bart and Lisa Simpson observing radioactive zombified versions of their dad meandering through the streets before Police Chief Clancy Wiggum mows several of them down with a couple of fancy Fortnite guns.</p><p>The short ends with Lisa and Bart attempting to restore their father, only for a giant, nearly naked Homer to materialize before going on a destructive rampage. This is presumably a setup for next week's Fortnite event.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLwSbv-_EWQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cLwSbv-_EWQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you happened to be in Santa Monica yesterday, you might have seen an actual army of Homer Simpson clones roaming the streets. Video game artist Del Walker shared a video on X showing what looks like an overwhelming number of people in Homer Simpsons suits idling in public. Luckily, these Homers weren't remotely violent like they are in-game.</p><p>"I don't think I can accurately convey how MANY there were," <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1990552149953270259" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walker wrote in a follow-up post</a>, attaching another video of these wandering Homers. Even the <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1990559747221913975" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peely-fied Professor Frink showed up</a> for the stunt.</p><p>The Simpsons mini-season of Fortnite has been a real treat for fans of the long-running cartoon, though it took until last week for the battle royale to include a good number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-added-a-pile-of-absurd-new-simpsons-guns-this-week/1100-6536155/" data-ref-id="1100-6536155">Simpsons-themed weapons like Moe's 5 Gun</a>.</p><p>For those who aren't into the animated sitcom, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-will-have-100-players-on-a-big-map-again-in-chapter-7/1100-6536060/" data-ref-id="1100-6536060">Fortnite will go back to normal</a> (whatever "normal" means for this game) when Chapter 7 begins on November 29. Until then, players can enjoy a good d'oh-pamine rush.</p>
