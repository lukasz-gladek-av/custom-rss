                <p>Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and became a smashing success out of the gate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-becomes-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-in-just-3-days/1100-6529838/" data-ref-id="1100-6529838">selling 8 million copies in three days to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. The launch hasn't gone entirely smoothly, though, as players have reported a number of issues. The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds website</a> lists off some of what's been fixed so far, and there have been many changes.</p><p>Some of the issues that have been fixed so far include the fix for the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not working properly, along with a fix for tutorials being repeatedly shown at the Smithy. Capcom also fixed an issue that could cause the game to force-quit and addressed an issue where the weapon equipment skill would be mistakenly activated when using a mantle.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p dir="ltr">Today marks the 25th anniversary of PS2, the best-selling video game console of all time. Sony released the home system in Japan on March 4, 2000, and one Redditor flew over to Tokyo at that time to buy one.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j395wt/25_years_ago_i_flew_to_japan_to_buy_a_playstation/" rel="nofollow ">On Reddit</a>, user YomReddit shared a post with four pictures showing his adventure to Akihabara in 2000 to pick up a PS2 at launch. The Redditor added that they waited 26 hours in line outside a Tokyo store to grab the Sony system. Previously, YomReddit celebrated the console's 20-year anniversary in a similar manner <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fd96pg/on_this_day_20_years_ago_i_queued_for_26_hours_in/" rel="nofollow ">on Reddit</a>. In the comments, the Redditor noted they were from England and played Japanese games since the PS2 was region-locked.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was originally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1999, according to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">the PlayStation website</a>. A couple of the first games showcased for the system included Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (though it wasn't named this at the time) and Eternal Ring, developed by Elden Ring studio From Software.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 didn't launch in North America until October 26, 2000, while the European release was even later on November 24, 2000. Worldwide launches were not common for consoles or games at that time. Ultimately, over 160 million PS2 systems were sold globally, a record that still stands today. Nintendo DS ended its lifecycle with more than 154 million units sold, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/" data-ref-id="2900-5124">Switch sits at 150 million consoles sold</a>, so Nintendo's hybrid system still has a chance to topple the PS2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-kicks-off-with-nostalgic-ps5-themes-and-the-cranberries/1100-6528157/" data-ref-id="1100-6528157">Sony has also been celebrating PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> recently. For instance, PS5 users got a PS2 theme along with other PlayStation menu looks for a limited time. The original PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with the North American release happening on September 9, 1995.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">While the genre isn't as prolific as it once was, beat-'em-ups still tend to follow in the mold of Final Fight and Streets of Rage: You're a muscle-bound mayor or a martial arts expert or occasionally a mutated turtle, and you roam the streets left-to-right beating up punks and punching trash cans to find turkey dinners. Absolum, the latest from veteran studios behind Streets of Rage 4, promises a fresh roguelike twist alongside an inventive original fantasy setting, and the result is a remarkable blend of influences and mechanics that left me wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum is the first original franchise from Dotemu and its co-developers, Guard Crush Games and Supamonk, and it's immediately clear that the studios have thought deeply about how to breathe new life into the classic formula. While you do still move from left to right taking on bands of assorted enemies as you go, the newly-coined "rogue 'em up" variation means you're expected to fail out of levels and progressively build up your strength, all while discovering branching paths and quests. Imagine Golden Axe meets Dead Cells.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvI172bkKDk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Golden Axe comparison extends to the setting, which is refreshingly fantastical for this genre. Absolum takes place in the world of Talamh, where a magical catastrophe has led to an imperial crackdown on all sources of magic and wizards who wield it. The Sun King Azra is on a brutal campaign to conquer every magical land and snuff out the practice. You're part of a small band of resistance fighters following a mysterious and ethereal mystic Mother who uses a forbidden form of magic. While many fantasy stories can get bogged down in too many proper nouns, the little I've seen so far strikes just the right balance of introducing a few fantasy concepts to pique curiosity without overwhelming the player with loads of lore.</p><p dir="ltr">In my limited preview session, I was able to fight through hordes of Azra goons in a few starting areas, as two of the four characters: Galandra, an agile and acrobatic swordfighter, or Karl, a stout dwarf who lands blows with his fists up-close and a blunderbuss at range. The two fit nicely into their fantasy archetypes--Galandra as a lithe elf that strikes like lightning and Karl as a hearty dwarf who plants himself in the ground--as well as offering some nice differentiation in the gameplay. I found myself gravitating toward Galandra, enjoying every moment I would dash towards enemies to unleash a flurry of melee attacks before finishing with a flip-kick flourish. But that's not to say Karl was any less fun to play, since his gun/melee combo makes him a very versatile fighter. And in moments of interstitial dialogue, the two refer to one another like found family, clueing the audience to a sense of closeness to their tight-knit rebel group.</p><p dir="ltr">Both characters look great, thanks to a hand-drawn art style with chunky inked lines that Dotemu says was inspired by French comic books. The dark fantasy setting also makes excellent use of lighting, from the effects of your spellcasting matriarch to the eerie red glow of enemy soldiers' helmets. This is fantasy, but it carries its own distinct look from traditional swords-and-sandals epics, at times looking almost like a blend of fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics. And the enemies themselves are often beautifully expressive, from goofy little goblins to menacing imperial elites.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps best of all, the roguelike elements blend so seamlessly into a beat-'em-up framework that it's a wonder this hasn't already become a trend. Dotemu says the RPG elements and branching paths are to reward replaying levels, since it recognized from its previous work that beat-'em-up fans like to play through over and over.</p><p dir="ltr">I only got a small taste of that from my limited time with the game, but that slice showed enormous potential. While failing out of a stage in a traditional beat-'em-up can be frustrating--or worse, a silly anachronism that prompts you to insert more quarters--in Absolum it's an opportunity. You can go back to base camp, invest in permanent upgrades, change your loadout, talk with your companions and other rebels to flesh out the story, and then try again.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453664" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453664"></a><figcaption>Galandra and Karl fight a servant of Azra</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453654,1300-4453655,1300-4453656,1300-4453657,1300-4453658,1300-4453659,1300-4453660,1300-4453661,1300-4453662,1300-4453663" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those permanent loadouts let you customize broad aspects of your character like equipping particular special moves, such as a Rising Dragon for Galandra that tosses enemies into the air. Then, exploring the world lets you bind temporary, run-only "rituals" that augment you with, for example, a static shock effect on your combo attack. Successfully clearing a room will often reward you with currency to spend back at camp or rituals to boost your abilities now. The roguelike mechanics help every run feel rewarding and impactful, making progress toward strengthening your character instead of simply challenging you to get good.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum looks to be an inventive blend of game genres, gameplay mechanics, and settings and inspirations. It all just fits together so neatly that its disparate parts feel made for each other. Based on my time so far, I'm eager to play more and to learn more about the world and its characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>

Fallout 76 Season 20: Glow of the Ghoul arrives March 18 as part of the Ghoul Within update. This long-awaited update allows players to become ghouls for the first time.</p><p>"Glow of the Ghoul is all about the Ghouls. This theme is for the mutated, the irradiated, the glowing and the feral of the wasteland," Bethesda said in its announcement.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">allowing players to become a ghoul</a>, the new update adds a variety of toxic-waste-themed items for players to use to deck out their C.A.M.P.s.

In fact, you even benefit from radiation in a lot of different ways," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">Bethesda told GameSpot in an interview</a>. "So that on its own will open up a number of different play styles. So if I benefit from radiation and a lot of players wear power armor to stave off radiation, as a Ghoul, I want to absorb it."</p><p>Bethesda also published a roadmap for Fallout 76's next few months, showing off what's coming in terms of seasonal events and double-XP opportunities. The next big update after Glow of the Ghoul doesn't have a name or any details yet, but it'll be released with Season 21 sometime in June.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680"></a><figcaption>Here's what's next for Fallout 76.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond ongoing support for Fallout 76, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>.
