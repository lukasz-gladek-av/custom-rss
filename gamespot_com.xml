                <p>Just over four years ago, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-acquires-esports-tournament-platform-smashgg/1100-6485077/" data-ref-id="1100-6485077">purchased the esports tournament organizing platform</a> Start.gg, which was then known as Smash.gg before its rebranding. Now, Start.gg has announced that Microsoft no longer owns the site and stated that it will "be returning to its roots as an independent company supporting grassroots and professional esports communities."</p><p>Chris Ogle--the co-founder of Smash.gg--shared the news on <a href="https://blog.start.gg/start-gg-returns-to-its-roots-816f31962d3b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium</a> and thanked Microsoft and Xbox for their support. He also noted that the site will continue with members from the original Smash.gg team alongside "grassroots tournament organizers, and engineers who are passionate about improving the platform for the communities we support."</p><p>One of the biggest changes going forward is that starting on February 14, Start.gg will be charging a registration fee to support the expenses of running the site. In addition to making that change for the sustainability of the business, Start.gg will be upgrading its user interface and tournament support.</p><p>"Since our inception back in 2015, our goal has always been to foster esports communities around the games people love to play," wrote Ogle. "This goal remains at the heart of everything we do, and we look forward to continuing our journey with you."</p><p>Despite some downward trends in the gaming industry, esports remain popular. Last year's Evo 2024 was officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">the largest esports competition ever</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2025-lineup-includes-street-fighter-6-marvel-vs-capcom-2-and-the-next-fatal-fury/1100-6528830/" data-ref-id="1100-6528830">Evo 2025</a> will look to maintain that momentum when it returns to Las Vegas between August 1-3.</p>
