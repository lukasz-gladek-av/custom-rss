                <p>Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.</p><p>CEO Dave Baszucki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, "We would. I think we would have to do that."</p><p>It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding "loot boxes and kid gambling," so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.</p><p>Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it," he explained.</p><p>Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no "house" setting the odds.</p><p>Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.</p><p><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN</a> to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.</p><p>Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards/kxgameawards-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.</p><p>Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox. His response was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-ceo-responds-to-child-predator-concerns-poorly/1100-6536445/" data-ref-id="1100-6536445">not what many people wanted to hear.</a></p><p><em>Thumbnail image from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13529953420/Money-Race" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Money Race game</a>.</em></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> may have been overshadowed by the games that followed it this year, but it just took home two awards from the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia. While accepting his wins, the game's leading boss Ryozo Tsujimoto shared his conviction that Monster Hunter is still popular among players and he doesn't see any need for the franchise to stop.</p><p>"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IPs.'"</p><p>There was a live-action Monster Hunter movie in 2020 from director Paul W. S. Anderson and actress Milla Jovovich, the husband-and-wife team behind the first six Resident Evil films. However, Monster Hunter's dismal $47.9 million worldwide box office has seemingly killed any prospect of a sequel.</p><p> Tsujimoto didn't offer any specific updates regarding new Monster Hunter titles, but he reiterated that Monster Hunter Wilds will still be getting updates.</p><p>"Monster Hunter has the characteristics of a title that gets regular updates, but player opinions were very helpful during the update process," wrote Tsujimoto. "And in order to make Monster Hunter Wilds better, the fans’ voices gave us power. There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best."</p><p>During an earnings call for investors in April, Capcom claimed that Monster Hunter Wild's sharp fall-off in sales be address after the first month may have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">due to the high price of a PS5</a>. Earlier this year, Capcom added a special collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-new-update-adds-final-fantasy-14-jobs-and-more/1100-6535012/" data-ref-id="1100-6535012">Final Fantasy 16 and Monster Hunter X</a> , which introduced FF16 weapons, creatures and more into Monster Hunter.</p>
