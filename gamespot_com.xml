                <p>Double Fine's next game is out in October, but beyond that, don't expect to see the studio announce Psychonauts 3 or Brutal Legend 2 in the near-future. Studio development chief Tim Schafer recently spoke about what's next for the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/">after it launches its puzzle-adventure game Keeper</a>, and he confirmed that the studio has multiple original IP in development.</p><p>"I'm working on other stuff," Schafer said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-rules-out-more-sequels-for-now-so-you-can-forget-about-brtal-legend-2-and-psychonauts-3" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "The studio is doing multiple projects right now, and they're all original IPs, because we did Psychonauts 2 and that will hold us for sequels for a while."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Development on Keeper is being led by Double Fine's Lee Petty, and this allowed Schafer to focus his efforts on these new projects. That doesn't mean that we'll <em>never </em>see a Psychonauts threequel--after all, the game between the first and second games was 16 years--or another Brutal Legend game, but for now, the developer is interested in creating brand-new games instead. Back in June, Schafer also commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psychonauts-3-isnt-in-development-right-now-double-fine-confirms/1100-6515614/">how he was developing new games instead of Psychonauts 3</a>.</p><p>While Brutal Legend 2 looks unlikely for now, the game did experience a surge in activity recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-fine-paid-tribute-to-ozzy-osbourne-by-giving-away-brutal-legend-for-666-minutes/1100-6533408/">as Double Fine gave the game away for a devilish 666 minutes</a> to honor the passing of the Guardian of Metal, Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne.</p><p>Double Fine's Keeper will launch on October 17 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/keeper-official-announce-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025/2300-6466106/">and in case you missed the reveal trailer</a>, the game revolves around a a long-forgotten lighthouse and a plucky seabird embarking on a grand adventure.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Advance Wars: Dual Strike is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, August 22, 2025. Below, we revisit the user-generated-content features of the game that were ahead of their time.</em></p><p>The rain drenched my infantryman's helmet as he marched forward. He could barely make out the jagged silhouettes of the grey buildings 100 feet ahead, but it would only be a moment until he reached them. Or so he thought--until the ambush fell. Tanks, recon trucks, and bazooka-wielding foot soldiers poured out of the fog and into my trenches, cutting through my defenses before I could even get my bearings.</p><p>For me, Advance Wars: Dual Strike was a grid-based chess match where every piece could explode, but the single-player campaign felt like squaring off against a row of toddlers still figuring out how pawns worked. The missions were charming, but I wanted something sharper. Dual Strike's other modes, especially Versus, were where the real battlefields waited, ready for me to customize my way into intense engagements--including horrific defeats like the one I just described. This mode was both a canvas for my tactical creativity and an early sign of where the game industry would go in the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg"></figure><p>I was barely 12 years old when I first shoved the Dual Strike cartridge into my Nintendo DS. Even then, I knew I wanted strategy, not just spectacle. I'd already poured dozens of hours into Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, carefully ensuring every character survived the campaign. I liked the pressure, the mental math of predicting enemy movements three turns ahead. I was also more than familiar with the bright battlefields and deceptively complicated tactics of earlier Advance Wars games.</p><p>But those early missions across Omega Land? They didn't exactly test my mettle. Even at higher difficulty settings, I could route the Black Hole Army without much of a plan. The introduction of CO skills--special powers like giving units a second turn or buffing their attacks--was fun at first, but it felt like cheating. Omega Land would always be safe as long as Max and I stood watch. I craved scenarios where I wasn't the unstoppable force.</p><p>That's when I spent time with Dual Strike's other modes, including the War Room and, most importantly, Versus mode. Versus was my laboratory. Here, I could disable Max's abilities, strip away my enemy's usual restraints, and see what I was really made of. I'd set the weather to a downpour, throw in dense fog so I couldn't see beyond a few tiles, and pit myself against my most respected rival--Hawke--on a map that demanded mastery of all three battlefronts: air, land, and sea.</p><p>Once the match began, there was no hand-holding. It was pure tactics. Every turn was a test: What units should I build? Where should I send them? Which front should I reinforce, and which should I risk leaving vulnerable? Sometimes the game settled into a tense stalemate, each of us probing for weaknesses while building up our forces. Other times, it became a frantic race to outmaneuver the other before the tide of battle turned. And yes--more times than I'd like to admit, my entire army was steamrolled into the dirt.</p><p>It wasn't unlike Garry Kasparov's famous chess matches against IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s--me, the human mind, versus an unflinching machine that never made an emotional move. Except in this match, Deep Blue could churn out an endless supply of bomb-dropping bishops.</p><p>What kept me coming back wasn't just winning. It was the process of working through each scenario's puzzle. Defending a capture point against an overwhelming air assault. Outmaneuvering infantry hidden in dense forests. Timing a naval invasion to coincide with an armored push on the opposite flank. The game rewarded patience and punished arrogance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg"></figure><p>And when I got bored of the game's prebuilt challenges? I made my own. Dual Strike's map editor was a treasure trove. I'd design elaborate island chains where naval control decided the war, or create resource-starved wastelands that forced both sides to make desperate, high-stakes gambles. Sometimes I'd stack the deck against myself on purpose--giving the AI extra funds, advantageous terrain, or even a head start in unit production--just to see if I could claw my way back from the brink.</p><p>There was a special satisfaction in winning those battles. Not because the game told me I was good, but because I knew I had beaten something I built to be unfair. It was like crafting my own tortuous obstacle course and then daring myself to survive it.</p><p>The War Room offered its own brand of joy. These standalone missions were more polished than my homemade ones but still gave me freedom in how to approach them. I'd replay certain maps over and over to test new CO pairings and figure out the absolute most efficient way to dismantle the enemy's plan.</p><p>Looking back, I realize Dual Strike made me comfortable with failure--because I failed a lot--and it made the eventual victories that much sweeter. It also planted the seed of creativity in my mind. This edition of Advance Wars was one of the few games, and one for DS no less, that offered user-generated content tools decades before they would shape the future of gaming. That early experience is part of why creation tools--like Fortnite Creative or Battlefield Portal--have become a central focus of my career. One of the greatest ways to empower players is to give them the tools to build the experiences they want.</p><p>Even now, I gravitate toward that same custom-built chaos when I revisit Advance Wars: Dual Strike. The campaigns are fun for nostalgia's sake, but I'm happiest when I'm staring down a near-impossible map I've cobbled together, wondering if I've created a monster I can't beat. The rain is still falling. The fog is still thick. Hawke is still somewhere out there in the mist. And he's probably going to beat me.</p>

                <p>Unlike past Call of Duty games, this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will not allow players to choose a difficulty level <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">for the campaign</a>. Associate creative director Miles Leslie said that the difficulty scale for Black Ops 7 is "baked in" as opposed to being something a player can choose.</p><p>The reason for this comes down to how Black Ops 7's campaign can be played in co-op.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"We've built it for solo or four-player squads as well. You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players," Leslie told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>For players who enjoy a solo experience, Leslie said, "We're not forgetting about you; we love you." However, Black Ops 7's campaign was designed to be a "social experience."</p><p>"We want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well," Leslie said.</p><p>Call of Duty's difficulty levels over the years have included things like Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran, along with a super-challenging Realism mode.</p><p>For Black Ops 7, the campaign difficulty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">will scale when playing co-op</a>, meaning partying up with friends doesn't necessarily make it easier, and teamwork is needed to get through missions.</p><p>Another thing that's new for Black Ops 7's campaign is how XP progression from the campaign is connected to multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. Additionally, Black Ops 7's campaign closes with a mission called "Avalon Endgame," which is described as a "brand-new, replayable experience where you and your squad will need to survive overwhelming odds, adapt under pressure, and break the rules of what you thought a Black Ops campaign could be."</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta will be held in October. </a>The game is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, and PC, and it'll be included with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Battlestate Games has been developing its intense first-person tactical shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape From Tarkov</a> since 2012. Although the closed beta debuted in 2017, players had no idea when to expect the full release. Now, Battlestate Games has shared a new live-action Escape From Tarkov trailer that confirms its exit from early access this fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpeLk_OJ9-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The November 15 release date was revealed in the closing seconds of the video above. Studio head Nikita Buyanov subsequently confirmed the date on his X account.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">15.11.2025<br>1.0 release<br>Let’s gooooooo!</p>  — Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Very little was shared about what will be included in Escape From Tarkov version 1.0. Presumably it will have some story content as well as refined maps, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. But absent any firm details from Battlestate Games, we can only speculate.</p><p>Battlestate Games has kept a community of Escape From Tarkov players together for over eight years. However, there have been some issues that caused friction between the studio and its fans. After releasing a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC, Battlestate Games released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p><p>Escape From Tarkov is only available to play on PC and can be found on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
