                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> fans can look forward to a new addition to the roster later this month, with the arrival of Wuyang. The new support-class hero looks like he'd fight right into the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and this new gameplay trailer for the character shows how he uses unique water-based abilities to disrupt enemies while also protecting his allies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6ZEN5MVJaU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C6ZEN5MVJaU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wuyang will officially debut in Season 18 of Overwatch 2 when it kicks off on August 26, but players can also take him for a spin in a Hero Trial from August 14-18. Blizzard has also confirmed the abilities that Wuyang can wield in combat and his perks, and it looks like he's designed to be a mobile medic. Here's a closer look at his skills.</p><h2>Wuyang Abilities</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549244" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549244"></a><figcaption>Wuyang</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549245,1300-4549246,1300-4549247,1300-4549248,1300-4549249" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><h3>Xuanwu Staff</h3><p><strong>Primary attack:</strong> Fire a damaging Water Orb.

                <p dir="ltr">Watch out for the Benzies family in Schedule 1, as the rival cartel has been introduced to the game for players on the beta branch. In addition, the patch notes reveal more that's been added to the drug-dealing title. A vehicle called the Hotbox and a pump shotgun can now be found within the game, too, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer TVGS announced the rollout of the Schedule 1 cartel update for beta players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. It's noted that you won't interact with the Benzies family until unlocking "a few customers in Westville." After that, expect to make some deals with the family as well as face some ambushes and dealer robbings. After finishing the storyline with the Benzies crew, Schedule 1 players can purchase Hyland Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">The Schedule 1 update also alters how new regions become available to players. The cartel influence level has to be lowered to a certain threshold before moving on to another area, per the patch notes. TVGS apologized to the fanbase that this patch has taken longer than expected, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/">Schedule 1 players voted for the cartel update</a> over other options in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Schedule 1 launched in March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/">seeing huge success on Steam</a> with over 111,000 concurrent players at the time. The game hit an all-time peak of 459,075 concurrent players on Steam in April, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/#3m" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. Schedule 1 had just over 11,400 concurrent players on Valve's platform at the time of publication.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the v0.4.0 open beta are below:</p><h4 dir="ltr">Additions</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point. You will first encounter them once you have unlocked a few customers in Westville.

                <p>Developers at Arkane Studios in France have called on their parent company, Microsoft, to stop supporting Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza, which a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UN Special Committee</a> said was "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> published online (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>) is addressed to the "heads of Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming and the overall Microsoft group." It says that the ongoing situation in Gaza and Microsoft's work with Israel could "affect our reputation and work" and asks Microsoft to take the "appropriate measure" to resolve it. It joins the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which has set Microsoft as a priority target of its boycott. BDS specifically mentions Microsoft's gaming division and Game Pass among its boycott targets.</p><p>"We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza," the letter continues. "Moreover, we think it's our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise.</p><p>"In a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs."</p><p>The letter cites reporting from the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/" rel="nofollow ">Associated Press</a> showing Microsoft has collaborated with the Israeli military through its cloud and Azure services, as well as its AI systems that have been used to define bombing targets. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" rel="nofollow ">The Guardian</a> also found that Israel's military surveillance agency has used Azure to extensively monitor Palestinians. Microsoft denied any knowledge of this use, and said it did not "build or consult" with Israel surveillance, but has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/microsoft-israeli-military-azure-cloud-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">opened an internal investigation</a> regardling the claims.</p><p>Arkane said it is joining an existing petition from Microsoft employees called No Azure for Apartheid, which has laid out specific demands including: termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli Occupation Forces, transparent disclosure of ties to the Israeli military including an independent and public audit of its contracts and services, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and free speech and safety for pro-Palestinian employees. Microsoft employees and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/microsoft-investors-prod-company-over-work-with-israeli-military?sref=uE15RiYa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shareholders</a> began pressuring Microsoft for increased transparency in spring. In May, an employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a keynote with a "Free Palestine" protest.</p><p>For its part, in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post in May</a> Microsoft claimed that it conducted both internal and external reviews and "found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." At the same time, though, it acknowledged that it does not have visibility into how customers use its software.</p><p>Since the start of the BDS boycott, the situation in Gaza has worsened. A <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">United Nations report</a> published in late July says that food security experts warn of a "worst-case scenario of famine" unfolding in the region, as "widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease" are driving an increase in hunger-related deaths. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-leader-claims-no-one-in-gaza-is-starving-data-and-witnesses-disagree" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claimed</a>, "There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza."</p><p>Arkane is the Microsoft studio behind games like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop. Its current project is an adaptation of Marvel's vampire hunter Blade, though we haven't seen much of the game yet. The studio said in 2023 that it was going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-new-blade-game-wont-be-discussed-for-a-while/1100-6519831/" data-ref-id="1100-6519831">"stay silent for a while."</a></p>

                <p>Pearl Abyss announced today during its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" rel="nofollow ">latest earnings</a> call that its upcoming action-adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-desert/">Crimson Desert</a> has been delayed to Q1 2026. The game had already been delayed once before, after initially being planned for 2021 before getting bumped to the latter half of this year. During the investors call, Pearl Abyss also took the time to explain why a second delay has taken place, noting that "longer-than-expected timelines" left them with little choice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voiceovers, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release," the developer explained, noting that it still plans to feature an open-world build of the game at Gamescom and PAX West this month. It went on to say that the delay is "due to longer-than-expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations … Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at ensuring success on a meaningful scale."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Crimson Desert Is For Fighting Game Sickos Like Me</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Pearl Abyss didn't have any more specific details on a release date than Q1 2026, but said that a release date reveal shouldn't be expected at Gamescom. It plans to announce a release date at a "more appropriate time based on business considerations."</p><p dir="ltr">Crimson Desert was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-revealed-releases-in-2021/1100-6485399/">initially announced back in 2020</a>, conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss' MMO Black Desert Online, but over the course of its development it was decided it would be a single-player game instead. If you're curious about what Crimson Desert looks like in action, GameSpot attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crimson-desert-might-have-the-most-realistic-in-game-physics-ive-ever-seen/1100-6530297/">hands-off preview</a> earlier this year, coming away particularly impressed with its in-game physics.</p>
