Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo.</p><p>Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Samus Amiibo Unlocks</p>
      </div>
<p>The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game.</p><p>While the Samus Amiibo adds the music, the Vi-O-La Amiibo unlocks the skin options for the Vi-O-La. The Sylux Amiibo unlocks the extended cutscenes (after you complete the game), but you can also get those by getting 100% scanning.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is out now for Switch and Switch 2. You can also find GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/" data-ref-id="1900-6418446">Metroid Prime 4 review</a> to see what we thought of it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a> have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist.</p><p dir="ltr">That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2NcnBVZ4o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S_2NcnBVZ4o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.</p><p dir="ltr">Using a full day/night cycle, Hello Sunshine will dynamically adjust your mission parameters as each day progresses. Early in the morning, the abusive sun is in a different point in the sky than it'll be later in the evening, causing you to mindfully stay behind, ahead of, or perhaps to one side of the giant robot.</p><p dir="ltr">During these daytime hours, the pacing is made to feel hurried. You can head out of the safe shadow, but not for long, as the robot is forever moving onward, with or without you. How long do you spend in a dilapidated building seeking crafting and healing supplies, knowing that you'll need to sprint back through the desert to reunite with your big metal security blanket? You can survive for a short moment in the sun, but it's not long before it starts chipping away at your health. Therefore, you don't want to let the robot get so far ahead that you lose track of it, but sometimes the allure of rare loot or vital health items keeps you two dangerously apart.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the best-laid plans can go awry when those smaller, antagonistic bots show up to slow you down, or push you out of the shadows when you're not careful and well-prepared. Weather events such as sandstorms can also dynamically disrupt your journey, severely limiting your ability to keep your robot in view, despite its gargantuan stature.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of each day you survive, you'll reach a service station, where the robot finally rests--charges, really--and allows you to do the same overnight. It's here that you'll craft items, recycling scraps you've amassed so far to make new clothing, flashlights, and weapons, among other things.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4616369" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4616369"></a><figcaption>Strengthening the bond with your robot companion will be a major part of the story in Hello Sunshine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As much as you can focus on yourself, you can also repair and upgrade the robot. This was my favorite part of the hands-off demo I was part of: seeing how you'll bond with the robot, which at first seems to pay you no mind whatsoever, seemingly unaware of your existence. But as you tend to it, it'll start to take an interest in you. Based on some thematic hints the creators at red Thread Games mentioned in my preview (which I won't spoil here because they joked that maybe they'd said too much already), I expect your bond with your giant companion to grow quite close over the game's hours, which leaves me wondering how much the story will later test that same bond. But these are the emotional beats that would bring the experience all together for me, so I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next, even if it hurts.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind the game teased that there is a lot more to the story and world you'll explore, including multiple biomes, so it won't all be set i nthe desert, as well as online and split-screen co-op elements they weren't ready to talk about in great detail. What they didn't mention yet is a release date, though you can sign up for the free, upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245140/Hello_Sunshine/" rel="nofollow ">Hello Sunshine playtest</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4z_yQE5Xo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.</p><p>As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, "There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse." This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.</p><p>"We built Samson to strike fast and leave a mark," said Sundberg in a statement. "It's a raw, physical story with systems that push back at every turn. This is the start of what Liquid Swords stands for, and the team has delivered something with real teeth. We've come through a heavy cycle of change and sharpened every part of how we work. The entire industry is navigating pressure right now. Samson is our answer to that reality, a focused project built with intent, not excess. This is how we move forward."</p><p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story will be released on PC in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

The big update also overhauls Warzone's perk system, so here we'll highlight all the perks in the game and include some recommended picks for your next match of battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also changes how some of the perks work in Warzone. Popular choices from last year may not be as beneficial this year, while other perks are buffed to be much more viable for Black Ops 7's integration.</p><p dir="ltr">The recommended perks can be great choices whether playing on Warzone's Verdansk or the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-havens-hollow-resurgence-map-and-all-locations/2900-7308/" data-ref-id="2900-7308">Haven's Hollow Resurgence map</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#All_perk_1__blue__options">All perk 1 (blue) options</a><ul><li><a href="#Mountaineer">Mountaineer</a></li><li><a href="#Cold_Blooded">Cold-Blooded</a></li><li><a href="#Grenadier">Grenadier</a></li><li><a href="#Scavenger">Scavenger</a></li><li><a href="#Veteran">Veteran</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_perk_1_options">Best perk 1 options</a></li><li><a href="#All_perk_2__red__options">All perk 2 (red) options</a><ul><li><a href="#Bomb_Squad">Bomb Squad</a></li><li><a href="#Reactive_Armor">Reactive Armor</a></li><li><a href="#Sprinter">Sprinter</a></li><li><a href="#Alertness">Alertness</a></li><li><a href="#Quick_Fix">Quick-Fix</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_perk_2_options">Best perk 2 options</a></li><li><a href="#All_perk_3__yellow__options">All perk 3 (yellow) options</a><ul><li><a href="#Adaptive">Adaptive</a></li><li><a href="#Ghost">Ghost</a></li><li><a href="#Survivor">Survivor</a></li><li><a href="#Tracker">Tracker</a></li><li><a href="#Tempered">Tempered</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_perk_3_options">Best perk 3 options</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_perk_1__blue__options">All perk 1 (blue) options</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616422-warzoneperkslot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616422" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616422-warzoneperkslot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616422"></a><figcaption>Perk 1 slot</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616422-warzoneperkslot1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mountaineer">Mountaineer</h3><p dir="ltr">This perk reduces fall damage and improves climbing with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increases the height before taking critical fall damage by five meters</li><li dir="ltr">Combat Roll mechanic further reduces fall damage by 10% and removes the movement penalty from high falls</li><li dir="ltr">Increases ladder climb speed by 15%</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Cold_Blooded">Cold-Blooded</h3><p dir="ltr">Grants immunity to tracking equipment, targeting systems, and electronic interference with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Immune to thermal optics, weapon targeting systems, heartbeat sensors, phantom signals, scrambling, EMP effects, Tracker, and Alertness</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Grenadier">Grenadier</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves explosive equipment and equipment handling with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Explosive equipment adds a 5-second health regen delay</li><li dir="ltr">Explosive equipment inflicts a 20% movement slow for three seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Throw equipment 15% farther</li><li dir="ltr">See equipment trajectories</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Scavenger">Scavenger</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves ammo and resource acquisition with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dead opponents drop a pack containing additional ammo, equipment, plates, and cash</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Veteran">Veteran</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves equipment resistance and long-range weapon handling with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Resistant to flash, concussion, gas, and shock equipment effects</li><li dir="ltr">Immune to Grenadier</li><li dir="ltr">Increases hold-breath duration by five seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Increases flinch resistance by 30%</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perk_1_options">Best perk 1 options</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scavenger</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Scavenger remains a solid choice for a first perk, as you can easily get topped off with ammo, armor plates, and cash by scavenging enemy players. I also think it's always good to have at least one class with this perk in case you need a quick regain after dying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mountaineer</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Mountaineer has been readjusted to make it much more useful.

Bomb Squad is great for aggressive plays, making sure you can see enemy equipment before pushing into buildings, as well as reducing the fire and explosive damage you take.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Alertness</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's always great to have intel on the map, especially when teaming up in trios or squads. Having at least one person in your party run Alertness will help warn you when an enemy has their sights on you.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_perk_3__yellow__options">All perk 3 (yellow) options</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616423-warzoneperk3slot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616423" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616423-warzoneperk3slot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616423"></a><figcaption>Perk slot 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616423-warzoneperk3slot.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Adaptive">Adaptive</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves explosive defense, movement, and handling with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">With plates not full: Gain a 10% movement speed boost</li><li dir="ltr">With plates full: Gain improved ADS speed and sprint-to-fire speed</li><li dir="ltr">Gain an audible warning when near trap equipment</li><li dir="ltr">Traps triggered by the player are delayed</li><li dir="ltr">Gain the ability to reset fuses when throwing back grenades</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ghost">Ghost</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves stealth with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Undetectable by enemy radar pings while moving</li><li dir="ltr">Effects are disabled if stationary for 1.5 seconds or more</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Survivor">Survivor</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves health regeneration, revive speed, and survivability with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">With full armor plates, gain one-hit protection against ballistic weapons</li><li dir="ltr">Health begins regenerating after 4 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Allies revive you faster</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Tracker">Tracker</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves tracking and target acquisition with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Shooting an enemy briefly outlines them based on range</li><li dir="ltr">Automatically ping the enemy who downs you</li><li dir="ltr">Track enemy footprints; when you shoot an enemy, all others can see their footprints for 10 seconds</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Tempered">Tempered</h3><p dir="ltr">Improves armor efficiency with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Refilling armor requires 2 plates instead of 3</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perk_3_options">Best perk 3 options</h2><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, there are a lot of powerful perks stacked in slot 3, so which perk you pick will likely depend on your playstyle. This includes defensive perks that will help keep you alive, and an offensive perk designed for intel and aggressive plays.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Survivor</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This was already a helpful pick in recent seasons of Warzone, but it becomes even more powerful in this new year with BO7's integration. In addition to the health regen and faster revives, it also now protects you from getting one-hit by snipers so long as you're geared up with full plates.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Tracker is the pick for aggressive players looking to hunt their opponents. This will let you track and ping enemies just as before, but now the perk gives the added benefit of also letting your teammates see the enemy footprints after you shoot an enemy. Put some bullets in your opponent, but they are trying to flee? Now, you and your team can work together to track their steps and hunt them down.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's always helpful to have a Ghost class in Warzone, but the perk is very situational. There are some matches where your opponents just aren't calling in a lot of UAVs, and it might be better to have Tracker or Survivor as your third perk. Make at least one Ghost class, and this is something you can switch to if you find there are a lot of UAVs getting activated, or to keep you off the radar in a late-game situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Adaptive</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a brand-new perk that the developer says is designed to allow you to dynamically respond to combat situations. When your armor plates are full, it supports aggressive pushes. When plates are depleted, it grants a constant movement advantage to aid you in repositioning.</p><p dir="ltr">This perk could be really useful in various situations, but it will require some testing to see if the ADS and speed boosts are enough to make this a viable pick, but it's worth trying out to see if you find this beneficial to you.</p>
