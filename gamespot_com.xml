                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-minecraft-competitor-hytale-isnt-canceled-after-all/1100-6536298/" data-ref-id="1100-6536298">purchased all of the rights for Hytale</a> from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.</p><p>On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will retail for $20</a>. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.</p><p>"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."</p><p>Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how far along the modding feature is</a>. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> isn't technically until November 28, but plenty of early deals are available already, including numerous video game discounts. One of the most unique titles you can pick up for cheap right now is Once Upon a Katamari, which is discounted to $30 (was $40). The quirky roll-’em-up series has been a cult classic for decades, and the latest game in the franchise has earned positive reviews for its new spin on familiar gameplay mechanics. This limited-time deal is a great time to add it to your collection. The price cut applies to the PS5 and Switch and is available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Roll+Up+A+Once+Upon+A+Katamari+For+25%25+Off+With+This+Black+Friday+Deal&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-11-21+16%3A46%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-21+16%3A47%3A03&amp;fnarticle_id=6536373&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FLKVgva&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fonce-upon-a-katamari-black-friday-2025-deal%2F1100-6536373%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><div title="6536373 -- Once Upon a Katamari (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5057" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536373 -- Once Upon a Katamari (BF2025)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Once Upon a Katamari (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8SHB29,B0FK8HVR9Y&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$30 (was $40)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the other Katamari games, Once Upon a Katamari kicks off with the King of the Cosmos causing unintentional chaos. As the Prince, it’s up to you to clean up his blunder and restore the universe to its former glory. With over 50 levels spread across nine distinct eras, the Prince has his work cut out for him as he explores the Jurassic Era, Ice Age, historic Japan, and more major moments in history. Outside of the single-player campaign, Once Upon a Katamari also has a four-player mode called "KatamariBall," where everyone competes in a cosmic sports game. </p><p>The standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Once-Upon-Katamari-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FK8HVR9Y?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Once-Upon-Katamari-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FK8SHB29?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> editions include the full base game.

It manages to perfectly capture what has always made Katamari so charming and special--the writing, the humor, the music, the absurdity of it all--and refines it into the best way to experience the series, regardless of if it's your first time playing or if you're a long-time fan," Jessica Cogswell wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/once-upon-a-katamari-review-i-love-mess/1900-6418429/" data-ref-id="1900-6418429">Once Upon a Katamari review</a>.</p><p>One the hunt for more early Black Friday video game deals?
