However, Switch 2 owners were supposed to get the game on October 3. Now, Gearbox Software has delayed the Borderlands 4 Switch 2 port 10 days before its release after citing a need for it to have more time in development.</p><p>Gearbox made the announcement on social media, and wrote that it "did not take this decision lightly." The statement goes on to say that Gearbox is "committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we've fully adjusted our plans."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed.
