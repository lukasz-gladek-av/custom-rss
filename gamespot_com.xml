                <p>The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">numerous developers lost their jobs</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">Microsoft canceled games</a>, and the industry further consolidated with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry.</p><p>Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task.</p><p>"It's a very difficult needle to thread, because on one level, it is a celebration of the industry. But the games are made by incredible developers, and it’s been a challenging period overall. I don't have all the answers about the right way to [address it]."</p><p>Keighley went on to say he feels a "weight" on his shoulders to do more because The Game Awards has such a large platform. But at the same time, Keighley said he understands that people watch the show to see their favorite games get celebrated and get hyped for the news and reveals.</p><p>"How we square that is something that we think a lot about. Some people online think that we're oblivious to it. We're definitely thinking about the right way to represent the industry to the wider world. Do we always get it right? No. It's a very complex situation to figure out exactly what to do," he said.</p><p>People have also criticized The Game Awards (and numerous other entertainment awards shows, for that matter) for not being more heavily focused on the awards themselves, and instead also serving as a marketing events for games. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>"There are many different constituents that tune in," he said. "And it is a balancing act. "There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements."</p><p>Keighley said his take is that the promise of exciting announcements help create a "very wide audience" for who might want to watch the show. More people watching to see the brand-new reveals--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/" data-ref-id="1100-6536779">whatever the heck that scary monolith is</a>--will in turn create increased viewership for when the awards are handed out. Or at least that's how Keighley sees it and explains it, and he shared some anecdotes that back up his claims, to an extent.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Game Awards takes place on Thursday, December 11, beginning at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET, with a pre-show set to begin 30 minutes prior. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 picked up 12 nominations overall, including a nod for Game of the Year, and is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">most-nominated game in the history of the show</a>.</p><p>For more, check out all the categories and nominees below, along with our roundup of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025s-biggest-snubs/2900-7272/" data-ref-id="2900-7272">biggest snubs</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tga-2025-predictions-whats-going-to-happen-at-the-game-awards/2900-7307/" data-ref-id="2900-7307">predictions for what will be announced.</a></p>

                <p>After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the "must-play" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> was not mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, "Seeing Halo here is still surreal." Someone else said, "It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PlayStation 5 - Upcoming Games in 2026 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026.</p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to launch in Fall 2025 before the game was delayed to May 2026 and then again to November 2026. Rockstar has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">pattern of delaying games</a>, but nothing so far has suggested that Rockstar will delay GTA 6 a third time.</p><p>As for Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the original Halo game with modern graphics and numerous other updates and improvements, is set for release at some point in 2026 to mark the franchise's 25th anniversary. There are also rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">new live-service Halo game coming in 2026.</a></p><p>Other games featured in Sony's video include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pragmata/" data-ref-id="5000-513798">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Nioh 3, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem.</a></p>
