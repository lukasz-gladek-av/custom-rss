                <p>Video game crossovers and collabs are nothing new, but in many cases, they are predictable. That is not the case with the latest gaming crossover, as 2K has announced that Borderlands 4 is invading PGA Tour 2K25. These two franchises having the same owner is about all they have in common.</p><p>Season 4 of PGA Tour 2K25 will include a "Mayhem on the Greens" event that brings Borderlands to the golf sim. "Mayhem on the green incoming!!" Borderlands developer Gearbox <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1982862146821337246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said.</a></p><p>The Mayhem on the Greens event begins Wednesday, October 29, but neither 2K Sports nor Gearbox have provided any details about what to expect from it. The teaser art shows a Psycho character wielding a special type of golf club that looks like it was made in the wasteland.</p><p>This won't be the first time that PGA Tour 2K25 features new licensed content, as the game offers a multitude of content for purchase based on real-world brands like Adidas, Sun Day Red, and Barstool Sports.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launched in September and had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">huge opening in the US, setting franchise records.</a> The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">first post-launch paid DLC</a> arrives in November, adding new story missions, bosses, and loot.</p>

                <p>It's been three years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a> was released, and if there's a follow-up game on the horizon then Sony's done a good job keeping it under wraps. It seems like a safe bet that there will eventually be another God of War game, and if there is, Christopher Judge wants it to take place in Egypt.</p><p>Judge--who first rose to fame for starring in Stargate SG-1 as Teal'c--has voiced Kratos since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a> in 2018. The original games set Kratos against the Greek pantheon of gods, while the last two games centered on the Norse gods. For a new title, Judge recently disclosed that he would like to return to some of the Egyptian mythology from Stargate.</p><p>"Because I became best known as Teal'c from Stargate, to go to Egypt would be a completion of my circle," said Judge during his recent appearance at MCM London Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "But whatever is decided--waitâ€¦ if there is another game, I have no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great."</p><p>There have been previous rumors about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/greek-god-of-war-side-story-releasing-this-year-report/1100-6530298/" data-ref-id="1100-6530298">God of War side-story set in Greece</a>, but that project was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">reportedly pushed</a> to 2026. God of War director Cory Barlog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-studios-next-game-reportedly-going-well-may-not-be-a-sci-fi-new-ip/1100-6533167/" data-ref-id="1100-6533167">has hinted at his new game</a> from Sony Santa Monica, but hasn't given any indication it's another title in the franchise.</p><p>In the meantime, Amazon Prime Video is moving forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-showrunner-talks-about-how-the-tv-series-will-be-different-from-the-games/1100-6533477/" data-ref-id="1100-6533477">a live-action God of War series</a>, but has yet to cast any of the major roles.</p>
