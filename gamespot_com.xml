                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a FPS, so shooting people seems like an obvious part of the game. However, there's one player out there who's gotten creative enough with pacifism in multiplayer that they've actually reached prestige without killing an enemy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gosfdl/pacifism_will_always_be_a_legitimate_strategy/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pacifist-whos-already-hit-prestige-without-killing-anyone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, Pilgore1 posted an image showcasing that they hit Prestige 1 in Black Ops 6 with zero eliminations after over 19 hours of playtime. Not only that, but Pilgore1 also has a career winning record of 73-38. So it's not like they are some weak link on teams in Black Ops 6 multiplayer, either.</p><p dir="ltr">Pilgore1 revealed how they help their teammates in Black Ops 6 in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gosfdl/comment/lwkxzym/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments section</a> on the Reddit post. "Hiding while tagging people with Spycam and calling in the 3 UAV streaks," Pilgore1 wrote. "You'd be surprised how much having one person on the team not dying helps you win TDM."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="122251586" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>The release of a new Call of Duty game is almost always one of the best-selling titles in any given year. But since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> debuted on Game Pass on day one of its release, there was some question as to whether this would diminish the title's impact and sales across Xbox Series X|S and other platforms. It's too early to render a final judgment about that, but so far, one analyst says that Black Ops 6 wasn't hurt at all by being on Game Pass.</p><p>"Call of Duty engagement following the release of Black Ops 6 can only be defined by the term 'bonkers,'" Circana analyst Mat Piscatella wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3laottx5tak2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>. "We've yet to see anything like it in our engagement tracking data... There's been an ongoing debate about Game Pass and its impact on sales and it's never been settled because... it depends. Sometimes it helps sales (especially through virality), sometimes it hurts. After two weeks, my take on this one is that it may not have helped, but it also sure didn't hurt."</p><p>According to Activision, Black Ops 6 had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">the highest opening weekend numbers</a> for any game in the franchise among total players, total hours played, and total matches. Treyarch associate creative director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-on-game-pass-helped-bring-back-lapsed-players-activision-boss-says/1100-6527653/" data-ref-id="1100-6527653">Miles Leslie credited Game Pass</a> for the resurgence in interest in the long-running franchise among lapsed players.</p><p>"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long--I've been working on it for 16 years," said Leslie. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p>One of the promises that Microsoft had to make in order to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard was a deal to keep Call of Duty games on PlayStation consoles for at least a decade. Activision hasn't released its sales figures for Black Ops 6 yet, but putting it on Game Pass seems to have accomplished the company's goals for the franchise. At least for now.</p>

                <p>Prime Video's upcoming video game anthology TV series Secret Level features an episode dedicated to Sony's ill-fated multiplayer shooter, Concord. Series creator Tim Miller reflected on the game's struggles in an interview, saying he can't wrap his head around why the game didn't succeed. He also discussed how the Concord episode of Secret Level "turned out really well."</p><p>"There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on Concord," he told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>. "I honestly don't understand why it didn't work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that."</p><p>Secret Level's Concord episode could be the last time Concord appears anywhere in an official capacity, and if that's the case, Miller said he's happy with the episode his team made.</p><p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show, because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters," he said. "If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p><p>Secret Level is an anthology series similar to Miller's previous show, Love, Death &amp; Robots. There are 15 episodes in all, including installments based on franchises like Mega Man, Pac-Man, The Outer Worlds, and PlayStation in general. The series premieres December 10 on Prime Video. The episodes feature the voices of Keanu Reeves, Arnold and Patrick Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Luna, Claudia Doumit, and Merle Dandridge, among others.</p><p>Concord launched in August for PlayStation and PC, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">failed to find an audience</a> and Sony made the dramatic decision to shut the game down and offer refunds. Its developer, Firewalk, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">since closed.</a> Going forward, Sony's management has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-talks-concord-failure-and-the-hard-lessons-learned-from-it/1100-6527647/" data-ref-id="1100-6527647">implemented new procedures to help ensure something like this doesn't happen again. </a></p>
