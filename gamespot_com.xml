                <p>The MMO Defiance, which was shut down in 2021, is coming back to life. For anyone unaware, Defiance was a third-person shooter MMO from Trion Worlds that was developed as a tie-in for the Syfy show of the same name, with events and storylines running across the game and the TV show. It launched in 2013 as a paid game for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, before adopting a free-to-play model and continued to receive updates even after the TV show was canceled in 2015. A new version of the game, Defiance 2050, came out in 2018--but both games shut down servers in 2021. Now, Defiance is attempting a comeback.</p><p>Fawkes, a game company whose mission is "breathing life to old worlds and preserving their legacy," has announced plans to bring Defiance back following a deal with previous rights-owner Gamigo.</p><p>"Even though the TV series was discontinued in 2015 and Gamigo eventually closed the game in 2021, the memories of epic Arkfalls and immersive, post‑apocalyptic battles live on in your hearts," Fawkes said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Jfk8Pt8B4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p1Jfk8Pt8B4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fawkes said it has acquired the license to the "worldwide development and publishing rights" for Defiance and Defiance 2050 on all platforms. The first step in the comeback is relaunching the original game on PC in April 2025.</p><p>"Our relaunch is designed to be a homecoming for those who once fought side by side during legendary Arkfalls. We want you to return to a familiar world that still holds countless memories, and to create new ones with friends both old and new," Fawkes said.</p><p>Should the re-launch go well in April 2025 on PC, Fawkes said it will "explore the possibility" of bringing Defiance back to consoles.</p><p>"We will start small, with a very clean state of the game, with the design and drop we understood you like, and grow from there together with you, bringing the changes that had an impact and leaving behind the ones that didn’t. We are ready to re-build Defiance together with you, Arkhunters," Fawkes said.</p><p>Fans can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fawkes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fawkes Discord</a> channel to stay up to date on the newest developments.</p><p>"Thank you for keeping the flame of Defiance alive all these years. We can't wait to welcome you back into the world of epic battles and unforgettable moments. Get ready to Defy the odds once again!" Fawkes said.</p><p>Fawkes also helped revive the games Shaiya and Last Chaos, and also has the rights to Desert Operations and Wargame 1942.</p>

                <p>Lenovo might not be the first place you’d expect to find DualSense Controllers on sale, but it’s currently the best place to buy models in the Deep Earth lineup. Head over to the retailer and use promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> to get the <a href="https://howl.link/kah0afkv6gzak?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964641119?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volcanic Red</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/4rdw54vgl4q2s?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417963320617?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sterling Silver</a>, or <a href="https://howl.link/c4hsbc2qatcx0?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964545581?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cobalt Blue</a> DualSense for PS5 and PC for just $54 (was $80). That makes them <strong>slightly more affordable than they were during Black Friday</strong>--so if you missed out on those deals and need an extra DualSense or two, now's a great time to pick up one of PlayStation's coolest models.</p><p>While Lenovo is advertising the promo code GAMEON, that one has actually inspired. But using promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> will still let you snag these premium designs for cheap, so make sure to apply the code before finalizing your purchase.</p><p>The Deep Earth lineup might look more premium than the average DualSense, but these are still just your standard DualSense controllers. That means you won’t get the customization features found on the Edge. They still benefit from a built-in microphone, adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a rechargeable battery, making them the ideal choice for most gamers.</p><p>The standard DualSense, unsurprisingly, earned the top spot on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">best PS5 controllers</a>. Check out all three Deep Earth DualSense Controllers below, and read on for details on new and upcoming limited-edition PlayStation 5 controllers.</p><p>It's worth noting that multiple limited-edition DualSense controllers are still available, including the Fortnite and Helldivers 2 models. The <strong><a href="https://howl.link/6gbtrsxgwtoxw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417980022675?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Limited Edition DualSense</a></strong> released last fall and is in stock for $85 at Best Buy. Meanwhile, the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-helldivers-2-limited-edition%3Fclickref%3D1100lAdeZZFi%26emcid%3Dot-ps-456950&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-big-on-three-dualsense-ps5-controllers-cobalt-blue-volcanic-red-and-silver%2F1100-6530075%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Helldivers-themed DualSense</a></strong> released in February as a PlayStation Direct exclusive. PlayStation will open preorders for a new limited-edition DualSense themed around The Last of Us on March 14.

PlayStation released a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DSQQ1P8D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midnight Black DualSense Edge</a></strong> in February. To save some cash on the $200 controller, you can get the white DualSense Edge in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Renewed-5/dp/B0CJGK3B8Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">refurbished premium condition (like new)</a> for $180 at Amazon.

                <p>Paradox Interactive has launched its Chapter 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3486700/Crusader_Kings_III_Chapter_IV/?curator_clanid=36033026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expansion pass for Crusader Kings 3 on PC</a>, the core content being the new Genghis Khan-inspired Khans of the Steppe expansion. The pass also includes other expansions as well, such as Crowns of the World, Coronations, and All Under Heaven, and is currently being sold for $44.</p><p>The Khans of the Steppe expansion is focused on Nomadic life and the rise of the Great Khan. In it, players will be able to manage their herds, migrate across regions, and establish dominance in the Great Steppe. The expansion will also let players learn more about Mongolian history, cultural events, and traditions. Khans of the Steppe is scheduled to release on April 28 and will cost $20 if purchased separately.</p><p>While Khans of the Steppe isn't available until next month, those who purchase the expansion pass can receive the Crowns of the World update immediately. It's a cosmetic-based update that gives players six crowns, four hairstyles, and two beards to customize their rulers further.</p><p>The Coronations event pack will launch sometime between July and September. It includes a new activity called Coronations, which lets players legitimize their rule through grand ceremonies. The All Under Heaven expansion will launch sometime between October and December and will expand the game's current map by 30%, as well as allow players to explore Eastern Asia with three new regions: China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Despite Crusader Kings 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crusader-kings-iii-is-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-on-march-29/1100-6499972/">console versions releasing back in 2022</a>, the expansion pass is only available for PC. It's currently unknown when this expansion pass will go to other platforms.</p>
