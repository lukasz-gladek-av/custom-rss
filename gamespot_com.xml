                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 11 is poised to bring huge changes to Blizzard's ARPG, and will overhaul item progression, see the return of leaderboards, rework the Renown system, and even dramatically change how the game's potions work. And that's not even everything.</p><p dir="ltr">While noticeable changes to the core of Diablo 4 come alongside nearly every season, most notably with Season 4's Loot Reborn, Season 11 still stands out. None of these changes were detailed in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">2025 content roadmap</a>, and Blizzard has teased for months that many of players' biggest gripes with the game would be addressed in a coming update. Now we finally know what Blizzard has been cooking.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075" data-ratio="0.56267217630854" data-width="1452" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075"></a><figcaption>Masterworking and Tempering are becoming less random in Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Tempering And Masterworking Overhaul</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest complaint players have had since Season 4 regards the act of Tempering and Masterworking items. In the current live version of Diablo 4, Tempering allows players to add affixes to items but with a catch.</p><p dir="ltr">The act of Tempering has an element of randomness, as each Tempering recipe usually contains up to three possible affixes. Which affix gets applied is random, and players often end up "bricking" an item by being unable to get their desired affix. Masterworking, too, has an element of luck, with bonus affix upgrades every few levels applied at random. Players trying to optimize their gear to the fullest often have to reset the item when the bonus affix upgrade doesn't land on a desired roll and start the entire Masterworking process over again from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all changing with Season 11. As detailed in a new blog outlined what all is coming to Diablo 4's public test realm, Tempering will finally no longer be random, with players able to apply the affix of their choice to gear. That affix can also be changed as many times as a player likes (as long as they have the necessary resources). The catch is that gear can now only have one Tempered affix. To compensate, non-Unique items are having their base number of affixes raised from three to four.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the Tempering changes is an update to Masterworking. Instead of improving the value of affixes, Masterworking instead improves an item's overall quality, up to a quality level of 20. Higher-quality items have increased base damage, armor, or resistances, and Masterworking an item has a chance to increase its quality by two to five levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Once an item hits Masterwork level 20, players can roll for a Capstone bonus, which upgrades a random non-greater affix on the item and turns it into a greater one. These Capstone bonuses can be re-rolled an unlimited amount of times without resetting an item's quality, allowing players to hone in on specific affixes necessary for their build (though it will cost some upgrade currencies).</p><p dir="ltr">More than just changing how Tempering and Masterworking works, Blizzard has additionally added a final step for an item's upgrade journey--Sanctification. This new system lets players use a fraction of Heaven's power to sanctify an item. Sanctifying an item has a random chance to apply one of the following benefits:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bonus Legendary power</li><li dir="ltr">Turn an affix into a Greater Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Add a bonus Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Replace an existing affix with a Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Make an item indestructible</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sanctifying an item makes the item unmodifiable. Blizzard warns that Sanctification should always be the very last upgrade made to an item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4 Season 11 is introducing a final step in an item's upgrade path called Sanctification.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Healing And Defense Changes</h2><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11's major rework for item progression isn't the only big change. It's also completely changing how defenses work, and scrapping the game's entire existing potion system in the process. Armor and Resistances are becoming a rating system, and one with diminishing returns at higher levels. Armor will reduce all damage taken, rather than just physical, and the armor and resistance penalties associated with each Torment difficulty will be removed. A new character-stat page that aggregates all of a character's defensive stats into one number, Toughness, will help give players a better idea of how durable they overall are.</p><p dir="ltr">As for healing, Blizzard is ripping out the existing potion system. Instead of needing to upgrade potions every few levels, potions in Diablo 4 Season 11 will instead always immediately heal 35% of a player's total health. Base potion capacity is being reduced to four as a result, but potions will recharge over 30 seconds. To aid with healing, values for all life-gaining affixes like life on kill, life on hit, and life regeneration have all had their values increased.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortify, a unique Diablo 4 mechanic that grants additional defenses when overhealing, is being changed into what is essentially an extra life bar that's slowly drained to heal over time. When Fortified, players will heal a percentage of their max life every second, draining the Fortified health pool.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Renown Reborn</h2><p dir="ltr">Potions aren't the only idea from the launch version of Diablo 4 that is being scrapped. Renown, a zone-specific reputation system that has various rewards like additional potion slots, skill points, and gold tied to it, is going away, at least for the game's Seasonal realm. It will still exist permanently in the Eternal realm, effectively making for noticeably different versions of Diablo 4 to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">On the game's seasonal server, Renown is being replaced and combined with the game's current Season Journey system to form a new system called Season Rank. Players will earn rewards like additional skill and paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, and cosmetics by completing various objectives and advancing their Season Rank. Altars of Lilith will grant experience and minor rewards, but will no longer grant permanent stats as they have since the game launched.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086"></a><figcaption>Leaderboards are finally returning in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Tower</h2><p dir="ltr">Leaderboards are returning to Diablo 4 after having previously been deactivated alongside the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion. This time, however, they are taking a new form--The Tower. A new multi-floor dungeon, The Tower works similarly to The Pit, where players will need to battle through monsters and fill a meter within a 10-minute time limit.</p><p dir="ltr">Once enough monsters (or progress orbs that drop from them) have been slain, a random Tower boss will spawn. Defeating them concludes the dungeon and stops the timer, registering the run on the new leaderboard. There will be solo leaderboards for each class, as well as leaderboards for parties of two, three, and four. There will additionally be separate leaderboards for Hardcore characters. Blizzard said the version of The Tower and leaderboard appearing in Season 11 will be considered a beta, and that it hopes to update The Tower in future seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">There's more too, with Season 11 set to add a new world boss for the first time since launch, make enemy monsters tougher, and introduce a whole new set of seasonal powers and mechanics. Testing for Diablo 4 Season 11 will begin on the game's PTR October 21, with the season proper set to debut on December 9. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion</a> is slated to arrive sometime next year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> may be far more challenging come Season 11, with a slew of updates set to address monster behavior and difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by Blizzard, the goal is to have monsters starting with Season 11 more regularly test players' defenses and force players to interact with them in new ways. Enemy monsters will see changes to make their behavior less predictable, while at the same time making it so each type of monster will have their own clear role and identity in combat. Monsters packs will also group up less, making it more difficult for players to wipe out large groups of multiple packs in a single go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093"></a><figcaption>Azmodan will be a new world boss coming in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A big part of the update to monsters will be new affixes, with more than 20 additional affixes for players to deal with. Elites will spawn minions that inherit some of their affixes, and affixes will in general be more powerful, requiring players to deal with them before taking out less-dangerous foes. Blizzard said that overall, monster affixes should overlap less in their design, be more visually clear, and be more engaging.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes, in conjunction with other Season 11 updates like fewer potion charges and item progression changes, should make Diablo 4 overall more challenging than before. But deadlier monsters aren't the only thing players have to be afraid of. Season 11 is also adding a new world boss, as well as ways to encounter endgame Lesser Evil bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and Belial while doing endgame activities like Helltide, The Pit, and Kurast Undercity. The new world boss, the first added since Diablo 4's launch over two years ago, will be a familiar face to Diablo 3 players. Azmodan, the Lord of Sin, has a chance to appear as a world boss in the game's open world but can also be summoned at will using a special altar south of Zarbinzet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if the ability to summon the Lesser Evils is an evergreen mechanic or strictly seasonal one, but defeating bosses in this way will reward Divine Favor, used to level up a seasonal Divine Gifts mechanic and increase players' Season Rank (a new system for the game's seasonal server that combines the game's current Renown and Season Journey systems).</p><p dir="ltr">More powerful monsters and the inclusion of Azmodan aren't the only big changes coming next season, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11 poised to be the game's biggest rework yet</a>. Season 11 will additionally overhaul item progression with sweeping changes to Masterworking and Tempering, reintroduce leaderboards, and more. Diablo 4 Season 11 is slated to begin on December 9, with PTR testing for the season beginning October 21. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion</a> is expected to release in 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>"Our research suggests that GTA 6 will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much discussed $100," MIDiA Research's Head of Data and study co-author, Perry Gresham, told IGN. "A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table.”</p><p>The firm's games analyst, Brandon Sutton, echoed Gresham's sentiment, saying that GTA 6's price--whatever it ends up being--should "serve as a caution" to other publishers looking to raise game prices.</p><p>"Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game," Sutton said. "This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing."</p><p>IGN pointed to some other findings within the study, too. MIDiA Research found that 60% of consumers said they'd "definitely" or "probably" buy GTA 6 at $70, while just 35% said the same thing if the game were $100. Of course, that number jumped to 79% if Rockstar dropped its crime sim at an improbable $50, and a whopping 16% would scoop the game up at an eye-watering $150 tag.</p><p>This suggests that, according to MIDiA Research, the "optimal" $70 price would equate to nearly 9% of US adults buying the game, which could total to about 22.9 million copies sold and roughly $1.6 billion in revenue.</p><p>That means that, unlike former Saints Row developer Chris Stockman, who said in an October 2025 Esports Insider interview that he "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">really hope[s]</a>"GTA 6 launches at $100, most others in MIDiA Research's study completely disagree with this feeling.</p><p>However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">dodged questions around raising game prices</a>, so we just have no clue how much GTA 6 will cost when it launches on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Game developer Hideo Kojima is famous for his unconventional approach to, well, everything he does--but even one of his sillier marketing moves for PS5 title Death Stranding 2: On the Beach didn't immediately hit as intended.</p><p>Speaking to Japanese magazine <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/62013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">An-An</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/no-one-was-accepting-hideo-kojimas-free-death-stranding-2-tissues-on-the-streets-of-tokyo-until-he-tweeted-about-it-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automation</a>), Kojima recalled an on-the-ground marketing stunt that he and other Kojima Productions team members carried out in the streets of Tokyo, passing out Death Stranding 2-branded tissue packs that included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/" data-ref-id="1100-6531775">QR code for a rather cryptic trailer</a> of the game.</p><p>It's a campaign that might sound unusual to some, but passing out tissue packs was once a common advertising tactic in Japan, akin to advertising businesses on matchboxes. The idea here is that passersby are being handed something with functionality instead of simple flyers, which are promptly discarded afterward.</p><p>Kojima himself admitted that the practice was outdated, but the act of physically handing objects to people was in line with the themes of his game. Unfortunately for Kojima and his compatriots, no one was biting.</p><p>"Hardly anyone was willing to take one. Even when I reached out, they wouldn’t take it. They’d walk away without even making eye contact. Some even went out of their way to avoid us, as if they were walking around something dangerous," Kojima said.</p><p>It's fair to attribute that aversion to human interaction to the shifting cultural norms after the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the prevalence of digital advertising. Perhaps pedestrians simply had no interest in a video game, let alone a rather esoteric one like Death Stranding.</p><p>But we can't rule out the possibility that any of these folks fully knew who Kojima is and simply chose not to engage. Back in 2013, Kojima publicly chastised critics of his character Quiet from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, who wore little more than a bikini and some tactical gear. The developer famously declared that when those who raised ire over her design realized the story reason for her attire, they would be "ashamed of [their] words &amp; deeds."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/376424398023962624?lang=en" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">(Cont) But once you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, you will feel ashamed of your words &amp; deeds.</p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/376424398023962624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2013</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless of whether this initial failure was due to changing social habits post-COVID, a lack of interest in a video game, or genuine shame from one's words and deeds, Kojima turned the tide by simply <a href="https://x.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1925836446360854998" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on X</a> about the stunt, leading to Kojima Productions fully exhausting its supply of tissues.</p><p>"It was an analog stunt going against the tide of the times, but by fusing it with digital power, we created an even stronger connection," Kojima said, tying this story to the themes of Death Stranding 2 in a roundabout manner.</p><p>Looking ahead, Kojima has a lot on his plate, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">Xbox horror game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">PlayStation stealth title Physint</a> in development. The Metal Gear creator is also one of a few developers expressing openness to the use of AI in game development, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">calling AI "more of a friend."</a></p>
