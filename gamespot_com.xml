          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Gameplay (Pre-Alpha Build) | gamescom 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to be an anthology of various Lego-ized Batman movies similar to Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but even that isn't quite right. It would be more accurate to call it a <em>fusion</em> of Batman movies, alongside other influences and stories, to build something new and original from all of its various parts. In that way, it's perfectly Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, the story mission I played at Gamescom took place in Axis Chemicals, which fans of the 1989 Michael Keaton movie will immediately recognize as the birthplace of the Joker. But instead of gangster sociopath Jack Napier being dispatched to destroy incriminating evidence in the chemical plant (but with the situation becoming a setup to kill him for sleeping with the boss' moll), it's Red Hood #1, leader of the Red Hood Gang, as we've seen serve as the Joker origin story in some comic iterations. Red Hood is using the factory to manufacture a strange new compound that makes its victims laugh uncontrollably until they die. Under the hood is an unmistakable (and very passable) Jack Nicholson impression, so the character is not <em>not</em> the Batman '89 Joker, but he's been blended with other stories.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the Batman who confronts him, at least in this demo, was the Robert Pattinson iteration of the character, accompanied by a Jim Gordon who looks very much like a Lego Jeffrey Wright, each of them from the 2022 film The Batman.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mixing and matching of various great moments from Batman cinematic history is core to the spirit of Legacy of the Dark Knight, which sets the ambitious target of weaving elements of all of the Batman movies with other media into a single coherent story. When asked what that means for recurring characters played by different actors like the Joker, TT Games' Jonathan Smith told GameSpot that perhaps some terrible things will happen to the Joker that will make him even more sinister and--presumably, but left unsaid--more like Heath Ledger's incarnation in The Dark Knight.</p><p dir="ltr">That same sense of playfulness extends to the Easter eggs, which have always been a Lego staple but feel more focused here. Rather than collecting a hundred doodads to unlock 200 different but mechanically identical characters, you're unlocking deep-cut styles for Batman and Commissioner Gordon. Those include some you'd expect, like iconic movie appearances, alongside some you might not. Batman looked especially great in his Brave and the Bold costume modeled after the 2008 cartoon show.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Batman and Gordon have looks based on their very first comic appearances, including Bats' dopey big cowl ears and Gordon's white suit and wispy mustache. The most surprising was <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Detective_Comics_Vol_1_241" rel="nofollow ">Batman's Rainbow Suit</a>, a fully rendered Lego version of a classic and extremely goofy Silver Age comic book that has received iconic camp status.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But not content to borrow solely from great Batman movies, Legacy of the Dark Knight also borrows from great Batman games. The combat is clearly inspired by the Arkham series, as Batman can perform stealth takedowns of unsuspecting Lego enemies or jump into the middle of a brawl with timing-based combat. This is simplified in some ways--the timing windows are wider and the visual indicators are bigger than in the Arkham games, and you only have two gadgets to use in fights. But it feels like an affectionate homage to mechanics that have become as central to the character as any movie, in the minds of Arkham fans. Legacy of the Dark Knight also introduces difficulty levels, letting younger or less-experienced players THWACK and POW like Batman, while giving more experienced Arkham fans more and tougher enemies to fight and, for the first time I remember, a limited pool of lives to spend on encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the later Arkham games, the hub world is a wide-open Gotham City that can be explored freely. You can stop crimes, find Bat caches, smash collectibles like Penguin rubber duckies, and skulk along the rooftops or gracefully glide between them. You can zip-line your way up to gain speed and then float, and if you've built up enough energy from beating down thugs, you can launch even higher into the air to get a birds-eye view of the city. If going ground-level is more your style, you can summon a Batmobile anywhere in the open world. I only saw the Robert Pattinson muscle car iteration from The Batman in my demo, but TT Games has already teased many more Batmobiles to come, and they can be freely equipped like Batman and Gordon's costumes.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't really know what to expect next out of TT Games after The Skywalker Saga, but Legacy of the Dark Knight is such a pleasant surprise. When you're finished building a Lego set, you might take it apart and see what else you can make from all the pieces. TT Games looks to be doing that with the Batman mythos, and I can't wait to see what they build out of it.</p>

                <p>Xbox's Design Head <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361111873749991426/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> about the current generation of Xbox wrapping up. That could mean a lot of things, so we can't read much into it. Given the timing though, it makes sense that Microsoft is thinking about what's next. Here's what was said, and what's happening with Microsoft's gaming division these days, to help us make sense of the situation.</p><p>"As we wrap up this journey with the Xbox Series X and Series S, the mission behind these consoles echoes everything I’ve learned over 30 years--to create technology that’s powerful, purposeful, and beautifully integrated into people’s lives,” wrote Carl Ledbetter, Partner Head of Design at Xbox.</p><p>"Xbox is about fun and playing games," he continued. "The console, the controller, the headset, all of the devices become a reflection of the people who make them, but more importantly, of the people who choose to purchase and use them. These products matter to people."</p><p>This isn't exactly big news if you've been paying attention to the clues Microsoft has been sprinkling around, but it's the first time someone from Xbox has specifically spoken about sunsetting the consoles. Microsoft has spent the better part of the last year insistently telling us that "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This is an Xbox</a>," while holding up various household appliances and electronics to show us how broad--or meaningless--the definition of the word Xbox is.</p><p>Microsoft also talked in June about how it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">partnering with AMD</a> to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including future first-party consoles and cloud."</p><p>For a good 25 years or so, there was a pretty steady cadence of consoles releases every five-or-so years. When a new one came along, it felt like a big deal, especially during the days when a new released doubled gaming's available bits, or unlocked a then-unexplored third dimension. But console generations have been getting longer and longer since the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That generation and the next both lasted about seven years each.</p><p>And indeed, it feels like console makers have barely tapped the power of their consoles. Games take longer to make, and are increasingly made using similar development tools, so innovations don't come as quickly as they used to. But Microsoft has also been at a significant disadvantage this generation, the same way it was with the Xbox One; information pieced together from Sony's advertised sales numbers and analyst estimates of sold systems suggest Sony has moved twice as many PlayStation 5s as Microsoft has sold Xbox Series X and S consoles.</p><p>With Microsoft lagging in sales and broadening the definition of what it wants players to consider an Xbox portal, it seems like the company is downplaying the importance of a core first-party console moving forward. Even its announced partnership with AMD, which mentions first-party consoles, also mentions a "portfolio of devices." Former PlayStation exec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-at-a-sega-like-fork-in-the-road-and-may-stop-making-consoles-ex-playstation-boss-says/1100-6533966/" data-ref-id="1100-6533966">Shawn Layden</a> said just last week that Microsoft "is in that same sort of fork in the road" that Sega reached toward the end of the short life of the Sega Dreamcast.</p><p>With all that said, "wrap up" is a pretty difficult phrase to define here. Microsoft has made an effort to make its software cross-generational since the Xbox One. Announced games will still be compatible with the Xbox Series consoles, and future, unannounced ones likely will, too.</p><p>Wrapping up a console generation is also a thing that takes years. From the perspective of a Head of Design like Ledbetter, there's probably not much to do with the Xbox Series consoles at this point. After all, they're already designed. New chips and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">consoles</a>, on the other hand, take years to design, and Ledbetter, who wrote his "journey is far from over," probably has a lot more to do with that unannounced hardware right now.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> won't be leaving early access and launching in full this year, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2s-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">Path of Exile 2's huge The Third Edict update</a>, which adds the ARPG's fourth campaign act, new temporary interlude acts, its first seasonal league, and more, Rogers said that despite his hopes earlier in the year, Path of Exile 2 won't fully release in 2025. That also means the game won't be going free-to-play anytime soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiA_IFmidOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KiA_IFmidOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I definitely don't believe that's possible anymore," Rogers said. "Things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped. Ultimately, there's two things that need to happen before we can leave early access. One of them is that we obviously need to finish the campaign. I don't think that will take too much longer. But the other one is we have to get to the point of balance where everyone is actually happy with how things are. The general opinion needs to be that we've actually got it locked in. Obviously we can't go into full release until we've sorted that out. Once those two things are true, then we'll release."</p><p dir="ltr">While The Third Edict update adds Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, developer Grinding Gear Games still needs to release Acts V and VI. Rogers said that while Act V will definitely come as part of early access, it's possible Act VI's arrival would coincide with the game's full launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There are still five classes yet to be added to Path of Exile 2 as well--the Templar, Druid, Shadow, Marauder, and Duelist. One nearly made it into The Third Edict, Rogers said, but ultimately didn't make the cut.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still intended to get a class out for this one, we just didn't quite finish it in time," Rogers said. "There will definitely be a class in the next update, I'd say. I say definitely even though I probably shouldn't, but the classes unfortunately have a bit of unbounded amount of time. You can go into them thinking you know what they are and then by the time you're actually done, you've refactored a bunch of things a bunch of times and it's way harder than you expect. We had a class in mind, we did a lot of work on it. We realized, 'You know what, if we're going to finish off all these bosses and things, we can't quite finish the class,' so it ended up not happening, but we'll get there."</p><p dir="ltr">GGG has previously said it expected Path of Exile 2 to be in early access for "at least" six months. Towards the beginning of this year, GGG announced it was putting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-throwing-a-wrench-into-updates-for-poe-1-we-were-fooling-ourselves/1100-6529154/" data-ref-id="1100-6529154">major update on hold for the original Path of Exile</a> in order to work on updates for Path of Exile 2. At the time, Rogers said the studio "still had a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to dive into Path of Exile 2 but don't want to pay for early access, the game will be holding a free weekend August 29-September 1 to coincide with the launch of The Third Edict update.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>

<p>In Halloween: The Game, players will take on the roles of either residents of Haddonfield, Illinois or The Shape himself, Michael Myers. As residents, players will need to survive, stick to the shadows, warn other residents, and hopefully reach the authorities before Michael gashes them up.</p><p>The game will offer a single-player story mode, offline bots mode, and online asymmetrical PvP. It will also include multiple maps and "authentic locations" pulled from the classic film. Last October, GameSpot spoke to several creators working in the space of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/" data-ref-id="1100-6527506">adapting horror movies into games</a>. Gun Media CEO, Wes Keltner, told me at that time that he wanted "to work with [Illfonic] again, 100%. So I'm hoping that we can find something that is a good fit for both our teams at the right time."</p><p>At that time, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-halloween-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-is-in-development-gamer-john-carpenter-is-involved/1100-6525712/" data-ref-id="1100-6525712">Halloween project built in Unreal Engine 5 had already been teased by Boss Team Games</a>, a publisher that also operates in the horror movie-to-game pipeline, having previously worked on things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retrorealms-double/" data-ref-id="5000-639530">RetroRealms</a>. It's unclear at this time whether this is that same Halloween game. It seems to be, in which case it would seem Boss Team is no longer involved, and instead, the Friday The 13th duo has achieved their reunion.</p><p>In the time since Friday The 13th, Illfonic has gone on to make other licensed multiplayer games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Meanwhile, Gun put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned to GameSpot for much more on this upcoming horror project. </p>
