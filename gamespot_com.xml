                <p>Near the end of 2024, CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into full development with a release date potentially years away. Now, some outlets are putting forth theories that there may be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/" data-ref-id="5000-167462">Witcher 3</a> expansion to fill the gap between the present and the fourth game's release.</p><p><a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?_gl=1*15mojc3*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTI2MzU0NjY5LjE3Njc4OTI3MzQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3Njc4OTI3MzQkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njc4OTI3MzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> separately released stories suggesting that The Witcher 3 will get its first expansion since Blood and Wine was released in 2016. Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees.</p><p>That program has been <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned by the company itself</a>, which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, "There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p><p>The report from IGN Poland offers some speculative details about what The Witcher 3 expansion may contain, including Zerrikania, "an exotic desert region to the far east of The Witcher 3's current map." Blood and Wine did refer to the Zerrikanian Manticore School, which could be followed-up on if the report is accurate.</p><p>For now, neither report is confirmed. CD Projekt Red has only announced that The Witcher 3 will get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-adding-a-big-new-feature-10-years-after-launch/1100-6531938/" data-ref-id="1100-6531938">one final update</a> that will allow console players to enjoy many of the mods that PC players have used for years. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">that update was pushed back to this year</a> late in 2025. Outside of the games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-season-5-coming-this-year-will-end-the-series/1100-6537256/" data-ref-id="1100-6537256">The Witcher Season 5</a> will wrap up its run on Netflix in 2026.</p>
