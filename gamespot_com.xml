When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I’m at a loss for words.
