Eve can complement her holiday look by also equipping the Santa Girl hairstyle and the Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs. Eve's drone also receives the Rudolph Pack that attaches a new look to it, complete with a red nose and horns.</p><p>A new minigame has been added as well. It looks like players just have to shoot at a target wrapped in a wreath to win prizes, although it wasn't stated what those prizes were. At camps, players can choose the seasonal "Dawn (Winter)" and "Take Me Away" background music tracks. Last but not least, the update adds a Christmas tree in The Last Gulp, the bar where Xion's citizens gather.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230"></a><figcaption>Adam's "I'm No Santa" costume</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png"></figure><p>In the settings, players can also toggle seasonal and DLC content on/off whenever they want, which includes the holiday and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/" data-ref-id="1100-6526688">Nier: Automata content</a>.</p><p>Stellar Blade is currently available for PS5, and on sale for $50 as part of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stellar-Blade-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CTVK7GBM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's holiday sale.</a> Shift Up is aiming to release it on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-expects-the-game-to-be-even-bigger-on-pc-aiming-for-2025-launch/1100-6527731/" data-ref-id="1100-6527731">PC next year</a>.

                <p>From Software launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> in February 2022, and the game quickly caught on among players. It was a massive hit from the start--so much so that the sales of Elden Ring have almost caught up with From's previous franchise, Dark Souls, in just under three years.</p><p>Bandai Namco has announced that as of September 2024, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million copies worldwide. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC expansion surely helped raise those numbers in 2024. Before Elden Ring's 2022 release, the Dark Souls games sold 27 million copies combined. This led some observers to suggest that Elden Ring had already surpassed Dark Souls' all-time numbers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. <br>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, that was a premature assessment. The Dark Souls games now have <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/en/ir/library/assets/pdf/2024/factbook2024_en_1-6.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 37 million copies to their name</a>, which means that Elden Ring still has a ways to go before it catches up. But given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-just-20-for-black-friday/1100-6527932/" data-ref-id="1100-6527932">Elden Ring was heavily discounted for Black Friday</a>, it may have closed some of the distance between the two franchises. Bandai Namco hasn't shared those updated numbers yet.</p><p>Surprisingly, From Software <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-2-is-not-happening-at-least-not-yet/1100-6528191/" data-ref-id="1100-6528191">doesn't seem to be in a hurry to make Elden Ring 2</a>. In the meantime, the recently announced co-op game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-for-2025-co-op-action-spin-off/1100-6528435/" data-ref-id="1100-6528435">Elden Right Nightreign</a>, is expected to debut in 2025. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wont-have-cross-play/1100-6528467/" data-ref-id="1100-6528467">Nightreign won't have cross-play</a>, players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">will be able to sign up for a test</a> starting early next year.</p>
