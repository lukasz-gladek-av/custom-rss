                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s summer season finally drawing to a close, we've got some big stuff to look forward to in Chapter 6 Season 4, especially with Fortnitemares just around the corner. Epic Games hasn't yet begun teasing the new season, so we don't officially know much of anything yet. But as is usually the case, enough details have leaked that we're able to get at least a little bit of a sense about what's coming.</p><p dir="ltr">With that being the case, let's stop messing around and get right to the details.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_start_">When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 start?</a></li><li><a href="#Is_there_a_live_event_to_end_Chapter_6_Season_3_">Is there a live event to end Chapter 6 Season 3?</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Season_4_the_final_Season_of_Fortnite_Chapter_6_">Is Season 4 the final Season of Fortnite Chapter 6?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_battle_pass">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_gameplay_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 gameplay changes</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnitemares_2025">Fortnitemares 2025</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_map_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 map changes</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_start_">When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 start?</h2><p dir="ltr">The current season is set to end on August 7, which is a Thursday. Chapter 6 Season 4 should therefore kick off the next morning, on August 8.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_there_a_live_event_to_end_Chapter_6_Season_3_">Is there a live event to end Chapter 6 Season 3?</h2><p dir="ltr">With the season coming to a close on a Thursday night, there <em>probably</em> won't be a major live event in Battle Royale to close the season. But a smaller ambient live event, like the giant sword battle between Daigo and Kendo that happened during BR matches at the end of Chapter 6 Season 1, is still possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, however, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">event ending the current Fortnite OG season</a>, if you're into that nostalgic mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538420" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538420"></a><figcaption>Chapter 6 Season 3 is just about over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Season_4_the_final_Season_of_Fortnite_Chapter_6_">Is Season 4 the final Season of Fortnite Chapter 6?</h2><p dir="ltr">Since new Fortnite chapters have always launched in December, for Season 4 to be the last season of the chapter, it would have to run for nearly four months. Considering Season 3 is going to be Fortnite's shortest season ever at just over two months, it would be pretty surprising if Season 4 were twice as long.</p><p dir="ltr">No, with Season 4 starting so relatively early, we should expect a new mini-season, like last year's Chapter 2 Remix, and this spring's Star Wars Galactic Battle. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1931472840118993316" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It's been rumored for months</a> that The Simpsons will be the subject of the next mini-season, so that's what everyone is currently expecting in November.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's also been rumored for months that Season 4 will have <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1931514174334443794" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an alien invasion theme</a>, apparently involving bug people rather than Fortnite's traditional-style aliens like Human Bill or Kymera. It wouldn't be the first time an alien invasion has hit the Battle Royale island. During Chapter 2 Season 7, aliens led by the nefarious Last Reality tried to take over the island and would abduct players during matches and force them to play mini-games for loot.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if this rumored new invasion would have anything to do with the previous one, or if it might <em>Herald</em> (<a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8338" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cough cough</a>) the return of some old favorite characters like Dr. Slone, the Cube Queen, or the IO.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite island previously suffered an alien invasion back in Chapter 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_battle_pass">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been any specific leaks about what will be on the Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass yet, but there were a number of bug-themed skins on a recent survey that Epic sent to some Fortnite players. <a href="https://youtu.be/p46Bubo-rx4?si=qA4CZ1IM2s3p7a5A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This video</a> from content creator Nerpah highlights some of them--just keep in mind that the video contains no leaks or confirmed info about battle pass skins, and is purely speculative based on leaks about the theme.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_gameplay_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 gameplay changes</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been many detailed leaks aside from the season theme itself, but a couple of notable things have come through, like a new "<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bug gauntlets</a>" item, and the return of mud. We don't know what the bug gauntlets are, but it would likely be a weapon or utility item like this season's Bass Boost (movement and a knockback attack) and Myst Gauntlets (fires a flock of birds).</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mud</a>, we last saw that mechanic back in Chapter 4 when Epic added a jungle biome to the center of the island. Players could use the mud puddles for quick movement, and in the process would cover themselves in mud that would make them invisible to thermal scopes. So if mud returns, it may bring some other things with it, like more items with thermal sights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnitemares_2025">Fortnitemares 2025</h2><p dir="ltr">Ever since Fortnite moved to yearly chapters starting with Chapter 3, each year's Season 4 has been the home of the annual spooky Fortnitemares event that goes down each October. Fortnitemares usually involves a collab with a horror-themed IP--2024's collabs were Saw, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and the Disney Villains, and the year before that brought Halloween, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Alan Wake. None of this year's Fortnitemares collabs have leaked yet, but there will almost certainly be multiple new item shop skins on par with the collabs mentioned above.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_map_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 map changes</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know yet about new additions to the map for Season 4, but it's probably safe to assume that most, if not all, of the Star Wars locations will remain, along with Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Spots added in the middle of a chapter are not usually removed until we move on to a new island entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the places we'd expect to be swapped out for new stuff are locations that have been there since the chapter began. Which would be Shogun's Solitude, Canyon Crossing, Shining Span, Flooded Frogs, and Pumped Power. It's also possible major new locations will be added in spots where there is currently nothing, as Epic recently did when it added the Fortress of Solitude.</p>

                <p>Fans of Happy Gilmore will want to keep their remotes handy after watching the sequel, Happy Gilmore 2, on Netflix. The streaming platform has just released a new tie-in video game: Happy Gilmore: Golf Mayhem ’98 Demo, available to all subscribers for free.</p><p>The retro-style game, <a href="https://amberstudio.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developed by Amber</a>, can be played on TVs and desktop devices. According to Netflix, the game offers a nostalgic '90s arcade experience, blending chaotic golf gameplay with combat-style mechanics reminiscent of Mortal Kombat. Players can golf, battle familiar characters, and wreak havoc across a cartoonish golf course--all in a short, punchy game packed with Easter eggs for longtime fans.</p><p>While the game takes place during the first Happy Gilmore movie, it's actually a nod to the opening scene in the sequel, where Gilmore has become a video game star a la Tony Hawk.</p><p>Netflix has also partnered with Spotify for a separate interactive experience, the Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament. Available within the Spotify app, the tournament features film-inspired golf challenges, classic audio clips, hidden references, and even a custom playlist to blast while you play.</p><p>Over the past three years, the company has expanded its library to over 100 titles, moving beyond mobile to include more web and TV-compatible games. While it continues to develop games tied to popular Netflix IPs such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squid-game-unleashed-lets-you-play-in-a-cartoonish-version-of-the-shows-capitalist-hellscape/1100-6525995/" data-ref-id="1100-6525995">Squid Game: Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-adds-another-game-to-its-library-based-on-a-black-mirror-episode/1100-6530778/" data-ref-id="1100-6530778">Black Mirror: Thronglets</a>, and Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game, the streamer is now focusing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-will-remove-all-of-these-games-in-july-2025/2900-6698/" data-ref-id="2900-6698">less on acquiring indie games</a> and more on developing more games tied to their original programming.</p>
