                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-463558">Star Wars Battlefront 2</a> continues to reach new heights on Steam, as the game has once again broken its concurrent-player record.</p><p dir="ltr">On June 23, Battlefront 2 saw 35,892 concurrent players according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, marking a new peak. That number is no doubt in part thanks to the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237950/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront 2 is currently on sale</a> for $4 and is one of Steam's top-selling games. The game is also available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though Battlefront 2 doesn't support cross-play between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefront 2 has been steadily working its way up Steam's most-played games list since early May, when the game first began to climb from its usual player counts of around 1,000-1,500 in April to 5,000 concurrent players and beyond. In late May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">Battlefront 2 broke its previous concurrent-player record</a> on Valve's platform and later peaked at nearly 19,000. Those player counts then dipped back down below 10,000 in subsequent weeks, only to skyrocket once more in the past few days to even higher heights.</p><p dir="ltr">Where, exactly, the huge surge of interest in Battlefront 2 came from eight years after the game's launch is up for debate, but it looks to have begun around the time Andor season 2 concluded on Disney+. The show in large part focuses on the formation of the Rebel Alliance and its struggle against the Empire in the leadup to Rogue One and A New Hope. The show also prominently features the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as a key location--an iconic Star Wars setting that just so happens to be a playable map in Battlefront 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Renewed interest in the Star Wars shooter has translated into calls from Andor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actor Muhannad Ben Amor</a> and players for EA to make a Star Wars Battlefront 3. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-anytime-soon-or-ever-despite-recent-surge-in-players/1100-6531786/" data-ref-id="1100-6531786">players shouldn't expect Battlefront 3 anytime soon</a>, as a former DICE producer who worked on Battlefront 2 said it would be "challenging" to bring back the original development team, as they are now "spread far and wide."</p><p dir="ltr">It's been reported previously that despite DICE's two modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">Battlefront games selling more than 33 million copies combined</a>, EA allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch for Battlefront 3 due to licensing costs</a>. DICE, as well as a number of other EA studios, are currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's not Battlefront 3, EA is still publishing a new Star Wars game. Announced at Star Wars Celebration Japan, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6530993/" data-ref-id="1100-6530993">Star Wars: Zero Company</a> is a turn-based tactics game set during the Clone Wars, coming from developers who previously worked on the critically acclaimed XCOM series. Star Wars: Zero Company is set to be released in 2026.</p>

                <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 23, 2015. Below, we look at how it raised the bar for not only superhero games, but for the third act in video game trilogies.</i></p><p dir="ltr">There's an old adage that good things come in threes, and that's an idea that applies perfectly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. Rocksteady's final chapter in its Caped Crusader saga turned 10 years old this week, and it's still a masterpiece of superhero action that has stood the test of time. There's a lot to love about the game, from its dark storyline to its shocking twists--the Arkham Knight was a <em>red hood herring</em>--and more, but the lasting legacy of the game is that it solved the problem of video game trilogies a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s a familiar scenario: You fire up the third game in a beloved series, ready to be wowed. It’s good. You're having fun. But you can’t shake the feeling that you’ve done it all before. "More of the same" is a common criticism against video game trilogies' final chapters--but it's one Arkham Knight skillfully sidestepped.</p><p dir="ltr">If Arkham Asylum laid the foundation, then Arkham City was the stately Wayne Manor built atop it--bigger, bolder, and more refined. But by the time Arkham Knight came around, there were fears of fatigue. It followed the release of Batman: Arkham Origins in 2013 by Warner Bros. Montreal, which wasn't part of Rocksteady's trilogy but received considerably less acclaim. Could Rocksteady keep the momentum going?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It did--by pushing every idea of its Batman to the extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Arkham Knight is a finely tuned power fantasy built on three pillars: detective work, stealth, and bone-crunching combat. One moment you’re reconstructing crime scenes with high-tech forensic tools; the next, you’re a silent predator stalking armed militia; and then you're diving into balletic brawls that stitch gadgets and combos into a brutal symphony of chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">At this stage, Rocksteady trusted players to know how to be Batman. And in return, it gave them the tools to break past the limits of earlier games. Combat flowed with graceful brutality as you weaved through enemies using freeze grenades, shock rounds, and precision counters. In stealth segments, the fear mechanic hit new highs, as nothing quite matched the rush of trapping a squad of militants with a smoke bomb cloud and then quickly eliminating them one by one using new gameplay mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">But the game didn't just empower players--it challenged them. With the Arkham Knight and his private army escalating the threat level, players had to evolve. Rocksteady walked the razor’s edge between power fantasy and overpower fantasy, and never lost its balance along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then there was the Batmobile. What if Batman were a car? That’s the question Rocksteady answered by transforming Gotham’s most iconic vehicle into a game-changing mechanic. Not just a way to move across the city, the Batmobile became an extension of the Dark Knight himself--solving puzzles, charging into battles, and even taking on tanks. There's something surreal and satisfying about sneaking up on Deathstroke’s armored convoy in a 1,200bhp crime-fighting machine that could somehow still meet strict European noise-pollution requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Batman: Arkham Knight <em>is </em>more of the same, but pushed to its absolute extreme. It's a fitting finale to the Arkhamverse--especially if you choose to ignore Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League--and a celebration of Batman that still shines a decade later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to grab the game and celebrate its anniversary, then now is a great time to do so. The Arkham Knight Premium Edition regularly sells for an absurdly low price--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=10+Years+Ago%2C+Batman%3A+Arkham+Knight+Solved+The+Video+Game+Trilogy+Problem&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A18&amp;fnarticle_id=6532637&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Standard+Feature&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbatman_arkham_knight_premium_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F10-years-ago-batman-arkham-knight-solved-the-video-game-trilogy-problem%2F1100-6532637%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">GOG has a DRM-free version for just $6</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/">2025 Summer Sale</a>--and it's incredibly good value for money. Not only do you get the base game, but there’s a Batcave of DLC to dig into that ranges from challenge maps to standalone episodes focusing on Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've picked up a Switch 2, the game has also been substantially improved on the Nintendo platform as part of the Arkham Trilogy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE41LJyXh0"> According to Digital Foundry</a>, it's not entirely perfect, but it does run at a locked and mostly stable 30fps when compared to the sluggish performance on the original Switch.</p>

                <p>The veil shrouding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming Midnight expansion is set to be lifted at Gamescom 2025, with Blizzard confirming news and updates at the show about the next chapter in the game's Worldsoul Saga trilogy.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced fans can expect "exclusive news and updates" about Midnight "directly from the development team, along with a few additional surprises" during the five-day show in Cologne, Germany that runs August 20-24.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It isn't much to go on, but Blizzard has in recent years used Gamescom for major announcements. Blizzard revealed the release date for the game's current The War Within expansion at Gamescom 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase, for example. While it's still unclear if Midnight will be released this year, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard gave it a definitive release date at the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much is currently known about Midnight. Blizzard announced an entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">trilogy of expansions back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, including Midnight, but only revealed a handful of details about what the expansions beyond The War Within would entail. In Midnight's case, it will see players revisit the homeland of the Blood Elves, Quel'thalas, as they look to stop the forces of the Void from claiming the Sunwell.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the "additional surprises" Blizzard has in store, it's hard to imagine more information about player housing, and a possible release date for the feature, aren't among them. Player housing is easily the most anticipated feature in the MMORPG's 20-year-history, and Blizzard has already teased that it will be coming ahead of Midnight proper, either as part of the expansion's pre-patch update or possibly even sooner. We came away impressed after a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a> decoration tools, stating that even the early test version we played felt loaded with endless possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still plenty to tide WoW players over in the meantime. Blizzard recently revealed what's coming in The War Within's major 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>. The update will introduce the largest raid boss in WoW history as well as asynchronous multiplayer features for Delves that definitely feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">inspired by From Software's Dark Souls series</a>. Players are additionally convinced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Blizzard is teasing a new Demon Hunter specialization</a>--one that could also make for a nice Gamescom surprise.</p>

                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Deus Ex is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, June 23, 2025. Below, we chat with designer Steve Powers about how he created one of the most franchise's most iconic stages.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Steve Powers has never visited Hong Kong, but he’s been there in his dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">As a designer on the original Deus Ex, he walked the city’s in-game streets every day for more than two years. Development was, he says, "a bit of a haze" of hard work and at least once, when he closed his eyes at night, he saw those virtual canals and neon-lit alleys: those sides of meat hanging in the market and the fog draping a temple in the city center.</p><p dir="ltr">Powers, the lead designer of the Hong Kong level, says he wanted to give players a "John Woo fever dream"--and 25 years after the immersive-sim classic was released, the space he created feels as evocative, generous, and extravagant as it did then, from its underground nightclub flashing with strobe lights to the precarious balconies a dozen floors up, coaxing the player to leap into the grey night.</p><p dir="ltr">Hong Kong is just one of 13 levels in Deus Ex, but it feels like a game hub in itself. It is a warren; its connected spaces feel, at once, utterly unique and yet still from the same world, or at least the same mind. From speaking to Powers on a video call from his home in Texas, it’s clear that Hong Kong’s undeniable flow comes from his singular, personal, and admittedly inauthentic vision of what that city should feel like--and from a clear desire to reward players’ curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">He was one of four designers who each owned a chunk of Deus Ex, and these pieces had prescribed inputs and outputs. For Hong Kong, the player--JC Denton--is arriving to learn more about shadowy antagonists Majestic 12 and the mysterious Maggie Chow, as well as to find the scientist Tracer Tong so they can neutralize their self-destruct "kill switch". The player must leave Hong Kong having learned the truth about the links between Majestic 12 and a worldwide plague, and having acquired a powerful weapon for the game’s second half: the iconic, glowing Dragon's Tooth Sword.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519129" data-ratio="1.4230139230139" data-width="4884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519129"></a><figcaption>Maggie Chow concept art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519129-maggiechow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Within those parameters, Powers had near-total creative freedom. Developer Ion Storm couldn’t pay for a Hong Kong trip, so he drew on his love of the action director John Woo, and turned to the monumental book collection of the game’s director, Warren Spector. "He had a giant shelf full of picture books from Hong Kong, so I’d literally flip through those and put post-its on pages," he says. "That's where it came from: John Woo, Hollywood, and stacks and stacks of books."</p><p dir="ltr">The image in his head was of a busy, smoky street at night, lit only by vertical neon signs--that became Tonnochi Road, named after the real-life Tonnochy Road in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district. He bolted bits on, "like building with LEGO," and this unguided, free-flowing approach led to "happy coincidences."</p><p dir="ltr">For example, he created a tall building and hollowed out a cosy apartment, designed so that players could learn more about their brother, Paul Denton. Powers went into the engine and peered out the window, as a player would.</p><p dir="ltr">"And there's this tall building [opposite], and I think, it'd be cool if I could see something up there. And then the pieces just start coming out of that--oh, that’s where Maggie Chow [should] live. If I was Paul Denton, I could be spying on her from here." Immediately, he hopped over the road and built Chow’s apartment, where the player will later find the Dragon’s Tooth Sword.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way I like to work is just to get in a level that’s blocked out, and put on my 'player glasses,'" Powers says. "I’m not going to think about level design, or the academic principles of making a game, I just go, 'What do I want to do right now?'</p><p dir="ltr">"I love getting to a place and looking down and you get a little tingle in your tummy because it’s so high up … And I want to run, and leap over a chasm, and land on a balcony on the other side. That sounds cool. And then I figure out why it’s there after the fact." In the finished game, players can indeed leap from Maggie Chow’s building to that first apartment Powers built.</p><p dir="ltr">His building upwards and outwards was by no means random, he says, and was guided both by the plot--players must visit a market, a club, a triad base, and a hidden laboratory belonging to the VersaLife corporation--and by a desire for changes of rhythm. But the result feels serendipitous. You know when you turn a corner that the music, the color palette, and the vibe will shift, and you’ll find something worth investigating.</p><p dir="ltr">In replaying the game, I visit Hong Kong’s canals and get lost on its walkways, passing barges and rowing boats. I take a narrow alley, emerging into a frosty room with meat hanging on hooks and a figure lurking in the shadows. Powers made that space, a freezer room for the Old China Hand waterside bar, specifically to break up the warm neon colors of Hong Kong with cool blues, he says.</p><p dir="ltr">His desire for a huge, varied world made adapting to player choice, a hallmark of Deus Ex, more complicated. Players are supposed to meet Maggie Chow before finding the Dragon Tooth’s Sword, which will, in turn, prove her part in a major conspiracy. But her apartment has multiple entrances, including through a skylight, and you can break in to find the sword without talking to her. If that happens, she’ll confront the player much later on, berating them for their "terrible manners".</p><p dir="ltr">"For every single opportunity I would give the player to do things out of order, it exponentially complicated some logic," says Powers. "What is Maggie Chow going to say to you if you already have the sword the first time you meet her?"</p><p dir="ltr">That, to many players, and to Powers, is the joy of Deus Ex. "What are all the things the player could've done before getting here, and let's have the game respond, make sure that's accounted for. It makes the game feel alive and real."</p><p dir="ltr">You can break the fiction, "but it holds together just enough where sympathetic players create their own logical leaps," Powers says. "If the player has enough reason to believe that everything is accounted for, then when they're presented with something that doesn't work out that way, they'll solve it themselves--they'll help us out a little bit."</p><p dir="ltr">It’s easy to become one of those sympathetic players in Hong Kong. You not only forgive leaps of logic, but you begin telling stories in your head to fill in the graphical gaps and the empty streets--about why that canal boat is parked right next to that freezer room, for example. "The fidelity is really lacking in Hong Kong," Powers says, "but the idea is, let’s show how this world actually works. A barge comes in from the bay and down the canal and comes here, and offloads all these frozen goods, and this is where they store them for the kitchen. I wanted it to make sense as a liveable space."</p><p dir="ltr">Not every part of Hong Kong has aged well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519134" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519134"></a><figcaption>The market area in Deus Ex.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4519134-market.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even at the time, the local accents sounded like exaggerated stereotypes. Powers recalls criticism after the game was released. But many of the characters, he says, were voiced by local people--they just weren’t professionals. "I remember getting dinged, 'The accents are so weird and fake,' and I was like, that was real people from Hong Kong reading those lines. They were just bad actors so it came across as stilted and weird."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters, however, were voiced by Western actors, including both Maggie Chow and Tracer Tong. Powers says he wasn’t involved in the casting and recording, but knows that, for most of the team, it was the first fully voiced game many of them had worked on.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm certain that a number of things would be done differently today," he says. "On Prey and Redfall we cast actors that suited the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the characters, and when we had writers generating dialog for a culture that wasn't their own, we hired the appropriate consultants to review and comment on the content so that we could adjust. I'm sure if we were making Deus Ex today, we'd have similar values."</p><p dir="ltr">This is not an authentic version of Hong Kong. "Anyone going to Hong Kong is not going to see any of this," he says. He’s "sure it was on his mind" that he was portraying a different culture and that people from Hong Kong might play the game, but "there's never any intent to do anything other than to do a respectful presentation [of local culture]. That was the hope."</p><p dir="ltr">This is Steve Powers’ version of Hong Kong, his own "John Woo fever dream", his vision of a city.</p><p dir="ltr">As if to illustrate the point, Powers even modelled one of his body parts into the game, after programmers on the team showed him how to make complex shapes, he says.</p><p dir="ltr">It sits on a plinth in the lobby to the VersaLife headquarters, reflecting off the red marble floor, and slides back to reveal an underground laboratory where the Gray Death, the plague threatening the world, is being manufactured.</p><p dir="ltr">It is a giant hand, reaching towards the player, grasping at a globe, a metaphor for power.</p><p dir="ltr">On our call, Powers stretches his fingers towards his webcam.</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s this hand."</p>
