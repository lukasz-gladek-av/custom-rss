                <p>If you need a little sci-fi survival action, developer Creepy Jar has announced that its upcoming game StarRupture is about to get a three-day closed playtest. Between July 29-31, fans will be able to try out the single-player portion of this multiplayer title. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3dPFaGz00" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3D3dPFaGz00" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>StarRupture casts players as prisoners who have been sentenced to a penal colony world called Arcadia-7. But instead of being confined in a single physical building, the entire world is your prison and only the best can survive and endure in this harsh environment.</p><p>Fans can sign up for the playtest on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5DMXc4NkRhZFp4UFNTRGFkSlNGRTV2SzVFd3xBQ3Jtc0ttajRsTXFFdDBqQmM1TDBJMlpON0JNbTVNTWg3aTNiajJmdUNHNUdIUmpCMVJWNnQxTXpMQjhKbC1CMFBOOGZaOFJtbWZYUVctb2xqT09ybm9SaTR5bjJrRjZpb05nX3JBOXNIYWt5cWttVld2OGRxUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1631270%2FStarRupture%2F%3Futm_source%3DYT_playtest_announcement_video&amp;v=3D3dPFaGz00" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarRupture's Steam page</a>. When the co-op is active, up to four players can work together in this world. In the meantime, the single-player playtest will focus on letting players build bases and explore, and build up their survival and combat skills. Character progression will allow players to unlock new mods and new buildings. Additionally, players will be able to customize their abilities to match their play styles. </p><p>Players aren't entirely acting on their own. The corporations behind this penal planet have ordered everyone there to work on a factory and gather resources. The companies don't necessarily care whether players meet their end at the claws of some of the "bloodthirsty enemies" who are native to Arcadia-7.</p><p>StarRupture is expected hit early-access this fall.</p>
