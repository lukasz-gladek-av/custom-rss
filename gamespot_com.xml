                <p>Ubisoft has announced the newest crossover collaboration in Rainbow Six Siege, and it's none other than Prime Video's The Boys TV show. Two of the show's stars, Homelander and Black Noir, are now available in the tactical shooter.</p><p>The Boys bundle includes Aces as Homelander and Deimos as Black Noir. The bundle is available for 4080 R6 Credits, which is more than $30. The Homelander and Black Noir characters are available individually for 1944 R6 Credits each. Players get a variety of extras, as well, including a milk bottle charm for Homelander--and anyone who's seen the show or is aware of the lore knows what that means.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjHaAVThy3w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KjHaAVThy3w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Homelander and Black Noir, along with other characters from The Boys, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">previously came to Call of Duty as DLC characters.</a> Homelander also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-teaser-shows-first-look-at-homelander-in-action/1100-6523183/" data-ref-id="1100-6523183">showed up in Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p><p>Some of Siege's previous licensed collaborations included <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3MEHWKDpMk5NalVOc2I47A/rainbow-six-siege-x-halo-crossover-brings-master-chief-set-for-sledge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-adds-new-rick-and-morty-skins/1100-6502037/" data-ref-id="1100-6502037">Rick and Morty</a>, just to name a few.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-confirms-the-boys-season-5-ahead-of-season-4-premiere/1100-6523429/" data-ref-id="1100-6523429">The Boys Season 5 is now in production</a> and will be the final season of the popular superhero show.

                <p>Anyone who has played an online game has probably encountered a bot at some point that may have negatively impacted their gaming experience. To help address gaming's bot problem, Razer and OpenAI founder Sam Altman's company World have <a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-world-team-up-to-combat-third-party-bots-in-online-games-in-the-age-of-ai-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teamed up</a> to create what's called "Razer ID verified by World AI."</p><p>It's a new single sign-on (SSO) proof-of-human system that verifies if a player is a human or a bot. If it all goes to plan, it will create a situation where anyone using a Razer ID account will be verified as a human, which could in turn help bolster "trust and security in the digital space," Razer said.</p><p>"Fair play starts with real players, and Razer ID's ability to integrate into games to enable 'human-only' gameplay modes is key to fostering fair competition and a more trusted gaming environment," the company stated.</p><p>Numerous games are negatively impacted by bots, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">including Team Fortress 2</a>. Steps have been taken to address the issues, but on some level, the problems persist in that game and others. </p><p>Players need a verified <a href="https://world.org/faqs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World ID account</a> for all of this, and that involves scanning their passport or visiting an <a href="https://world.org/find-orb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orb location in the real world</a> to have your faced scanned to create a unique iris code.</p><p>The SSO will come to life first in the futuristic blockchain video game Tokyo Beast. The game utilizes NFTs, which makes it a prime candidate for potential bot spam. Take a look at the video below to learn more about how the new system will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ficNZwDYy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ficNZwDYy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Razer chief corporate officer Wei-Pin Choo said, "To foster fair competition, developers must be able to build trusted, human-only game experiences that keep AI bots out."</p><p>World, which was founded by Altman and Alex Blania, is a technology company that anonymously confirms a person's identity while claiming to ensure their privacy.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 was a colossal hit for Larian Studios, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian walking away from the franchise</a>, toy juggernaut Hasbro is picking up the sword and shield and journeying on. Hasbro, which also owns all things Dungeons and Dragons, announced recently that the future of Baldur's Gate will be announced fairly soon, but not even a hint of what's to come.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Hasbro digital games SVP Dan Ayoub confirmed during this week's Game Developers Conference that there are plans for Baldur's Gate and that there's a lot of interest in the potential of the franchise.</p><p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," he said. Making sure games like Baldur's Gate remain relevant aligns with what Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">back in November</a> of last year.</p><p>At the time, Cocks stated that there will be more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons video games on the way. Could this also mean Baldur's Gate 4 included in the grand scheme of things? Ayoub certainly feels that it's inevitable, but nothing is in the works yet.</p><p>"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he continued. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach. We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p>The final patch for Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-now-live-will-test-cross-play-and-split-screen-co-op/1100-6529081/" data-ref-id="1100-6529081">arrived in January</a> and included--finally--cross-play and 12 new subclasses. </p>
