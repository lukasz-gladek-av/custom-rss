                <p dir="ltr">NASA will be hosting its first-ever Twitch stream from the International Space Station (ISS) next week. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the announcement via its official X (formerly Twitter) account, and shared some details on what viewers can expect from the stream.</p><p dir="ltr">"This Twitch event from space is the first of many," said Brittany Brown, who directs NASA's Office of Communications Digital and Technology Division. "We spoke with digital creators at TwitchCon about their desire for streams designed with their communities in mind, and we listened. In addition to our spacewalks, launches, and landings, we’ll host more Twitch-exclusive streams like this one. Twitch is one of the many digital platforms we use to reach new audiences and get them excited about all things space."</p><p>The stream itself will take place on the ISS--roughly 250 miles above Earth's surface--and will feature appearances from NASA astronauts Don Pettit (who is currently aboard the ISS) and Matt Dominick (who recently returned to Earth after participating in NASA's Crew-8 mission). The spacefaring duo will discuss topics like daily life aboard the ISS and the microgravity experiments currently being performed on board, while also highlighting "ways for Twitch users to engage with NASA, including citizen science projects and science, technology, engineering, and math programs designed to inspire the Artemis Generation."</p><p dir="ltr">The Artemis Generation refers to the astronauts who will explore Earth's moon as a part of NASA's Artemis Program.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon," the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/" rel="nofollow ">official Artemis Program website</a> reads. "NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time NASA has conducted a Twitch livestream, nor is it the first time the agency has broadcast a livestream from the ISS. But according to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-goes-live-first-twitch-stream-from-space-station/" rel="nofollow ">official NASA website</a>, "This conversation will be the first NASA event [livestreamed] from the International Space Station developed specifically for the agency’s Twitch platform."</p><p>The stream will take place on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa">NASA's Twitch channel</a> on Wednesday, February 12 at 8:45 AM PT / 11:45 AM ET.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may be a work of art, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6528863/" data-ref-id="1100-6528863">Patch 8</a> remains a work in progress. A select group of players were invited to take part in Larian Studios' stress test for Patch 8, which is still ongoing. However, Larian has already put together an update that addresses some of the bugs that have been uncovered in Patch 8.</p><p>As laid out in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/stress-test-update-1_135" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new post by Larian Studios</a>, there don't appear to be any game-breaking bugs in Patch 8. But there are issues that have come up in several areas, including the newly added Photo Mode. Now, creatures will supposedly obey the "look at the camera" command, and dragonborn won't lose their tails in the pictures. </p><p>Cross-play is another big addition of Patch 8, which is meant to connect players from consoles and PCs. This update only has a small number of fixes, but Larian notes that "we are still investigating instances of cross-play not working as intended." Other changes are meant to smooth out unintended effects, including an "issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit."</p><p>Patch 8 Update 1 is expected to go live later today, but only for Baldur's Gate 3 players who were invited to take part in the stress test. Everyone else will get the complete Patch 8 after it receives refinement from Larian. After Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio will turn its full attention to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 is almost certainly going to get a sequel, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by another studio</a>.</p><p>You can find the Patch 8 Update 1 notes below.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing Oath of the Crown paladins to lose spell slots instead of gaining them when levelling up.</li><li>Fixed an issue where picking up items from the ground in multiplayer could then block movement via the controller stick.</li><li>Fixed the Wild Shape: Panther's Prowl action and Prowling condition not working correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where items getting added to the inventory would lose their conditions. This could cause, for example, the Elemental Cleaver buff to disappear when the imbued weapon is thrown.</li><li>Shadow Blade will now retain the behavior of being locked to the caster when upcast.</li></ul><h3>Photo Mode</h3><ul><li>Added an in-game pop-up for Photo Mode that triggers at the beach at the start of the game and can be found in the Journal.</li><li>Updated Photo Mode's screenshot function on Steam Deck so that it uses Steam's proprietary screenshot function, so you can access your photos more readily from the Steam Screenshots page.</li><li>Prevented characters from being able to pop into private cutscenes while activating Photo Mode when playing in multiplayer.</li><li>Hid the 'Toggle Photo Preview' legend while taking screenshots via Steam's screenshot function.</li><li>Fixed Photo Mode making the screen go blurry when opened on split screen.</li><li>Added camera shutter SFX when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li><li>Fixed the Attacking and Jumping poses for wolves.</li><li>Fixed a cross appearing in the middle of the screen when the Vignette is at its thickest setting.</li><li>Fixed some creatures not listening when you select the 'Look At Camera' option.</li><li>Fixed the game sometimes freezing when switching quickly between tabs in Photo Mode.</li><li>Improved the Depth of Field sliders so the strength and distance scale in proportion to the slider itself.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing dragonborn tails to appear detached from the body.</li><li>The Grasping Vine's poses now work correctly.</li></ul><h3>Cross-Play</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that could get the client stuck in a loading screen if the client unfriends the host and then clicks 'Join Party' after re-adding the host.</li><li>Fixed some of the PS5 splashscreens not showing up when they should.</li><li>Fixed a crash at the start of combat.</li></ul><h3>Subclasses</h3><ul><li>The Booming Blade tooltip now updates its values when upcast.</li><li>Fixed an inaccurate bonus value in the Rakish Audacity tooltip.</li><li>Updated Toll the Dead and Bursting Sinew to work with Potent Cantrip and deal half damage on saves.</li><li>Fixed Pact of the Blade's Extra Attack being added to Deepened Pact even if you didn't choose Pact of the Blade.</li></ul><h3>Art</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Gale's donation UI preventing you from feeding him magical items.</li><li>All of the Hexblade's class actions and subclass features are now shown correctly in Character Creation.</li><li>Fixed button or keyboard shortcut inputs in the UI sometimes not working.</li><li>Fixed some Reaction tooltips like Divine Allegiance not showing some values correctly in the description.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing the UI to lock up when rapidly switching between keyboard and mouse input and controller input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where opening the Main Menu on controller wouldn't automatically select the 'Resume' option at the top of the menu.</li><li>Fixed the condition icons on the party line getting duplicated when transitioning between acts during cross-play.</li><li>Fixed some settings that were missing their wrap-around navigation functionality on controller, preventing you from looping from the last option back to the first option with the same button input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you'd have to deselect your current passive when respeccing a character before selecting a new one. Now, you can just click the new one.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the toggleable Illithid Powers to disappear from the Character Sheet and be uninteractable in the Illithid Powers UI.</li><li>Fixed player avatars not showing up in the multiplayer/cross-play lobby.</li></ul><h3>Scripting</h3><ul><li>With 12 new subclasses arriving in Patch 8, we’ve rechecked some achievements, including ensuring the armed version of Stunning Strike no longer counts as an unarmed attack for the Fists of Fury achievement, and its unarmed variant now does.</li><li>Monks' Unarmed Strike bonus action now also correctly counts toward the Action Surge achievement.</li></ul><h3>Crashes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash when trying to start a game from a lobby multiple times.</li><li>Fixed several crashes and freezes related to the UI.</li><li>Fixed a crash on Vulkan when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li></ul>
