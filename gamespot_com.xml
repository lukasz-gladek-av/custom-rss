                <p>After being announced back at the beginning of the year, the free-to-play role-playing game DC Worlds Collide is officially live. The game is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play for mobile devices and PC. DC Worlds Collide has a lot to offer for DC fans, with over 10 play modes and over 70 characters from the DC pantheon.</p><p>Similar to Marvel Mystic Mayhem, DC fans can choose from over 70 fan-favorite characters and not just A-listers like Superman, but also Zatanna, Cheetah, and Jessica Cruz. The game's story draws from iconic events like Trinity War and Forever Evil, where the Crime Syndicate used Pandora's Box to open a portal to escape their dying planet and invade Earth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehOprOX2rQ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ehOprOX2rQ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Coinciding with the upcoming release of James Gunn's Superman film, that version of Big Blue will be the first new character to join the roster in DC Worlds Collide. He'll be sporting his movie-inspired looks and will be available in-game starting on July 9, quickly joined by Guy Gardner, Mister Terrific, and Krypto, arriving later this summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527278"></a><figcaption>Superman features his costume from the upcoming movie.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527278-dcwc-superman%28dcu%291.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527287,1300-4527288,1300-4527289,1300-4527290,1300-4527291,1300-4527294,1300-4527296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527287-dcwc-characterfiles_superman.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527288-dcwc-convergence.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527289-dcwc-elitearena.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527290-dcwc-mainstages.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527291-dcwc-reinforcements_batmobilegameplay.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527294-dcwc-warworld_leaderboard.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4527296-dcwc-superman%28dcu%29characterinfo.png"></figure><p>"Players will need to strategize on elements such as character selection, traits, team positioning, order of skills, and more to effectively counter enemy skills, compositions, buffs, and weaknesses," the game's official synopsis reads. "As players progress, they can also collect Artifacts and Reinforcements to further boost their teams, uncover team synergies between characters to unlock unique buffs, as well as experiment with new combinations and interactions to take on even greater challenges."</p><p>Players can challenge six individual bosses from the Crime Syndicate in Evil Falls, face off against other players to climb the leaderboard in Warworld, and join a League to band together with other players in co-op events. Overall, DC Worlds Collide features 12 additional event types and five minigames for players to try out and earn rewards, as well as new characters, and they can even practice weapon training with Deathstroke.</p>

                <p>The Mega Man franchise has largely been dormant since 2018 when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mega-man-11-review-an-uneven-retro-romp/1900-6417003/" data-ref-id="1900-6417003">Mega Man 11</a> was released. Aside from the title character's guest appearances in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a><span> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, there haven't been many Mega Man sightings since. However, Capcom recently addressed Mega Man's potential future and stated that the franchise remains "important" to the company. </span></p><p><span>During <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2025capcom_c.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent shareholder Q&amp;A</a> (via <a href="https://noisypixel.net/capcom-mega-man-46th-shareholders-meeting/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Noisy Pixel</a>), Capcom was asked about plans for Mega Man, and a company spokesperson replied, "</span><span>The Mega Man series is one of our most important IPs, and we are continuously </span>considering ways to develop it further. However, we do not have any additional information we can share at this time." Capcom's representative went on to note that there is "a particularly high volume of inquiries" about Mega Man from overseas markets without elaborating any further. </p><p>The company's latest remarks are very similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-hasnt-been-forgotten-capcom-insists/1100-6525220/" data-ref-id="1100-6525220">to a Mega Man update from 2024</a>, where Capcom noted that it is "considering how to create games for it on an ongoing basis." While the classic games in the series are readily available online, there's been no word about any further sequels.</p><p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mega-man-live-action-movie-is-finally-official/1100-6462263/" data-ref-id="1100-6462263">a live-action Mega Man movie was in development</a> at 20th Century Fox. Project Power directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-movie-directors-will-have-more-news-to-sh/1100-6480182/" data-ref-id="1100-6480182">Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost were signed</a> to helm the film. Subsequently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-live-action-project-coming-to-netflix-report/1100-6498935/" data-ref-id="1100-6498935">a live-action Mega Man project</a> was set up at Netflix in 2021, although it was unclear if that was meant to be in place of the movie. So far, there haven't been any concrete developments with that project.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Just days after its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/">Game Pass release</a>, Activision has taken the PC version of Call of Duty: WWII offline. The publisher didn't provide specific details on the issue, but the game's removal comes shortly after severe hacking claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players are pretty familiar with hacking situations in multiplayer and Warzone, but the ones seemingly plaguing the 2017 World War II shooter weren't the average variety of aimbots or wall hackers. The hacks reportedly being used in Call of Duty: WWII were RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks, meaning players were losing control of their PCs through a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Call of Duty players posted clips on social media to spread awareness on the hacking issue before the game was pulled, showing their PCs being hacked while playing WWII. One of the viral clips from the weekend comes from "<a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053" rel="nofollow ">Wrioh</a>," who shows an apparent RCE attack during a multiplayer match.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: WWII<br>Call of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Activision didn't acknowledge these security risks with the game, and it instead made a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a> on July 4 to simply announce Call of Duty: WWII was brought offline on PC while it investigates reports of "an issue." There's also no mention of when the game will return to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are still plenty of Call of Duty games available to play. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both feature the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> content, which includes new game modes, cel-shaded map variants, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head limited-time event</a>.
