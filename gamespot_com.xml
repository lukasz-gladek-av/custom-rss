<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was incredibly moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johann and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>

During the Konami Press Start showcase, the company announced that a goofier side of Metal Gear Solid will return, as the Secret Theater bonus feature will be included in the upcoming game. Not only will it feature all of the classic cutscenes from Snake Eater, but several new ones have been created for it as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="204">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=204" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Secret Theater was originally an unlockable extra in Snake Eater that reimagined the endings to several cutscenes. These ranged from Snake causing a time paradox to legendary sniper The End falling in love with Eva, and the videos were originally only made for the eyes of Snake Eater's production team.</p><p>These short clips were eventually placed on the official Snake Eater website, and several more were created thanks to them being popular with fans. The original videos will be found as collectibles inside the game, and for the new Secret Theater videos, players will have to track down enemy soldiers carrying rolls of film on their uniforms.</p><p>Konami also revealed a few more extras that'll be in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater when it launches on August 28, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">like a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a>, an Ape Escape crossover on PC and PS5, and a Snake vs. Bomberman mode that'll be exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S version of the game.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, the horror film titans at Blumhouse announced a video games label and brought its first game as a publisher, Fear The Spotlight, to Summer Game Fest. I eventually reviewed that one and found it to be a worthy entry-level horror game. It was creepy, but not overly scary, and made for a reasonable gateway into the genre for younger or less experienced players. At Summer Game Fest 2025, Blumhouse showed off two more games that, while perhaps not specifically for beginners, do well to express Blumhouse Games' publishing vision.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grave-seasons/" data-ref-id="5000-631819">Grave Seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols/" data-ref-id="5000-601756">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> are each horror games, but couldn't be more different otherwise. The former is 2D, the latter is 3D. Grave Seasons is presented in third-person, while Crisol is played in first-person. Grave Seasons is also a dark twist on farming sims, whereas Crisol blends elements of recent Resident Evil games with BioShock, all set in a world inspired by Spanish art and folklore. Blumhouse brought these two games to Summer Game Fest 2025, giving me a preview of what's to come from a publisher that is technically still in its infancy, but also carries the name recognition and reputation of one of modern horror's biggest brands.</p><p dir="ltr">In the movie world, it feels like one out of every two horror films displays Blumhouse's logo in their opening moments. While I'm sure that's not literally true, it's certainly the case that the production company has its hands in all kinds of horror productions, from major series like The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to legendary one-offs like Get Out and 2020's remake of The Invisible Man. The prospect of the company getting into horror video games is an exciting one for me, as I hope the publisher can use a keen eye to lift notable projects out of obscurity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gj9vincgw4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Gj9vincgw4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We have this internal saying: 'We're making all different flavors of horror games for everyone,' Blumhouse's Ara Josefsson told me after my demos with the publisher's SGF 2025 slate. "People think of horror, and maybe they have a very siloed perception of what that would be based on where they come from. Is it body horror? Is it jump scares? But there's actually a pretty big spectrum of what horror games are. I think our future games will impress upon that as well."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Grave Seasons and Crisol, Blumhouse has already announced several future games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleep-awake/" data-ref-id="5000-631820">Sleep Awake</a> is a first-person horror adventure from the interesting pairing of Spec Ops: The Line's director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' guitarist Robin Finck about a dystopian world without sleep. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simulation/" data-ref-id="5000-631821">The Simulation</a> is a VR title about investigating a horror game not known to have existed before. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-c/" data-ref-id="5000-615695">Project C</a>, admittedly the one I'm personally most excited about, is the next Sam Barlow game, and this time he's enlisted Brandon Cronenberg for what is likely to be something gruesome, if the latter's filmography is a reliable clue about the mysterious game.</p><p dir="ltr">Grave Seasons' pitch is perhaps the most compelling of the whole list so far, though. The game's Stardew-like setup soon gives way to a violent murder--and a murder mystery follows. Blending the gameplay elements of something like a Stardew Valley with a story about a serial killer seems poised to toy with the genre's usual romance angles and gamified friendships. I'm eager to see how the game might spin the neighborhood cast of characters into a whodunnit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oNGQ4KWPg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y5oNGQ4KWPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Crisol's art style was impressive, too, and I'm most looking forward to playing this one in the developers' native language, Spanish, once it releases. The gunplay was rough in my demo, as aiming down sights proved to be unreliable, but I'm hoping that gets improved before it releases later this year. Making up for that roughness was the game's clever wrinkle: You reload your gun with your own blood, so you'll have to balance your ammo against your own health. In my time with the game, I found myself having to combat my habit of reloading after every encounter, which added a challenging layer to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two things I've found to be true about horror fans: rarely do they like just one kind of horror, and often they're obsessive about the genre. Blumhouse isn't the only games label pulling diverse, smaller-sized horror projects into the limelight--DreadXP has been doing it for years and Critical Reflex is a new label showing signs of similar intentions--but like Annapurna does for weird (complimentary) art games, Blumhouse's name recognition does some heavy lifting for the horror games it signs. Even if, like Blumhouse's movies, they don't all prove to be winners, I'm looking forward to experimenting with whatever projects they reveal for the foreseeable future.</p>

The zombies won't be the only threat players need to fear, as the update adds new dynamic weather to survive. Each biome will have its own unique storm, and each one will feature a different scale of difficulty to survive. These are deadly and only give players a short amount of time to seek or build shelter before they start taking damage.</p>
