                <p>Gail Simone, an award-winning writer known for her work on the DC franchise, has confirmed she was involved with the Wonder Woman game at Monolith that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">just recently canceled</a>.</p><p>Simone, the longest-running female writer on the Wonder Woman series, <a href="https://x.com/gailsimone/status/1894548068336636025?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> she was asked to do long-term consulting on the game and jumped at the chance. "It was a perfect storm of stuff I adore," she said. "Wonder Woman, video games, and one of my favorite game studios: Monolith."</p><p>Simone went on to say Monolith's Wonder Woman game was "gorgeous and expansive." She said "every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great Wonder Woman game.

a-game. Programmers, artists, designers, everyone. I don't know that I have ever worked with a team that cared more about making sure the end product was perfect," she said. "It was a dream come true. Wonder Woman had a dream team and they put their all into it. They made sure it had Wonder Woman and DC lore on every aspect of the game. It was a thrill and honor to work with them."</p><p>Simone said she understands there is a lot of "finger-pointing going on" now around why the game was canceled, but everyone she worked with at Monolith and WB was "enthusiastic and supportive."</p><p>Games, TV shows, movies, and all other types of media projects fall apart regularly, for any number of reasons, and the Wonder Woman game joins them.</p><p>"Sometimes, you give your all and it doesn't work out. But that was an amazing team and I can only hope they continue to make brilliant games. Someone is going to snap them all up and set a new industry standard, I know it," Simone said.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was announced in 2021, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">more than $100 million was reportedly spent</a> on it prior to its cancellation. In confirming the game's cancellation and the closure of Monolith, management said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">did not align with WB's new strategic pursuits</a>, despite projects in the DC franchise being one of WB's four core pillars going forward for games.</p><p>WB management said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones. As part of this new strategy of focusing on only the biggest franchises, WB is producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>, while WB Games Montreal is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones title</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, may be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">plotting a new single-player Batman game</a>. As for DC, studio boss James Gunn recently said some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">"really interesting" projects are coming in the gaming space, but not soon.</a> As for the Mortal Kombat series, NetherRealm has not announced any new games, but it's expected the studio will continue the franchise with a new installment at some point.</p><p>In addition to the cancellation of Wonder Woman and closure of Monolith, WB is shuttering MultiVersus studio Player First Games and WB San Diego. MultiVersus is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/" data-ref-id="1100-6529169">shutting down this May. </a></p><p>Warner Bros. Games' longtime boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he's leaving the company but will stay on for the next three months to help oversee the transition to a new leader. No such executive has been named yet for Haddad's replacement.</p>

                <p>Last fall, Microsoft unveiled an initiative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a>, even if it isn't on Game Pass. February's Xbox Update moves that agenda forward with over 50 playable games that Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now access on any supported devices as long as they own the titles.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/25/xbox-february-update-invite-links-cloud-gaming-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox's official site</a>, the following titles were among the recently added games that players can stream from their own collection.</p><ul><li>Blasphemous 2</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Slime Rancher 2</li><li>Subnautica</li><li>Subnautica: Below Zero</li><li>The Talos Principle 2</li><li>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</li></ul><p>Additionally, streaming support for the titles below will be added soon.</p><ul><li>Atomic Heart</li><li>Cult of the Lamb</li><li>Hotline Miami</li><li>Killer Frequency</li><li>Neva</li><li>Overcooked! All You Can Eat</li><li>Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate</li><li>Serious Sam Collection</li><li>Trepang2</li><li>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</li></ul><p>The latest update also makes it easier for Game Pass Ultimate members to invite their friends to take part in their Xbox Cloud Gaming beta sessions. For multiplayer titles, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can send out a single invite link via DM, group chat, or even on social media. In addition to consoles, this feature will work on web browsers and supported TVs if all players involved have an Xbox account as well a copy of the game. Some games will require Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions as well. The upper limit of players who can join using the invite link is determined by the number of users that each game allows.</p><p>Microsoft's network-quality indicator is now available to everyone participating in the Xbox Cloud Gaming beta. This tool is meant to help players detect any potential problems with their network connections, and also to keep track of the quality of those connections when using Cloud Gaming on supported devices.</p><p>Reports from last year indicated that Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-planning-for-direct-to-cloud-controllers-and-higher-quality-streams-report/1100-6527246/" data-ref-id="1100-6527246">direct-to-stream controllers and even-higher quality streams</a> for the future of the Cloud Gaming service. However, those improvements have yet to be implemented or officially announced.</p>
