                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has congratulated Kepler Interactive and Sandfall Interactive on the launch of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 by way of a custom art piece showing a bunch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">"adoring fans"</a> from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion having a fun time booting up Expedition 33.</p><p>The context here is that Oblivion Remastered surprise-launched on April 22, just days before Expedition 33 arrived on April 24. Given that both Oblivion Remastered and Expedition 33 were day-one launch titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>, some wondered if Expedition 33 might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">overshadowed by Oblivion Remastered. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what impact, if any, both games releasing on Game Pass so closely to each other might have. The Expedition 33 developers have also <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915377120332677134" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reacted positively to Oblivion Remastered</a> and have noted how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">both games can successfully co-exist (of course)</a>.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered (Virtuos) and Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) were developed by French studios, so the teams have that in common as well. </p><p>Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG featuring characters played by people like The Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis, Daredevil's Charlie Cox, and Final Fantasy actor Ben Starr. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-joins-the-list-of-gestating-live-action-movie-adaptations/1100-6529165/" data-ref-id="1100-6529165">Expedition 33 live-action movie</a> was announced in January.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Expedition 33 review</a> scored the game a 9/10, with reviewer Richard Wakeling writing, "There are minor pitfalls in relation to its narrow exploration and some quality-of-life issues, but these missteps aren't enough to significantly detract from a game with all the makings of an RPG classic."</p><p>And if you're just getting started with Oblivion Remastered, you might want to take a peek at GameSpot's breakdown that covers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">everything new and different in the game compared to its original 2006 edition.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Blurry eyes and copious amounts of coffee are defining this Thursday morning for many Nintendo fans, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> went live last night at 12 AM ET at three major big box retailers--Best Buy*, Target, and Walmart. Almost instantly, social media feeds buzzed with jubilant success and bitter defeat, as Switch 2 listings changed from "coming soon" to "sold out."</p><p dir="ltr">Target and Walmart both opened their digital doors right at the announced 12 AM start time, and within seconds Target showed "sold out" warnings on listings for both the Switch 2 console itself and the Mario Kart World bundle. However, this turned out to be a false alarm, and while a few customers reported payment issues at the Target cart page, the big red retail chain emerged as the place most people were having early success--with the Target smartphone app proving particularly effective for some.</p><p dir="ltr">Some users had to effectively mash the "place order" button over and over again for Target's system to finally put the sale through, while others saw their payment methods and addresses disappear at the purchase screen. In a few extreme case, the attempt to purchase a preorder resulted in a fraud alert to their account, and a cancellation of the preorder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805"></a><figcaption>Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Walmart's plan was to create a virtual queue for hopeful customers to file into, which at first seemed like the most efficient route. However, the virtual queue didn't assign anyone a number--at least not one they could <em>see</em>--and the experience turned into a "hurry up and wait" situation. The lines did eventually clear, with many saying that holding the line was bearing fruit, but the uncertainty proved stressful for most whether they succeeded or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Others, meanwhile, were unsuccessful in getting through the queue, and they had to open another tab to start the 10-minute purchase window. At that point, some found they were staring at the timer counting down as the system repeatedly failed to load to their cart. Some were left in the queue even after if had seemingly been disabled, while others were able to purchase a preorder while "skipping" the line. The Walmart listing still has a "preorder" button showing, but it does not indicate that it's sold out yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally there was Best Buy, which you may have noticed was marked with an asterisk above. This is because preorders here didn't begin at 12 AM as advertised; instead, they ended up going live nearly a half-hour later. Best Buy also used a virtual queue system, and it also did not designate a number to each customer's spot in line, so there was no way of knowing how close you were to checking out.</p><p dir="ltr">Best Buy is where I locked in for my preorder, and after the half-hour delay, I found myself in two different virtual queues; one on my browser, and one on my phone via the Best Buy app. After a full 50 minutes of waiting, the browser queue booted me back to an empty cart. Needless to say, I was not happy, but I still had the phone queue going… and going… and going.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd finally given up and was set to leave the line, when I noticed something: In the app, the Switch 2 listing I'd queued for said that "stock was unavailable for shipping" and "stock was unavailable for pickup," but I knew this wasn't true. So, at great risk of missing out on a preorder, I left the original queue, refreshed the page to ensure I could select my home store, and then reentered the queue.</p><p dir="ltr">Two minutes later--and that's not hyperbole, two literal minutes after reentry--I was verifying my account, and a preorder for the Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World was mine. One hour and 40 minutes from the advertised start time, victory was mine. Others who took the same approach weren't as fortunate, however.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you weren't so lucky in last night's preorder chaos, more Switch 2 preorders will be available at GameStop beginning at 8 AM PT or whenever you local store opens for business. Those interested can also sign up at the official Nintendo website for a chance to preorder the console directly from Nintendo, with invitations scheduled to begin on May 8. If you were able to land a preorder and are looking for some accessories, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">those can still be preordered</a> without much trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5. Launch titles for Nintendo's latest console include Mario Kart World, enhanced versions of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and Tears Of The Kingdom, Street Fighter 6, and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

                <p>In 2023, IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser started a new studio, Wombo Games, alongside veteran developers who previously worked on Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex, and Just Cause. Now, Wombo Games is sharing an early look at the company's first game, Raiders of Blackveil, a roguelite action-RPG.</p><p>Raiders of Blackveil has single-player and co-op options for up to three players. The main characters in the game are humanoid animals who live on "a dystopian industrial fantasy world" where the human-controlled Blackveil corporation has forced them into servitude. That's why the animals are launching an armed rebellion against Blackveil to reclaim their freedom and their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923"></a><figcaption>An early screenshot from Raiders of Blackveil.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481924,1300-4481925,1300-4481926,1300-4481927" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"></figure><p>According to Wombo Games, Raiders of Blackveil will be a deeply strategic game that blends "MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot, and PVE extraction gameplay." The game is currently available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser in a statement. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p><p>Early access for Raiders of Blackveil is expected to launch this summer.</p>

The events of the story focused heavily on what the player chose to do, and how they reacted to the consequences of those choices. It was a novel--pardon the pun--approach to Tron, and one that, while not perfect, was effective in expanding the lore of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">This year, Bithell Games will bring us back into its version of the Tron universe in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-tron-catalyst/" data-ref-id="5000-647165">Tron: Catalyst</a>, a follow-up to Identity's story with a new set of characters and an entirely new approach. The visual novel format is gone, replaced with an isometric action-oriented format that gives the player more direct engagement with the world. The shift is a gamble, but based on my experience with the first 90 minutes of the game, it's one that has enough promise that it might pay off in the end.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney TRON Catalyst Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A new identity</h2><p dir="ltr">Those who played Tron: Identity may have a set of expectations with Catalyst, but as mentioned above, those expectations need to be derezzed. Catalyst is a vastly different experience, one that encourages exploration and direct combat over heavy dialogue and puzzle-solving. Where Identity felt more like an Ace Attorney style of game, Catalyst gives the same vibes as Supergiant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a> or, perhaps more accurately given the similar setting, Neon Giant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-ascent/" data-ref-id="5000-511894">The Ascent</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Catalyst's heroine, Exo, must explore parts of the city either on foot or riding the series' iconic Light Cycle--the latter of which she can summon at will. Her travels will match her against members of The Core, the neon-orange-tinged aggressors trying to maintain control of the Arq Grid. Fighting them, on the surface, seems simplistic: Exo can swing her disc for a three-hit combo by tapping the attack button, she can charge up a powerful melee attack by holding the attack button down, and she can defend herself through dodges and timed parry abilities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609"></a><figcaption>Why walk when you can Light Cycle?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">By aiming with the right stick and pressing the throw button, Exo will throw her disc in an enemy's direction, where it will damage them before returning to her. She can ricochet the disc off of walls to try and hit an enemy from behind--which deals more damage--and eventually, she can immediately kick the disc back at a group of enemies when it returns to her for a quick disc throw combo.</p><p dir="ltr">Mastering the disc throw mechanic is going to be the key to success in Catalyst's combat, but it's worth it; landing a hit after choosing the right angle with a disc throw is incredibly satisfying, especially if the enemy is at low health and the hit takes them out. Normal melee attacks are fine, if uninteresting, but coupling them with disc throws makes fighting the Core enemies much more unique.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Thrown through a loop</h2><p dir="ltr">The new focus on action does not mean dialogue has been completely removed, however. Catalyst will still feature back-and-forth dialogue with key characters throughout the game, and choices will still need to be made. However, this time, the branching dialogue is an element in Tron: Catalyst's most intriguing element: Restart.</p><p dir="ltr">If Exo hits a dead end, Catalyst gives her the ability to "restart" the mission she's currently in, while retaining all of the information she's received thus far. While this does technically negate any progress made, it does allow you to approach the mission with a fresh perspective. Maybe the first time through a level, you turned left down a hallway, so this time you know that you should go right. Or, the first time you spoke to a character, you chose one dialogue option and didn't like the outcome, and now you can choose the other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610"></a><figcaption>Catalyst adopts an isometric view.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both chapters that were available in the preview build made heavy use of the Restart mechanic, showing off its full potential rather quickly. In one mission, I alerted the Core to my presence in the first conversation I had, so I had to continuously fight them off as I made progress in the story. However, just before I hit a dead end, a character gave me the ability to shield important data on Exo's disc from scans, meaning that when I restarted the loop and approached the NPC again, I was able to move freely and no one was alerted.</p><p dir="ltr">This looping mechanic is very neat, as it allows you to fully explore a level with fresh eyes as it seamlessly transitions back to the beginning of the area. What's more, if your main mission requires you to restart the loop, the game does not hesitate to tell you--this is important, as it removes the possibility of you aimlessly wandering around the city wondering what to do before realizing you have to restart. It's easy to get lost in this neon-soaked urban paradise, so the friendly reminder is appreciated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611"></a><figcaption>Aspects of Identity's visual novel format are maintained in this sequel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Tron: Catalyst preview build only lasted about 90 minutes, but that's all the time it needed to make a powerful first impression. Some may have been dismayed by Bithell Games's choice to move away from the interactive novel approach of Tron: Identity in favor of an action-based format, but in the short time I spent with Catalyst, that shift seems to be paying off greatly. The looping mechanic is unique and interesting, and combat does just enough to be fun thanks to the strategic element of disc throwing. The dialogue elements aren't as robust, but they serve as an imaginative way to inform future loops in a given level.</p><p dir="ltr">Bithell Games' previous Tron game seems like the studio finding its Identity in this universe; this new entry is shaping up to be the Catalyst for a new flagship franchise for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Tron: Catalyst is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC on June 17.</p>
