                <p>In the lore of Resident Evil, two of the franchise's top villains--Nemesis and Albert Wesker aka The Mastermind--have never crossed paths. But starting today in<span> </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-by-daylight-review-2020-toying-with-terror/1900-6417532/" data-ref-id="1900-6417532">Dead by Daylight</a>'s third collaboration with Resident Evil, Wesker and Nemesis are teaming up as two of the killers in the game's latest 2v8 mode.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has shared a trailer for the new Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil crossover, as Nemesis and Wesker corner a handful of RE's heroes including Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Rebecca Chambers. Among this crew, Jill is the one who has experience fighting Nemesis in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a> and Wesker in some of the other games. But even with backup, Jill and the others are significantly outmatched by this duo.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dead by Daylight | 2v8: Resident Evil Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Dead by Daylight collaborations take place outside of Resident Evil continuity, so the game doesn't have to explain how any of this fits into RE's storylines. But the 2v8 mode does feature a map from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3 that recreates Raccoon City's Police Department. Additionally, Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs can be found and used for healing by the heroes. But if either Wesker or Nemesis find the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a boost of speed.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has previously stated that there will be two survivor bots on every team in this 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. The current Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil collaboration is only running through February 25. But we know of at least one big crossover coming down the line this summer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">Dead by Daylight x Five Nights At Freddy's</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX performance has generated a lot of online chatter, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with Drake. When the Grammy-winning rapper took the stage for the halftime show, the stage itself took the form of a tic-tac-toe board--but X's and O's were accompanied by a triangle and a square, which were meant to evoke the aesthetic of a "PlayStation-style controller," according to the show's coordinators and set designers. The idea--which Lamar personally dreamed up--was meant to represent the rapper's life as though it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people," art director Shelley Rodgers told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="nofollow ">Wired</a>. "A lot of it is showing his journey, [showing him] traveling through the American dream."</p><p dir="ltr">Creative director Mike Carson added that Lamar and his production company, pgLang, are "really into keeping things clean and minimal."</p><p dir="ltr">"We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music," Carson said.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite the stage's streamlined, minimalist design, the folks running the show had several difficult hurdles to overcome. Lamar, his backup dancers, the lighting, and the stage itself had to be set up and ready to go in under eight minutes. Once the performance ended, production had had roughly six minutes to get everything off the field--without messing up the turf. Even though the Superdome's turf is synthetic, protecting it was still no small task, especially given the fact that part of the set dressing was a real GNX that had been heavily modified to allow Lamar's numerous backup dancers to enter the stage in a clown car-esque manner.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were on board with our vision from day one," Carson said of Shelley Rodgers, who worked to bring the vehicular optical illusion to life. "Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line."</p><p dir="ltr">But every good game needs a villain, and the halftime show appeared to serve as the final act in Lamar's seemingly endless beef with fellow rapper Drake. At one point in the show, Lamar told his female backup dancers that he wanted to perform "Not Like Us," but had decided against it because "people like to sue." But near the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 13-minute performance</a>, Lamar performed a lightly censored version of the incredibly popular diss track. The "life as a video game" theme also resurfaced at the end of the show, with Lamar yelling "Game Over!" as the same words appeared in lights across the stadium.</p><p>Drake has yet to make a statement about the halftime performance. Lamar's rival was <a href="https://athlonsports.com/entertainment/drake-kendrick-lamar-reaction-halftime-show-super-bowl-beef" rel="nofollow ">reportedly out of the country</a> during the Super Bowl.</p>

                <p>Valve has seemingly introduced new rules that ban games that require users to watch paid ads (or rely on other such ad-based revenue models) from Steam. However, some sources report that these rules may have already existed, and that Valve has merely created <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="nofollow">a dedicated page</a> on Steamworks to clarify this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">The page explains that Steam does not contain paid advertising, and that advertising-based revenue models are not allowed on the platform. It further states that developers are also prohibited from using advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players an in-game reward for watching or engaging with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rule reads in part. "If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam."</p><p dir="ltr">This apparent change in Valve policy was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" rel="nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="nofollow">SteamDB</a> posted screencaps on BlueSky that seem to show that this policy has been in effect for at least five years on a different page, and that this new page is a dedicated space for it that states it in a different way. Regardless, Valve did recently introduce a significant change to its storefront: warnings that note if a game in Early Access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iibeow/steam_now_warns_about_early_access_that_have_not/" rel="nofollow">hasn't been updated</a> in more than a year. These alerts are ostensibly intended to inform users that the development timeline described on a game's page might not have come to fruition, or if the game has been outright abandoned.</p>

                <p>Since it's only February, it might be too soon to say that the action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is going to be a game of the year contender. But this title's popularity is already exploding. After launching on Steam last week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-off-to-an-enormous-start-on-steam/1100-6529234/" data-ref-id="1100-6529234">150,000 players concurrently</a>, the game hit an even larger peak over the weekend.</p><p>SteamDB has shared <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a chart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's performance</a>, and it rose from 176,000 players on February 5 to 190,000 on February 7. During the weekend, the game reached its current record of 256,206 concurrent players before settling back down to 188,000 players today. Regardless, the upwards trajectory of this title is impressive and it appears to still have room to grow. The game is also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, so the Steam numbers may only represent a small part of the overall picture.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has also been highly rated on GameSpot's sister site, Metacritic, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 88</a>. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-guides-hub/1100-6529183/" data-ref-id="1100-6529183">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> gave it a 9/10.</p><p>Senior designer Ondřej Bittner recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-dev-on-denying-instant-gratification-elder-scrolls-morrowind-influence/1100-6529328/" data-ref-id="1100-6529328">the influence that The Elder Scrolls games</a> have had on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, particularly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-review/1900-2870473/" data-ref-id="1900-2870473">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-review/1900-6168010/" data-ref-id="1900-6168010">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. The game also sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in a single day</a>.
