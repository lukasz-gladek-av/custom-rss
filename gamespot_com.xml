                <p dir="ltr">This year, I decided I'd finally play 2022's Case of the Golden Idol, a mystery game that thrusts you onto the scene of a murder moments after it's happened. You pan through several screens, absorb every detail you possibly can, gather clues in the form of nouns and verbs, and make logic-based deductions by filling in the missing details in passages that tell the story of what occurred there. There are systems in place to guide you in the right direction, and the game begins quite simply, but by its end, I was being pushed to my absolute limit. The first few cases took all of about 10-25 minutes, but the final one in the game seemed to stretch across the span of an entire night. My head was positively bursting with possible motives and culprits, and kudos to Case of the Golden Idol for allowing me the room to be wrong about these cases until I eventually divined the right permutation of terms and cracked the case. It was one of the most frustrating ends of a game ever, and I was enamored of the whole experience.</p><p dir="ltr">I bring up Case of the Golden Idol and this frustration because, overwhelmingly, many of 2024's best games provided me with that very same feeling. These stellar titles, like Animal Well, Rise of the Golden Idol, and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are composed of what seems like countless of the most nefarious and confounding puzzles I've come across, some of which still vex and evade me to this day. And yet, despite that recurring headache--brought on by slamming my head into a proverbial wall over and over again--I wouldn't trade the experiences I had with them for anything.</p><p dir="ltr">I was wrong a lot in Rise of the Golden Idol, 2024's sequel to the aforementioned Case. I frequently confused names and aliases, and as the levels grew in scale (and the scenarios grew in complexity), I missed a lot of smaller details in the immaculately rendered environs that had been planted to provide insight and direction. I misunderstood the events of the game on numerous occasions, and was more surprised than usual at the revelations that were revealed by a level's end. Rise of the Golden Idol was thoroughly frustrating, and yet it's clearly one of the best games I've played all year because when I pushed it, it pushed back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886"></a><figcaption>The Rise of the Golden Idol</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Rise of the Golden Idol's increasingly challenging cases urged me to think harder about the conclusions I was coming to. In my favorite of these cases, a man in an apartment complex is washing what appears to be a bloody stain from his shirt, leading me to believe that he was the epicenter of an inciting event that recently affected this community. Having taken the bait, I operated under the guise that I was correct until the game brutally rejected my conclusion and challenged me to make actual deductions rather than be shepherded to a point via obvious breadcrumb trails. It trusted me to figure things out.</span></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of my favorite games this year similarly refused to provide me with easy and obvious answers. I'm not entirely sure Animal Well has anything even remotely resembling a proper resolution. I mean, there's an ending to work towards, but the game also withholds so many more secrets that I may never see, and that's a thrilling and distinct relationship to have to a game when 100% completion guides are available online within days of a game's release. Animal Well is a mystery I suspect I will never get the satisfaction of fully solving. Instead, I get to fumble around in its dark caves for what seems like an eternity, prodding at its curiosities and objects of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is perhaps the most enigmatic of the bunch. Every door's contents is locked behind another puzzle. Televisions are hooked up to video game consoles that contain hidden directions and clues within their low-poly video games. Every line of dialogue is an esoteric headtrip. Walls are lined with posters that obscure patterns that are keys to boxes. Written notes contain ciphers, and there are otherworldly portals that take you to elaborately constructed mazes. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is such a defiant game; it absolutely refuses to level with the player, opting instead to frequently demand that they rise to its level, a feat it is confident the player can achieve, in order to unlock its secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">I appreciate the room that these titles and others have given me this year because it feels increasingly rare. Games these days are often criticized for featuring too many tutorials or guideposts, and due to these trends, they can often feel reluctant to let go of the player's hand. Just this year, there have been countless conversations around yellow paint in level design, which is used to funnel players towards objectives and can be a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask. There's no right way to think about this design philosophy, but I do sincerely believe that the industry has erred on the side of hand holding a little too strongly, and it has flattened the experience of playing, or at least, the feelings that play can elicit. Of course, it's worth considering what mold of game I'm talking about when I suggest such a radical shift. Open-world games have a different responsibility to their players than puzzle games do, which could stand in the way of these developers bucking the trends I'm outlining. Still, the hope is that by speaking to the merits of the exemplary design in puzzle and mystery games, that more games of different genres might feel emboldened to pursue similar philosophies. I think it could work to brilliant effect, and in truth, it already has.</p><p dir="ltr">I always come back to The Legend of Zelda and its famously "hidden" bomb walls. The NES couldn't really afford the space for a different texture on these walls, making them appear like any other surface. However, they were in fact hidden across the game's world, incentivizing players to go out and discover them by any means necessary. Eventually, players discovered that by placing bombs at very select segments of walls, they could find hidden rooms and treasures. There's not a doubt in my mind that this was infuriating as all hell, but I also love that the game challenged players to be thoughtful, and in return it rewarded them with wonders beyond what they thought possible.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe that enough games--or at least a lot of the titles that take up the general mindshare and which often dominate the conversations we have about the medium-- are really challenging players all that much. That's what makes this trio of games, which all broke into the mainstream, feel like a breath of fresh air. As many titles shunt me from set piece to set piece, allowing very little in the way of exploration of experimentation, I've begun feeling like an observer more than a driving force in the games I play. The same can't be said about Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Animal Well, or Rise of the Golden Idol, games which made me feel like the best and most capable version of myself. Each of these games is distinct from the other. They occupy different genres and employ different styles, but they're united in their utter belief in the player. My hope is that games that follow, regardless of their genre, size, or developer, can take some cues from these remarkable titles and make strides to cultivate a sense of wonder and discovery again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

                <p>At first glance, Crow Country is a nostalgia piece. It pulls on the horrific sprawl of Resident Evil, populating its theme-park setting with brain twisters and monsters contorting into human shapes. It borrows from the toy aesthetic of Final Fantasy VII, its characters rendered in blocky, plastic proportions like Playmobil. Yet, it's more than just a throwback, it lays bear the haunted roots of nostalgia culture.</p><p dir="ltr">Protagonist Mara Forest visited the titular theme park as a child, but it was not a happy experience. There, a strange man bit her and she gained some terminal illness, which is slowly killing her. She has returned to make things right, find out what happened, and stop it from happening again. She returns to what was, only fleetingly, a site of childhood joy. She finds death, its shadows, its echoes, its remnants.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country's entire setting is a place of childhood play. The park is clearly designed for small children. It lacks thrilling high-rise roller coasters and is instead populated by graveyard ghoulies, thicket mazes, and fairy-tale stage shows. It's all playful and encouraging. Even the "Haunted Hilltop" section of the park is more trick-or-treat than Horror Nights. But without the bustle of life--the parents and children to animate it--the park gains an eerie quality. This is not an original observation, of course. Theme parks are a common setting throughout horror, but Crow Country begins at the park's gates and ends when Mara leaves them once again. The whole game is enveloped by this childhood environment. It is in the contrast between the toy aesthetic and its eeriness--between theme park and haunted house--that Crow Country builds its horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country departs from its influences in that it does not have fixed camera angles. Instead, each room is a miniature diorama. The angle mimics peering over a dollhouse, lifting off the roof to see inside. For a time, the world outside is distant; you only see this room, its little objects, and its traps and puzzles. This is, of course, true of most video games, where there are only so many places you can go, but Crow Country draws its lines decisively and artificially, much like its theme-park setting. Yet, the theme park is continuous--interlocked. Like any survival-horror game, it is a set of keys and locks, each contingent on the other, one door opening another. Crow Country's world is a microcosm, apparently siphoned off, but actually the wider world in miniature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137"></a><figcaption>Mara kneels in front of a collapsed young man in the opening moments of Crow Country. She says she's here to help.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Crow Country spoilers ahead.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, the theme park itself is deceptively large, intercut with hallways and dug under with hidden depths. Mara wanders through backstage rooms and offices as much as playgrounds and rollercoasters. Eventually, she descends to the park's secret mining facilities, an underground environment made of metal scaffolds and endless abysses. Much like Resident Evil's manor, Crow Country has a secret industrial heart. However, much like the theme park itself, the mine is segmented. Each section holds a "root," a large tentacle-like object made of precious metals that the park's owner, Edward Crow, has been secretly mining. As the game progresses, the theme park becomes dirtier, overwhelmed with monsters, laced with traps and obstacles. The sun sets. The park turns as dark as the abyss below.</p><p dir="ltr">That structure, from the world above to the world below, and from day to night, mimics the game's plot, in which hidden things come to light. Edward discovered the roots touring the land with his father, wriggling in the dirt by their campsite. As an adult, he began to mine them, obscuring the operation with a cover story about a mine in Brazil. But then the creatures started coming through. Edward quickly discovered the creatures are, in fact, human beings. Edward Crow's mining of the portal has distorted what goes through it. The more the portal was mined, the more it stretches out, blob-ifies, and melts the people who pass through it. They cannot speak--only reach--and their touch contaminates. The portal is to the future: a prophetic warning of disaster and the planet rendered uninhabitable. But Edward keeps mining, obscuring this truth rather than spreading it widely.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Edward has a curious reverence for the portal. He calls the creatures who come through it "guests," almost like they are visiting the theme park. One root he leaves intact, building a shrine for his childhood discovery. The rest he mines out, leaving them gaping like severed limbs. That might seem a curious contradiction, but it is mutually reinforcing. His own past is all that matters to Crow; the rest can rot.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country taps into a vein the rest of culture is also mining. The recent novel Birnam Wood concerns a billionaire secretly mining lithium underneath a New Zealand national park, an echo of Crow's extraction. Nobody would bat an eye at a reclusive millionaire having mining assets in Brazil, but a mountain of gold from a US backwater? That might be controversial. Both works call into question what violence is further unseen, when it's in countries outside of the global North.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138"></a><figcaption>In a darkened hallway, Mara takes aim at one of Crow Country's creatures.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Crow Country has parallels to Alan Moore's "Illuminations" as well, which is a short story that concerns a middle-aged man traveling back to the pier of a childhood vacation, only to be horrified when he finds himself actually traveling back to the past. The story turns nostalgic longing into pure terror: the kind of thing only a fool would actually want. Returning to the past with the knowledge you have now means returning as you are now, not as a wiser past you--an adult in child's garb.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country builds out a span between secretive economic exploitation and a personal longing for the past. Edward Crow's mission is in exact contrast to those of "the guests." They transport themselves from the future to the past to try to save it. In contrast, Edward maintains an imagined past to destroy the future. The one section of the park that is inaccessible is an unbuilt sci-fi section a la Tomorrowland. The future is unknown, far off, and those with the actual power to predict who are suffering the future's atrocities cannot be heard. Notably, Crow Country was not always called such. It used to be called Condor Country, presumably by its native inhabitants. That past is totally lost, completely overwritten, only found in Crow's own admission that the land was not always his. Nostalgia is by nature selective, often violent in what it chooses to omit.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, Crow Country is not exactly a startling work of horror. It is cute, and at times cuddly and warm like a worn VHS tape. But its treatment of nostalgia gives it hues, depths, and darknesses. That is what is so scary about it. It is that refusal to be merely cute, its desire to remember but not to commemorate, that makes it such a textured and lovely work. Any game looking to the past to make a future has a lot to learn from it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
