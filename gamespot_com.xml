                <p dir="ltr">Former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider says that during his later years at BioWare, the studio's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age</a> team and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition/">Mass Effect</a> team did not get along--nor did the team making Anthem.</p><p dir="ltr">"For a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lmqqa5tm4s2p" rel="nofollow ">Gaider said on BlueSky</a>. "Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Gaider, BioWare knew of the tension between the teams, but despite the fact that various attempts had been made to fix it (including transferring developers between teams), nothing seemed to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often," Gaider wrote. "Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a>] team. The team didn't want me there. At all."</p><p dir="ltr">Gaider said BioWare had asked him to write a "science fantasy" story, but his work was frequently rejected and declared too Dragon Age-like.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until this point, [Anthem] had been concepted as kind of a 'beer &amp; cigarettes' hard sci-fi setting (a la Aliens), and I'd been given instructions to turn it into something more science fantasy (a la Star Wars), Gaider explained. "Yet I don't think anyone told the team this. So they thought this change was <em>my</em> doing."</p><p dir="ltr">"I won't go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG," he continued. "[They] were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare-quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that."</p><p dir="ltr">The tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams combined with the friction within Gaider's Anthem team was stressful--stressful enough that Gaider tried to ensure that at the very least, he wouldn't be put in the same situation again post-Anthem.</p><p dir="ltr">"I saw the writing on the wall," he wrote. "This wasn't going to work. So I called up my boss and said that I'd stick it out and try my best, but only if there was SOMETHING waiting on the other side, where I could have more say as Creative Director. I wanted to move up. I was turned down flat, no hesitation.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, after 17 years at BioWare, Gaider walked in 2016, leaving the studio behind despite his fear of losing financial stability.</p><p dir="ltr">"After my last day, [I was] literally having a nervous breakdown, wondering what kind of idiot gives up a 'good job.' How was a writer, of all things, with no real interest in business supposed to start his own studio? It felt apocalyptic. Within a year, however, I was on my way."</p><p dir="ltr">Today, Gaider is the creative director at <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/" rel="nofollow ">Summerfall Studios</a>, an indie outfit he co-founded.</p><p dir="ltr">"We make games with character," reads the studio's website.</p><p dir="ltr">As for BioWare, the entirety of the development team is currently at work on the next entry in the Mass Effect series, which was announced in 2020 but currently has no release date.</p>

The skill system lets players choose what augments they think will work best, though Blizzard will include some build suggestions as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These upgrades cost Stadium Cash, which Blizzard says you'll earn based on how well you score in each match. There are a couple of balancing features Stadium includes to help those who might be struggling, though. Skills purchased in the first, third, and fifth rounds are free, and there's a bounty in each match--a player on the opposing team who's performing particularly well--that rewards bonus Stadium Cash if you defeat them.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Stadium's launch coincides with Season 16 and the debut of new damage character Freja. Freja won't be playable in Stadium initially, but Blizzard said future updates will add more heroes to the Stadium roster.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're keen to see more of Stadium in action, check out our hands-on preview, where we said it's the mode where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-finally-earning-the-2-in-its-name/1100-6529616/" data-ref-id="1100-6529616">Overwatch 2 finally earns its sequel status</a>, after almost two years.</p>

                <p>Mouse Work is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shovel-knight-dig/" data-ref-id="5000-501664">Shovel Knight Dig</a> developer Nitrome announced shortly after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>. It's a party game specifically built around the fact that Joy-Con 2 controllers can also be used as mice. There's just one catch: Nitrome doesn't have a Switch 2 development kit yet.</p><p>Dev kits are necessary for a game studio to release their game on a platform like Switch 2. Nintendo has reportedly been quite restrictive in distributing Switch 2 development kits prior to its launch this June, which puts indie developers like Nitrome in an awkward situation. Games that get on a new system early are often closely associated with the platform for its lifespan, which can majorly benefit indie titles.</p><p>"We recognize that there is an opportunity there if you get something new out of the gate or close to launch, and [if] you use some of the features, there's going to be a decent audience there that wants to try it," studio founder Matthew Annal told me in an interview.</p><p>In reality, it's not Nitrome's decision if that gets to happen because a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mouse-work/" data-ref-id="5000-671693">Mouse Work</a> can't cross the finish line until Nintendo gets the studio a development kit. Situations like Nitrome's serve as a reminder of just how much power Nintendo holds in what the rollout of Switch 2 and its library of games looks like.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Annal, Nitrome first became intrigued at the idea of developing a game for Switch 2 when the team saw the console's January announcement, which hinted that it'd have some form of mouse support. Annal's initial idea was to bring a classic Nitrome Flash game, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-paint/" data-ref-id="5000-17544">Mario Paint</a>-inspired <a href="https://nitrome.fandom.com/wiki/Pest_Control" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pest Control</a>, to Switch 2. Annal felt Pest Control's design was too "dated," though, and decided it'd be more creatively fulfilling to build a game for Switch 2 from the ground up. That's when Mouse Work was born.</p><p>Mouse Work's mouse-control-driven minigames range from closing pop-up ads to guiding climbers up a mountain. Annal cited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pico-park/" data-ref-id="5000-454006">Pico Park</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> as major inspirations. Mouse Work is made in the game engine Unity, and Nitrome is currently working within a development environment that allows them to use multiple mice on one desktop. As the X video below shows, they're simply strapping Joy-Cons on top of these mice to test the game's feel for now.</p><p>Outside of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, it's one of the only confirmed Switch 2 games to be completely built around the use of mouse controls and the capability of simultaneously using multiple controllers in mouse mode while playing. It's a game that feels solely made for Switch 2, which is why it's shocking to learn that Nitrome had not even contacted Nintendo for a dev kit before announcing it.</p><p>While Nitrome has released games like Shovel Knight Dig and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bomb-chicken/" data-ref-id="5000-479956">Bomb Chicken</a> for Nintendo Switch, Nitrome didn't think they'd be granted a Switch 2 dev kit if they just reached out with a cold call pitch for Mouse Work.</p><p>"We thought that if we tried to reach out, there would be no chance that they'd actually get back to us because they'd say we haven't got a project. We thought, 'Let's just get it together, get a video, and aim for just after the next Direct because, for all we know, there might be something about the mouse that's different from what we're assuming'…We thought [that] having something to show would give [Nintendo] more reason to give us a dev kit."</p><p>Annal believed there was a chance that Nintendo could have a mouse-themed title for launch and was ultimately relieved when no such games appeared in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. After three months of development without even contacting Nintendo, Nitrome unveiled Mouse Work publicly on April 7 and subsequently reached out for a dev kit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476032"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg"></figure><p>Mouse Work's trailer did not disclose that Nitrome did not yet have a Switch 2 dev kit, so it got attention like any new Switch 2 game. Unfortunately for Nitrome, Nintendo still has not yet guaranteed the studio a dev kit. Annal has heard back from Nintendo of America, but needs Nintendo of Europe to get the ball rolling so Mouse Work on Switch 2 can become a reality.</p><p>"We've made things for Nintendo Switch, so we have some Nintendo contacts. We reached out to them, but most people are [being] really silent. No one wants to get back to you all of a sudden. So maybe they're really busy or maybe they're being told: 'Don't talk to anyone who wants dev kits,'" Annal explained. "I did hear from a couple of people, but they were from the US side and their advice was 'You need to talk to the European side because you're in Europe,' so that wasn't especially helpful."</p><p>For now, that's where Mouse Work remains. It's still in active development as Nitrome continues to flesh the experience out with new minigames, colorblind-friendly features, and more. Ultimately, Nintendo must reach back out to Nitrome for Mouse Work to hit Switch 2's ever-so-valuable launch window.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476033" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476033"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg"></figure><p>Once the dev kit is in Nitrome's hands, Annal doesn't think it'll cause much of a delay in development. He hopes Nitrome will have a version of Mouse Work to submit "within a few weeks" of getting a dev kit. Annal says Mouse Work could launch as early as July if Nitrome gets dev kits in time, but admits that "it really depends on when we get dev kits."</p><p>Much of Mouse Work's appeal comes from the fact that it feels tailor-made for Switch 2, which is why it's a shock to learn that Nitrome does not have a dev kit yet. At some point, the doors for Switch 2 dev kits have to blow wide open, and the Switch 2 eShop can become as packed with indie games as the Switch's eShop currently is. It’s worth remembering that the eShop was similarly restrictive during the early days of Nintendo Switch, resulting in a few key indie titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snake-pass/" data-ref-id="5000-459128">Snake Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together!</a> really standing out.</p><p>As Nintendo Switch 2 approaches launch, Nintendo is being just as restrictive with indie games again, only allowing select ones like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deltarune/" data-ref-id="5000-576112">Deltarune</a> on the platform. The power to bring games to Switch 2 is ultimately in Nintendo's hands, even when the game in question feels as tailor-made for the platform as Mouse Work.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When you love horror games as I do, you scour places like Steam for hidden gems. I've come to find a lot of those hidden gems come from DreadXP, the offshoot publishing label of longtime horror outlet Dread Central. But even in the brand's already-strange catalog, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/white-knuckle/" data-ref-id="5000-648478">White Knuckle</a> stands out. Its scares, so far anyway, don't come in the form of monsters or malicious beings like a usual horror game would feature. Instead, the scares are induced one step at a time in a massive silo where one wrong move means falling to your death.</p><p dir="ltr">White Knuckle is a first-person wall-climbing horror game that sees you trying to stay ahead of some kind of murky sludge slowly creeping up an enormously tall silo that was built for reasons I couldn't ascertain in my preview of the game. The context of the place is clearly meant to be part of White Knuckle's allure, and players are surely already trying to piece together that story.</p><p dir="ltr">I thought I would persevere through the game's challenging platforming to see more of the story for myself, especially since, early on, the controls were hard to understand, and I wondered if they'd be an obstacle. When a game is so dependent on its controls, it's often the case that the best examples feel natural and fluid right away. White Knuckle is odd in that it feels off at first but doesn't take much longer before it comes together. It's merely the difference of minutes versus seconds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPSF1_SnPBI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPSF1_SnPBI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Swinging hand to hand, hammering in pitons, throwing rebar from a distance to give myself a clutch handhold just as the sludge beneath me begins bubbling up into my room, it all eventually clicked. Every once in a while, I'd climb high enough that the silo would close off a section beneath me, acting like a temporary checkpoint--I could fall onto it rather than plummet back to the very beginning, provided the sludge hadn't risen to blanket the floor yet.</p><p dir="ltr">With a limited inventory, I was quickly making strategic decisions. Do I take the nondescript tin can, which contains some kind of fluid that recharges my stamina--thus reinvigorating my fatigued hands some hundreds of meters above ground--or do I take the additional piton, giving myself a chance to make a risky reach a much safer one somewhere along my path?</p><p dir="ltr">Though my constrained pockets were certainly a hallmark of horror games, I was consciously searching for other classic horror elements. Its audio and setting are certainly creepy, but without a more traditional horror scenario in front of me, I was wondering just how frightening the game might be. Is it merely a horror game because the setting is vaguely unsettling?</p><p dir="ltr">But the farther I climbed, the more I realized that I needn't have searched for or expected any monsters. The act of climbing these structures had seeped into my mind as the game's horror, after all. It was an epiphany I had mid-climb during my hands-on time. Wait a minute, I thought to myself while dangling hundreds of meters above the ground, <em>this</em> is terrifying. The threat of failing a jump, of exhausting my hands and slipping to my death, or of stumbling so repeatedly that the murky goo caught up to me--it was exhilarating. The climb was the monster. It felt like Mirror's Edge by way of unending night terrors.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475929" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475929"></a><figcaption>Speedrunners will have a field day with White Knuckle, though I'll just be glad not to miss a handhold at times.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This epiphany brought the whole experience together. At that point, I was more determined than ever to understand its world, reading its strange signage and listening for its disembodied voice announcing workplace goings-on that always felt like a fraction of a clue as to what the hell this silo was for in the first place. With the stakes real and my character's vulnerability obvious, I felt each step in my stomach. I wanted to learn more of its world and I'd come to understand--if not yet master--its controls, and I finally <em>got</em> the gameplay loop. I felt I was ready to press on when the Steam Early Access game arrives later this week on April 17.</p><p dir="ltr">White Knuckle isn't much like anything else DreadXP has published before, and for a label as oddball as this one, that's really saying something. It won't be easy, and it definitely won't be for anyone who fears heights, but if you can endure its wall-climbing horrors, maybe we'll meet each other at the finish line and help each other make sense of White Knuckle's lo-fi, high-tension unreality.</p>

However, Zelda YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeltik </a>spotted two additional bonuses during a hands-on with Breath of the Wild's and Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 versions--equipment repair and bow repair.</p><p dir="ltr">The roulette didn't land on either for Zeltik during their demo, so it's unclear how the repair bonus actually works. "Bow repair" is self-explanatory in that it'll repair a bow, of course, though "equipment repair" is a little more vague. Link's other, non-bow equipment in both games includes shields and breakable weapons, but there's no indication yet as to which category that repair might apply to.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p>GoldenEye 007 is one of the most iconic and beloved games ever, but it's never gotten a proper remaster. That's not for a lack of trying, though. Stephen Kick, the head of Nightdive Studios, said in an interview that the company tried to make it happen--but Nintendo apparently shut it down.</p><p>Nightdive is known for bring back old games for modern consoles, with some of the titles under its belt including Turok, Doom 64, and Quake II, among many others.</p><p>Kick told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/we-never-give-up-remaster-kings-nightdive-on-saving-gamings-past/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that it was "a real heartbreak" for the GoldenEye remaster to fail to come together. Kick said Nightdive put "a lot of effort" into pitching the game and assembling a "dream team" to make it happen. He said the MGM/Eon side of the equation was on board, but things fell apart when it came to Nintendo.</p><p>After getting MGM/Eon to agree, "Then it was: 'OK, we're ready to go.' 'Well, did you guys get the rights from Nintendo?' 'Wait a minute, we thought you had that.' And then Nintendo was like, 'Yeah, no third party's ever going to touch any Nintendo stuff, ever,'" Kick said.</p><p>Nightdive's Larry Kuperman added that the company has a history of working with Nintendo, as Nightdive was the first company to bring an N64 game to Switch with Turok. "So that got their attention right away," Kuperman said. "But it didn't really lead to a partnership or anything," he added.</p><p>Kuperman went on to say that Nintendo has a "very successful business philosophy that's worked well for them," so he understands why Nintendo didn't want to let Nightdive make a remaster.</p><p>"It's very hard for [Nintendo] to make an exception. And I don't know whether they knew that it was going to--how should I put this politically correctly--that it was going to leave something to be desired in there. What they put out was kind of minimal," he said. "And I'm trying to be fair about it, but I don't think that they could say, 'Well, we're going to make an exception.'"</p><p>In 2023, GoldenEye 007 came to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-007-controls-on-switch-are-wildly-unintuitive/1100-6510933/" data-ref-id="1100-6510933">Nintendo Switch and Xbox.</a> It's currently available for Xbox Game Pass. On Xbox, the game includes support for 4K resolution, with smoother frame rates. Years before this, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-remaster-gameplay-leaks-but-well-never-play-it/1100-6486936/" data-ref-id="1100-6486936">new version of GoldenEye 007 for Xbox 360 leaked online</a>. It was reportedly canceled due to rights and licensing issues. The situation may be even more complicated now that Amazon MGM Studios owns the rights to James Bond, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">original producing partners Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

                <p>Studio Chaf has announced that it is shutting down its debut game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790930/Velev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Velev</a>, days after it launched into Steam Early Access on April 9.</p><p>"As some of you may have already noticed, we weren't able to reach the point we needed to continue supporting and servicing Velev," the development team said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2790930/view/574879683755115731" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Despite our best efforts, we couldn't secure the investment we needed from VCs or larger partners. With limited options, we made the decision to launch in Early Access, hoping for the best."</p><p>Chalf added that the studio understood that Velev wasn't in the best state when it launched as a paid early access title on Steam. However, it was the only viable path forward in order to continue development. Unfortunately, Chaf is stepping away from development and bringing Velev to a close.</p><p>Velev is also transitioning to a free-to-play model, with all purchases being fully refunded. While the game's server will shut down eventually, a specific date hasn't been determined yet.</p><p>Velev is a game that has both PvP MOBA arena action as well as PvE gameplay. Players assume the role of an explorer who stumbles upon a void within the Earth, stepping into a new world where technology and nature coexist in harmony.</p><p>While not the exact same situation, the disastrous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-shuts-down-days-after-disastrous-launch/1100-6519871/" data-ref-id="1100-6519871">early access launch of The Day Before</a> caused its developer Fntastic to shut down the game mere days after its launch.</p><p>Steam also recently added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-offers-notice-for-early-access-games-that-havent-been-updated-in-months/1100-6529265/" data-ref-id="1100-6529265">new notice for early access games</a>. If a game in early access hasn't been updated in several months, its Steam page will now mention that. This gives potential buyers a clear warning that a game they're about to purchase hasn't been updated or supported in a while.</p>
