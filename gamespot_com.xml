                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> creator Markus "Notch" Persson says he's hoping to start work on a new game that would serve as a "spiritual successor" to the block-based sandbox game he first created in 2009.</p><p dir="ltr">"I basically announced Minecraft 2," Persson tweeted shortly after <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow ">posting a poll</a> asking for players' opinions on the direction of his current project, which he says is "a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon-crawler."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I basically announced minecraft 2.<br>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.<br>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know…</p>  — notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"But then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia, and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash," Persson wrote in a post sharing the poll.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Minecraft fans went wild, and when asked to elaborate, Persson confirmed he was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875225803220512852" rel="nofollow ">"100% serious" about a sequel</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that maybe people actually do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again," Persson wrote. "I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite clearly being passionate about the idea, Persson was just as eager to share his fears regarding the ways a Minecraft sequel could potentially go wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it," he said. "Saying that, spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. [These are] the things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway, and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even <em>more</em> cash for?"</p><p dir="ltr">Persson added that he'd want any profit made from a potential Minecraft sequel to be "spent for good [things]," adding that despite Minecraft's popularity and success, the game has also taught him a lot about failure. "Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed," he wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Before signing off, Perrson stated that he had no intention to "sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing [with Minecraft] and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft sh*ttification about."</p><p dir="ltr">"I respect them for doing that," Persson said of Microsoft, which purchased Minecraft in 2014. "It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me."</p><p dir="ltr">In the years since the acquisition, Microsoft has expanded the franchise with spin-offs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/">Minecraft Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-dungeons/">Minecraft Dungeons</a>. As for the possibility of a sequel, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in the wake of the 2014 buyout that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-minecraft-buyout-possibility-of-mi/1100-6423159/">focused first and foremost on improving the original game</a>, rather than looking toward a sequel. In 2015, Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson said there were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/">"no discussions [happening] about Minecraft 2 at the moment,"</a> but neither Microsoft nor Mojang have ever said that a sequel was entirely off the table.</p><p>Persson hasn't yet shared any glimpses of his current work with players, so there's no telling what a Minecraft 2 might look like, though one imagines it would share its predecessor's cube-covered art style. In addition to a potential playable sequel, Minecraft fans also have a block-based blockbuster to look forward to, with A Minecraft Movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-trailer-for-a-minecraft-movie-provides-a-deeper-look-at-the-block-based-blockbuster/1100-6527875/">set to hit theaters in April</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is continuing to expand Xbox Game Pass, with new LG Smart TVs coming later this year set to support the service via Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox App on their new LG TV, no Xbox required. A select few games, around 50, will also be streamable via the new LG TVs for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who own them. Microsoft announced the ability to stream owned games in November, with titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">NBA 2K25, Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and others supporting the feature. </p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those looking to stream Xbox Game Pass titles without an actual console or PC can do so via their phone, Amazon Fire TV, or on newer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-support-coming-to-2021-samsung-smart-tvs/1100-6509215/" data-ref-id="1100-6509215">Samsung Smart TVs</a>. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> it will reveal more details about how the service will work on LG Tvs "in the coming months." It's currently unclear if support for the service will eventually come to some older LG TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Game Pass heading to LG TVs comes as part of Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This is an Xbox" marketing campaign</a>, where the company has looked to expand the idea of what it means to play on Xbox by highlighting how players can play "Xbox" on their PC, phones, or even TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a message Microsoft has been using for a while now. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">the goal was to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but that didn't necessarily mean selling more consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to allowing players to stream Xbox Game Pass titles from a variety of devices, Microsoft has continued to offer many of its first-party titles on competing platforms. Xbox's most recent big console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring</a>.</p>

                <p>Despite the fact that the second game in the Citizen Sleeper series hasn't been released yet, the creator said that he's already working on the third entry. However, it won't be what you'd expect.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/citizen-sleeper-3-tabletop-game-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>, creator Gareth Damian Martin said, "I’m done with video games. Citizen Sleeper 2 has an ending of sorts. I’m working on developing a tabletop game, which will be Citizen Sleeper 3."</p><p>Martin adds that he wants to take what he's learned from developing the two Citizen Sleeper games and apply it to something new. "The thing that drew me to making indie video games was that people are so welcoming and excited about new ideas," he explained. "I’m always wanting to propose something new and see how people react, so this will be my next step."</p><p>The series draws inspirations from tabletop RPGs and has action-economy gameplay based on rolling dice, so it's no surprise that the third entry will go back to its roots as a tabletop game.</p><p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector launches on January 31 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It will also come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-coming-to-game-pass-day-one-xbox-series-x-s-versions-confirmed/1100-6517185/" data-ref-id="1100-6517185">Xbox Game Pass on release day</a>. The game takes place one year after the events of the first game, and has an entirely new story and cast of characters.</p><p>The first Citizen Sleeper sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/citizen-sleeper/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable score of 82</a> on GameSpot's sister site, Metacritic.</p>
