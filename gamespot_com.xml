The Persona 5 skins for Overwatch 2 make the game's heroes look exactly as you expect them to, so much so that it is actually a little difficult to realize what hero is underneath the costume. There are, however, a few flourishes, such as rose petals falling from Mercy's wings and Wuyang's staff evoking Joker's Persona Arsene.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-new-support-hero-wuyang-would-fit-right-in-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/1100-6533909/" data-ref-id="1100-6533909">Wuyang is Overwatch 2's newest support hero</a> and as such doesn't have many cosmetics to choose from just yet, so it's nice that he is featured prominently as part of the crossover. Mercy, on the other hand, is one of the game's most popular characters and is often featured in crossovers, so her donning the look of Panther is a bit of a no brainer. Blizzard hasn't released the exact prices for the skins just yet, but expect them to be similar to that of previous crossovers, which usually cost around 2,800 ($28) Overwatch Coins per skin bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295"></a><figcaption>Artwork created for the Overwatch 2 x Persona 5 collab by Atlus artist Shigenori Soejima.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outside of new skins, a few of Persona 5's visual flourishes will also make their way into Overwatch 2's menus, including a new piece of key art from Atlus character artist Shigenori Soejima. A Phantom Thieves-inspired overlay will also appear when viewing the Persona 5 cosmetics in the game's shop, a first for a collab, according to Blizzard.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't keen on opening their wallets to the Phantom Thieves, Overwatch 2 collabs usually bring some freebies in the form of sprays, weapon charms, and player icons for those who complete various challenges. Overwatch 2's Persona 5 crossover will be live September 16-30.</p>

While developer Gearbox has stated that it is looking into some of the issues, CEO Randy Pitchford has taken to X to challenge assertions that Borderlands 4 is, in some way, broken.</p><p>Pitchford has published a series of posts that that claim that players have unrealistic expectations for frame rates. Specifically taking issue with players who want to run Borderlands 4 at 4K resolution on different types of hardware, Pitchford discounted those who he called "4K stubborn" and encouraged people to try the game at 1440p.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three year old hardware," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn't worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off--the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you're not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you've got a beast of a video card, you're probably fine at 4k. But if you're in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade."</p><p>Pitchford also wrote about how he believes players to have unrealistic hopes for performance from older PC hardware; he characterized many complaints as originating from people who are attempting to run the game on several-year-old PC builds. In response to a comment from a person suggesting Gearbox "build [Borderlands 4] for the most common hardware in the first place," for instance, Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote that</a> "Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers."</p><p>"Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it," he stated. "So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PCs work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features... If you're trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower's motor, you're going to be disappointed."</p><p>Alongside expressions of irritation and resistance to the complaints, Pitchford also shared recommendations for "optimizing" performance on PC, including suggestions for using DLSS and tweaking certain settings. Gearbox itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/2/596285654384682506/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a PC trouble-shooting guide on Steam to help players navigate potential issues or bugs.</p><p>Anecdotally, it appears that performance issues may occur inconsistently, vary across even minor changes in hardware, or generally be difficult to nail down. PC Gamer and Digital Foundry, for instance, have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ive-tested-borderlands-4-on-a-minimum-spec-pc-and-a-monster-rtx-5090-rig-and-it-runs-just-as-borderlands-at-launch-as-youd-expect/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> sluggish frame rates on native resolutions even on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v1ST5qMoaY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-of-the-line graphics cards</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">EA has revealed a suite of quality-of-life fixes for The Sims 4, which will release over the next eight weeks. As part of this wave of updates, Sims players can vote on which quality-of-life features and bug fixes they would like to see first.</p><p dir="ltr">First of all, a base game update is set to arrive on September 18 on PC. The update will release five days later on console. This is an earlier release date than was originally planned, which is intended to help the team correct for errors and problems across the multitude of Sims players' set-ups and configs. Additionally, modders and content creators can use the extra time to update their offerings ahead of the upcoming expansion <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-sims-4-expansion-brings-vacation-getaways-and-imaginary-friends/1100-6534497/">Adventure Awaits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In October, the team will continue to monitor the community and provide hotfixes for Adventure Awaits. Finally, another base game update will arrive in November. The update will include fixes, but will also offer new content for all Sims 4 players. EA has not released any information about what this update will feature, but has promised further information will come closer to November.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are a Sims 4 player and want to provide your input on which fixes the team should prioritize, you can log into the <a dir="ltr" href="https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/ideas/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en?ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-tab-main-wlhmjz-1=mostKudoed&amp;amp;ideas.widget.ideamessageswidget-status-main-wlhmjz-1=in_review" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">official Sims forums</a> and upvote any threads which represent an issue you are experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr">EA recently reaffirmed its commitment to continual updates for The Sims 4, saying that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/">a Sims 5 is not in the works</a>.

                <p>Rich Lambert, the boss at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, has said he hopes to make additional games beyond the popular MMO. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Lambert said he wants The Elder Scrolls Online to succeed and thrive, but diversification is important, too.</p><p>ZeniMax Online Studios was reportedly making a new game called Project Blackbird that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">sounded like a cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny</a> before it was canceled amid wider cuts at Microsoft.</p><p>"I want to make more games," Lambert said. "I'm not done yet, and the team continues to want to make more games as well. I have lots of ideas. Hopefully we'll be able to share those at some point."</p><p>He added: "I don't think you can ride one thing into forever. I mean, obviously we want ESO to be successful, we want it to be that 30-year MMO, and commit to it. But if you put all your eggs in one basket, there's issues."</p><p>Also in the interview, Lambert shared an ambitious-sounding goal for ZeniMax Online Studios, and that is to be the "most successful studio" across all of ZeniMax. "That's a big thing to say because we've got Bethesda Game Studios, we've got MachineGames, and id--the list goes on. But I want us to be that group that everybody looks at, like we do with [Bethesda Game Studios]," he said.</p><p>Lambert said the track record of Bethesda Game Studios is enviable and has a "massive legacy." Lambert said, "That's what I want us to do."</p><p>The Elder Scrolls Online launched in 2014 for PC before expanding to PS4 and Xbox One in 2015 and then Xbox Series X|S and PS5 in 2021. It debuted as a subscription-based game before shifting to a free-to-play model, and it has <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1849086170770153940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached more than 25 million players.</a></p><p>It's been running for more than 10 years, but it's not the longest-running MMO. Blizzard's genre-defining World of Warcraft has been online since 2004, and it's been subscription-based the whole time. The Lord of the Rings Online, meanwhile, has been up and running since 2007. EverQuest, then, has been running for longer than both World of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p><p>In addition to ongoing support for The Elder Scrolls Online, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but there is no word yet on when it could be released.</p>

                <p>Sony has spoken once again about exactly how it is utilizing AI in video game development, which it says allows it to accelerate and streaming the process. The company has already utilized some AI use with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">Spider-Man 2</a> and even tested some models <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">using Horizon Zero Dawn's Aloy</a>. However, Sony believes AI should support creativity, not replace it, according to its own mission statement about its own AI tool called Enterprise LLM, which helps employees across the company use AI safely.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2025 corporate report</a>, since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams have started using this system. Employees are using it not just for chat or writing help, but also by connecting it directly to their daily work tools. So far, Sony has tested more than 300 AI projects, with over 50 now part of regular work routines.</p><p>To make sure AI is used safely, Sony is also working closely with teams that focus on legal issues, privacy, and ethics. In the process, clearer rules are being created for how AI should be used, especially to avoid problems like copying music or other content without permission. The company is also using AI to help protect creators' work by building systems that can detect if something has been stolen or used without approval. At the same time, Sony is using AI to make older movies sound better and to improve picture quality on the PS5 with new upscaling tech.</p><p>Some in the gaming industry agree that changes like these are needed. Masahiro Sakurai, the famous game developer known for Kirby and Super Smash Bros., said big games take too much time and effort to make and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">that the current way of doing things can't last</a>. He believes AI could help teams work faster and smarter, especially in large game studios. Sakurai said only the studios that adapt to AI will be able to keep up in the future.</p><p>AI in gaming is still a hot topic. Some companies, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">Activision, are already using AI tools during game development</a>, but say they don't use AI to replace creative work <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-embraces-ai-but-not-to-replace-humans/1100-6534113/" data-ref-id="1100-6534113">as everything is still "human-created and touched."</a></p><p>Others are more cautious and have genuine concerns. Last year, a deal between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/" data-ref-id="1100-6520224">SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, and an AI voice company called Replica Studios caused controversy</a>. This past May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a group of video game companies made important changes to their offer in an effort to end the actors' strike led by SAG-AFTRA</a>. Since the beginning of the strike, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">which finally ended in June</a>, SAG-AFTRA had pushed for stronger protections around how these digital replicas are used and how actors are paid for them.</p><p>Samantha Beart, who played Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, has criticized the use of AI in the entertainment industry for short-term profit, warning that it could lead to long-term damage. Beart emphasized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-actor-says-ai-could-destroy-the-reputation-of-game-companies/1100-6530278/" data-ref-id="1100-6530278">that actors won't back down in the fight against AI</a>, as accepting it could mean giving up their careers. She added that while the industry is filled with passionate, creative people, it's being influenced by investors who don't play games and are only focused on quick returns.</p><p>Even Microsoft, which had reaffirmed its $80 billion investment in artificial intelligence for 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">openly acknowledged that AI advancements will lead to job losses</a>--a long-anticipated consequence in certain sectors.</p>
