                <p>David Anthony Burke, who began his music career as D4vd after uploading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> montages to YouTube with his own original songs in 2021, has reportedly been identified as a suspect in the murder of Celeste Rivas.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/11/18/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas-death/#continued" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, law enforcement said that despite there being no official paperwork classifying Burke as a suspect yet, "investigators are looking at [him] as a suspect." Those same investigators reportedly claimed they're viewing Rivas' death as a homicide while waiting on toxicology results from the medical examiner's office.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas/3806178/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Los Angeles report</a> corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring. According to law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decomposed-body-found-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-los-angeles-rcna230159" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who spoke to NBC News</a>, Rivas' remains were not intact when discovered.</p><p>Sources told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/singer-d4vd-considered-suspect-investigation-teen-found-dead/story?id=126591951" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that, although the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, investigators have contacted multiple people they believe were involved with the case in some way. This includes Burke.</p><p>Celeste Rivas disappeared in the Lake Elsinore area last year. She was reportedly last seen on April 5, 2024, in the western Riverside County community in Southern California. Family members said she knew Burke, and her brother, Matthew, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/body-of-teen-girl-found-in-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-what-we-know/3826873/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told NBCLA</a> that she was on her way to see a movie with him the day she disappeared.</p><p>Rivas' body was found in the front trunk of a Tesla parked in an LA tow yard on September 8. Workers noticed a foul odor coming from the vehicle, which was registered to Burke, and notified nearby authorities. Officers came through and discovered the remains in a bag, later to be identified via forensics as the missing teenager.</p><p>Burke was a rising star in the alternative R&amp;B scene, but he started as a gamer. He uploaded various Fortnite montages and anime compilations to YouTube under a channel called "ant" in 2021, but his videos kept getting copyright strikes because of his music choices. To combat this, he started creating his own songs to pair with his videos, which eventually led to his D4vd persona, which he claimed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbF7opVBnHQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Zach Sang Show interview</a> was both for SEO and the four cinematic universes (and the characters) he was building.</p><p>He quickly found popularity on TikTok and eventually signed a record deal with Interscope Records' Darkroom label. He'd then produce a single for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-calls-out-netflix-for-disrespectful-ai-made-arcane-season-2-poster/1100-6527972/" data-ref-id="1100-6527972">Arcane Season 2</a>, record the official Fortnite anthem "Locked &amp; Loaded," perform at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards in December 2024</a>, and go on a world tour in August 2025. The remaining tour dates have been canceled following Rivas' death.</p><p>According to ABC News, investigators believe that the medical examiner's office will determine the official cause of death soon. Sources said this will be a vital step in making an arrest and finalizing the charges.</p>

                <p>Epic Games is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teaming up with Unity </a>to support the popular game engine within Fortnite. Eventually, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, this partnership will allow "all Unity games" to be published within Fortnite. That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite.</p><p>"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines," <a href="https://x.com/unrealengine/status/1991074004963057977" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sweeney said</a> Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference.</p><p>This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks</a>, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite.</p><p>It's been a common theory among Fortnite players that Epic will eventually incorporate as many of its other games into Fortnite as it can--and this Unity news will surely fuel rumors about Fall Guys becoming a proper Fortnite mode. While most Epic titles run on Unreal Engine, as you'd expect since that's Epic's own engine, Fall Guys is a rare exception that runs on Unity. Epic has allowed folks who use the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to make their own Fall Guys islands in Fortnite since August 2024, and so it wouldn't be all that surprising if Epic ended up adding the proper full Fall Guys game into Fortnite as part of this partnership with Unity.</p><p>This deal is still fresh, though, and it'll be a bit before we learn many specific details--Epic promises to deliver more info next year.</p>

                <p>Veteran RPG developer and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain argues that modern games have forgotten some lessons of history--a point he made in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>--you can watch the full video below--responding to a viewer's question about whether older titles contain any supposed lost wisdom. Cain's answer--"Yes, there is. Good question." Looking back at his own early years in the industry, he describes an era with only programmers and some artists, but no narrative designers, and far fewer competing priorities. In contrast, he says today's games "try to be everything to everyone."</p><p>In about 13 minutes, Cain explains how he attributes the sharp focus of early games to the era's severe technical limitations and fragmented hardware landscape. "Games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles," he recalled, with no shared standards to ease development. Teams were small and multitasking was essential--programmers often acted as artists and sound designers, reverse-engineering undocumented hardware to make their games function.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YEF1Ankos0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"These games were really focused, because they had to be," he explained.</p><p>The first major lesson he believes modern developers should reclaim is the importance of efficiency. With the tiny memory budgets and slow processors of the 1980s, Cain says, "you write efficient code or your game doesn't work on the Atari console." Designers were equally constrained: They couldn't stack crafting systems, puzzles, companion mechanics, and sprawling narratives on top of each other. Instead, they had to choose a single segment of gameplay and perfect it.</p><p>"The idea that you could have a core game loop that was a huge variety of actions just did not exist," Cain added, noting that a game like Gauntlet had to nail its narrow focus on dungeon-clearing because that was the entire experience.</p><p>Cain warns that today's games risk "becoming indulgent" by adding features that "dilute the game" rather than improve it. To illustrate, he compares 1980s game design to a high-end restaurant where a chef prepares a superb dish from a few exceptional ingredients, while modern blockbuster games resemble buffets that prioritize variety over quality. His advice for developers--especially those in small indie teams--is straightforward: simplify.</p><p>"You need to be simple. You need to stay focused, and whatever you do has to be extremely well executed. And then you'll be like that fancy restaurant ... that meal was delicious."</p><p>People in the comments, though, were mixed on this observation. Games like Fallout 4 were brought up, and how that has crafting, companion quests, community building, and is a fan-favorite out of the series. Conversely, one commenter in their early 20s went back to play the original Diablo and found it kept them engaged, with practically none of the "modern tactics" that they were used to.</p>

Voting is open until December 10, so no one needs to rush to vote, Keighley reminded people.</p><p>"I'll keep you updated as we continue to improve performance. Thank you--from all of us--for your passion, patience, and support for TGA," he said.</p><p>Fan-voting makes up 10% of the vote for each category at The Game Awards, with the other 90% coming down to The Game Awards jury.
