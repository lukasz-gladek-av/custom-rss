                <p>Death Stranding was a fairly lengthy game, and if you're struggling to find time to play it before the sequel launches, then you can check out a recap video from Sony that condenses the entire story into an easily digestible six minutes.</p><p>All the important bits are covered here, including the exposition revealing how the worlds of the living and the dead have been mixed together in Death Stranding, the new status quo of a world scarred by the deadly Timefall phenomenon, and Sam Porter Bridges being entrusted with the job of reconnecting America's surviving cities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-58vDF0sw2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-58vDF0sw2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With its release date of June 26 getting closer, Sony has been ramping up marketing for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-set-for-june-8/1100-6531942/">The game had a "premiere" earlier this month</a>, and several other Death Stranding 2 events are taking place in cities like Sydney, Paris, and Seoul. Set one year after the events of Death Stranding, Death Stranding 2 sees the return of Sam Porter Bridges and other popular characters like Fragile--but not that fragile--Higgs, and Heartman.</p><p>The world that players will explore will be more dangerous than ever, as in addition to sneaking his way through enemy camps or areas inhabited by Beached Entities, Bridges will also have to deal with natural disasters and new mechanized enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-explosion-watch-the-opening-cutscene-of-death-stranding-2/1100-6532294/">You can also check out the opening act of the game</a>, which was shown off at the Death Stranding 2 premiere.</p>

      </div>
<p>EA never confirmed a June announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>--only that the game would be revealed sometime this summer. Many assumed a reveal would happen in June alongside the video game industry's numerous other events, but it's unclear if June is when the unveiling will be.</p><p>The official last day of summer in the northern hemisphere is September 22, but no one is expecting EA to wait that long to reveal Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">Lots of gameplay footage and details about Battlefield 6</a> have emerged from Battlefield Labs testing program, but everything seen so far is a work-in-progress and non-final. The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>. That remains to be seen, however, and the company has said it's keen to avoid bringing the game to market too soon to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">help avoid having another Battlefield 2042 situation on its hands.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for the Battlefield Labs testing program</a> for a chance to try the game early. EA has said it's planning to expand the tests to more users over time, so if you didn't get in already, you might still have a chance for a future test.</p>

But today, it's getting another overhaul with Vibrant Visuals, the new cosmetic refresh for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Vibrant Visuals will eventually roll out for Minecraft: Java Edition in the future. In the meantime, the newest update, Chase the Skies, is going live today on all platforms. </p><p>Chase the Skies allows players to find a dried ghast in the Nether and revive it by placing it in water. When the ghast is restored, it can be nurtured and cared for until it becomes a happy ghast. At that point, players can ride their happy ghasts into the Overworld skies and go exploring, as seen in the trailer below. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zPWdMDZWM4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of the Chase the Skies update, there's a new Locator bar that can help players find their friends in multiplayer. Amos Roddy has also composed six new music tracks--Lilypad, Below and Above, O's Piano, Broken Clocks, Fireflies, and a new version of Tears. These tracks will play in every Overworld biome, but the only way players can get Tears is if it's "looted by a ghast after a non-conventional defeat."</p><p>Players will also be given the ability to craft their own saddles, which means they never have to go searching for pre-made saddles again. </p><p>In other Minecraft news, the game recently unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-and-mlb-team-up-for-baseball-themed-fan-caves/1100-6532003/" data-ref-id="1100-6532003">its baseball-themed fan caves</a> in partnership with Major League Baseball. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie</a>--one of this year's biggest hits with just over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-is-the-biggest-hollywood-movie-of-the-year-with-over-800-million/1100-6531157/" data-ref-id="1100-6531157">$800 million worldwide</a>--is slated to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-a-minecraft-movie-comes-to-max/1100-6532435/" data-ref-id="1100-6532435">its streaming debut on Max</a> on June 20, followed by its HBO premiere on June 21.</p>

                <p>The cast of Critical Role has been linked to Dungeons &amp; Dragons from the very beginning of the hit streaming series. Now, two Dungeons &amp; Dragons veterans are joining Critical Role's publishing house, Darrington Press, to work on new game concepts and potentially on additions to the company's recently released Daggerheart game.</p><p>Darrington Press <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the announcement</a> that Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford--two of the key designers behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition--have signed on as Creative Director and Game Director, respectively. Perkins was at D&amp;D parent company Wizards of the Coast for 28 years, while Crawford had an 18-year run there.</p><p>"Storytelling has always been at the heart of everything I do, and joining Darrington Press feels a bit like coming home," said Perkins in a statement. "I've loved being a part of the extended Critical Role family as a regular guest over the years and I'm beyond excited to help create new worlds full of adventure."</p><p>"I've always believed that great games invite everyone to the table, and that’s exactly what excites me about joining Darrington Press," added Crawford. "This team is passionate, wildly creative, and committed to building welcoming, connected, amazing story-driven experiences--I can't wait to expand on what Critical Role has already created to develop some really fun and unique games."</p><p>Critical Role began in 2015 when a group of voice actors began livestreaming their Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. The series proved to be so popular that Critical Role has expanded into its own standalone media empire, with The Legend of Vox Machina animated series on Prime Video and a second series, Mighty Nein, coming in the future. Wizards of the Coast has also released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-reveals-new-critical-role-book-call-of-the-netherdeep/1100-6496983/" data-ref-id="1100-6496983">official Critical Role/Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign books</a>. In the spirit of that collaboration, the official D&amp;D social media accounts congratulated Crawford and Perkins for their new jobs.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zw55qqojhklbydnc66gzg2bt/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrqh6lyth22l" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihn6yfl4g65h7fxuhuk3daovge5ajywe4glkeslftl6e3iq5nj454" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Now that the kobold is out of the bag... Congratulations to Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins joining Darrington Press! Their creativity helped shape D&amp;D as we know it today and the team they nurtured continues to shape its future. We look forward to playing their next adventure.</p>  — Dungeons &amp; Dragons (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zw55qqojhklbydnc66gzg2bt?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@dndbeyond.com</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zw55qqojhklbydnc66gzg2bt/post/3lrqh6lyth22l?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">June 16, 2025 at 9:57 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Late last year, the Critical Role team hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-may-expand-into-video-games/1100-6528190/" data-ref-id="1100-6528190">it may make a video game in the future</a>. Darrington Press was launched in 2020 to expand Critical Role's reach in the tabletop RPG realm.</p>

                <p>Amazon Prime subscribers can grab several more great games right now as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/">Prime Gaming program</a>. In the build-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-amazon-prime-day-2025-sale/1100-6532476/">Prime Day 2025</a>--which starts on July 8 and runs through July 11--six more games are being added and they'll all be available to download starting at <strong>9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on June 17</strong>. As usual, these games will be yours to keep once you claim them, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> right now to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it currently.</p><h2>Available now</h2><ul><li>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 2 (GOG)</li><li>Saints Row 4: Re-Elected (GOG)</li><li>Toem (GOG)</li><li>Star Wars: Rebellion (GOG)</li></ul><p>As for the games, there's a fun selection of titles that'll appeal to nostalgic gamers. Tomb Raider I-III Starring Lara Croft is a big highlight here, as you're getting a trilogy of classic games starring the intrepid explorer. Each one has also been graphically updated, but you can switch back to the classic blocky look of those games if you want to play them in their original state. On top of the three games, you're also getting all of the DLC that was released for them.</p><p>Fans of crime and open-world adventures can also claim two Saints Row games. Saints Row 2 helped define the identity of the series as an over-the-top sandbox to cause chaos in, and Saints Row 4 dialed the absurdity up to 11 with a tale of Oval Office politics and an alien invasion. Strategy fans can grab Star Wars: Rebellion and see if they have what it takes to dominate the galaxy as either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. For the fantasy fans out there, Dungeon of the Endless is a fun combo of roguelike gameplay and dungeon-defense ideas.</p><p>Lastly, Toem is a superb indie adventure full of beautiful art, quirky characters, and gameplay that revolves around photography. These bonus games join the other titles that are currently available through Prime Gaming, as you can also pick up Mordheim: City of the Damned, The Abandoned Planet, Station to Station, and Death Squared right now. Later in the month, more games like Dark Envoy and Thief: Deadly Shadows will also be added.</p>
