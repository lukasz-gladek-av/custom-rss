                <p>To commemorate the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, the Australian PlayStation team has built what they claim to be the biggest memory card ever made in Australia.</p><p>This is the country's largest memory card, but not in the traditional memory-space manner. Instead, the Australian PlayStation team erected a physical memory card that stands six meters tall, or about 20 feet tall. That's about a <a href="https://colinmagazine.com/blogs/news/playstation-celebrates-30-years-in-australia-with-a-giant-memory-card-at-sydney-s-harbour?srsltid=AfmBOoqYvWflHKjJsY-5iguyBziBOL2nzpXjkTheP45Wvyh2mzEqafZv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">100-times-scale recreation</a> of an actual PS One memory card.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Trophy unlocked: Build Australia's BIGGEST Memory Card 🏆 Thanks to everyone who came down to celebrate PlayStation Australia's 30th Anniversary.

  </div><p>The card was built at Sydney's Overseas Passenger Terminal in The Rocks, and it's truly a sight to behold with the iconic Sydney Opera House in the background.</p><p>PlayStation Australia created the memory card for a free event this past weekend on Saturday, November 15, where attendees could take part in an Astro Bot speedrunning tournament and receive special 30th-anniversary giveaways.</p><p>The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, but didn't come to other markets--including Australia, the US, and Europe--in 1995.</p><p>As for the PS5, Sony's newest PlayStation console has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">sold more than 84 million units</a>, meaning it's basically even with the PS4 over a similar period of time.</p>

                <p>The delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 to November 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-delays-gta-6-and-the-internet-responds-exactly-as-youd-expect/1100-6536039/" data-ref-id="1100-6536039">disappointed the general public</a>, but Rockstar's release date shuffling also has a significant impact on competing game development studios.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=Yt0DiC7VSgKYga6x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> about a variety of industry hot topics, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani spoke about how GTA 6's delay affects his studio's planning and work on Helldivers 2.</p><p>"It gives us a stay of execution," Jorjani said, adding: "Us and everyone else."</p><p>Jorjani described the release of GTA 6 as an event that will "blot out the sun in a way unimaginable for everyone else." Rockstar's game releasing six months later than previously announced should give Arrowhead "another six months of uninterrupted work without GTA looming over us." And while Arrowhead tries to plan its content without considering other releases, Jorjani admitted that "GTA has obviously been very hard to avoid."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVTlQR__ZU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="584">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AyVTlQR__ZU?start=584" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The ominous shadow of GTA 6 is on the minds of everyone working in the games industry, with one veteran Saints Row developer recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-can-compete-with-gta-says-saints-row-dev/1100-6536051/" data-ref-id="1100-6536051">proclaiming that Rockstar is "impossible" to compete with</a>.</p><p>With the release date of GTA 6 shifting multiple times, studios have had to adjust their own plans to avoid competing with Rockstar's blockbuster launch. Even other prolific game developers like <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-everyone-would-move-out-of-the-way-of-gta-6-but-death-stranding-2-is-95-percent-complete-and-its-release-date-was-decided-a-long-time-ago/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima acknowledged</a> that "everyone would move out of the way" of GTA 6.</p><p>It's easy to imagine other prolific studios sharing Arrowhead's general strategy of not taking other competing releases into account, but GTA 6 changes the calculus. It's expected to have an earth-shattering launch, although at least one analyst predicts that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">won't be enough to save a struggling games industry</a>.</p><p>All eyes remain fixed on Rockstar, which may be on its way toward a contentious legal battle after the company dismissed more than 30 employees, with the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain accusing the studio of union-busting. Since then, over 200 current Rockstar workers have signed letters <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">demanding their former colleagues be reinstated</a>.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil's next entry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, arrives next year, but it's very different from its original idea. While it'll have the trademark horror and aesthetics, Requiem was originally designed as an online open-world multiplayer game before Capcom decided to return it to a single-player format. However, not everything was completely reformatted from the ground up.</p><p>"There are some remaining elements, but we can't disclose what [they are]," producer Masato Kumazawa told <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>, explaining that while the multiplayer project was shaping up to be a good game, it wasn't scary enough.</p><p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," he continued. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play, but we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they probably wouldn't enjoy it as much."</p><p>Requiem's development has spanned six years, including its time as a multiplayer project.</p><p>Kumazawa stated that what fans want most from Resident Evil is "survival-horror and being scared," calling fear "the number-one thing that fans want." Because of that, he said the team "couldn't just slap on new skins and new characters" and give players the same experience. Instead, they wanted to focus on delivering something that feels fresh while still fitting the expectations of the franchise.</p><p>The story introduces the new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, who begins her journey overwhelmed and in immediate danger. Director Koshi Nakanishi said this contrast is intentional, explaining that Grace starts "way over her head in danger," and described her evolution as a dramatic rise in strength. He even goes as far as to call it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-may-be-the-most-extreme-in-the-series-says-director/1100-6534329/" data-ref-id="1100-6534329">the most extreme gap</a>" between helplessness and power in the series.</p><p>Nakanishi also spoke about internal playtests, saying the team feels the game delivers "an incredible rollercoaster." He noted that players will experience a strong "curve of tension to release," with the two feelings "so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible." This design approach, he said, reflects the team's goal of making Grace's development feel meaningful while keeping the game rooted in the series' survival-horror style.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2025, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>
