                <p>At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/" data-ref-id="5000-706357">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it.</p><p>The game is in early development and still a long way off (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">but reportedly due before 2030</a>), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_">Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_platforms">Fate of the Old Republic platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_preorders">Fate of the Old Republic preorders</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_story__setting__and_characters">Fate of the Old Republic story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Hudson_s_history">Hudson's history</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_many_Star_Wars_games">One of many Star Wars games</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game.</p><p>Amid speculation that Fate of the Old Republic may not release until 2030, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">Hudson assured fans that won't be the case.</a> "Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" rel="nofollow ">Hudson wrote online</a>. "Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!"</p><h2 id="Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_"><strong>Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</strong></h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Arcanaut Studios, a team based in Edmonton with another office in Kelowna, British Columbia. The studio said its "mission is to create magical, interactive storytelling by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools in a safe and rewarding environment."</p><p>The studio said one of its goals is to "push the boundaries of what is possible," and that the team does not "fear failure."</p><p>"We are doers. We're not passengers. We are drivers,"<a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> the developer's website says</a>.</p><p>Hudson is the CEO and game director at Arcanaut, and his management team includes Chris Bain as CFO, Cordy Rierson as COO, and Ryan Hoyle as CTO. The developer's website states that people who worked at Microsoft, Epic, Remedy, The Coalition, and ZeniMax make up the current team.</p><p>As mentioned, Arcanaut was only just founded in July 2025, so it's a very new studio, and the developer said the game is in "early development." The developer is collaborating with the Star Wars rights-owner, Lucasfilm, on the project.</p><h2 id="Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was released at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. The video is more of a mood piece, taking players to somewhere far, far away, and raising more questions than it answers.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="626469893" data-promo-id="0"

id="Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_story__setting__and_characters">Fate of the Old Republic story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a single-player narrative-driven action RPG and a spiritual successor to BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Details are scant on the story and characters, but Arcanaut said its aim is to make an "epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness."</p><p>You will play as a Force user "on a journey through a galaxy on the edge of rebirth." The developer also claims that "every decision deepens" the player's journey "toward light or darkness."</p><p dir="ltr">"With Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, we're telling a completely new and different story with everything we've learned since--crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark. It's a dream come true to once again collaborate with Lucasfilm Games," Hudson said.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney Games Group boss Jay Ong added, "Their vision for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is exactly the kind of ambitious, high-quality experience we want to deliver for our players."</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with StarWars.com</a>, Hudson said, "Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p><h2 id="Hudson_s_history">Hudson's history</h2><p>Casey Hudson is a gaming veteran. He joined BioWare in 1998 and worked there for more than 16 years. He is best known for directing 2003's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and 2007's Mass Effect. He also directed Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. In 2015, Hudson joined Xbox to work on the "mixed reality" team, but he left after two years to re-join BioWare. In his second stint at BioWare, Hudson worked on Anthem and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, before leaving again in 2021 to start a new studio, Humanoid Origin, which was making a AAA sci-fi game. The studio closed in November 2024, due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/" data-ref-id="1100-6528039">"unexpected shortfall of funding."</a></p><h2 id="One_of_many_Star_Wars_games"><strong>One of many Star Wars games</strong></h2><p>Long gone are the days when Electronic Arts had the exclusive license for Star Wars games on console/PC. These days, Disney and Lucasfilm are partnered with numerous different game studios on a variety of different projects. In addition to Fate of the Old Republic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/#1" data-ref-id="2900-3917">some of the other upcoming Star Wars games</a> include a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars Eclipse, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a new game from Uncharted boss Amy Henning, among others.</p>
