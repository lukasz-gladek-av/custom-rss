                <p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-stomps-out-more-bugs-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6535403/" data-ref-id="1100-6535403">released a patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and now the developer has already dropped a new beta patch that's currently in the works. For now, this update appears to be even smaller than the last patch, with a focus on localization and control issues.</p><p>One of the most notable improvements is that rumble features have now been implemented. The devs also note that they are using a new script with an updated Chinese translation, which will be further refined "based on player feedback." The previous Chinese translation was wildly unpopular and led to the game getting review-bombed. </p><p>Most of the other fixes in this beta patch are fairly minor quality-of-life improvements. The update from earlier this week had more compelling features, including DualSense Edge support. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but fans who need additional help making their way through the game may be better served by checking out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">Silksong mods</a> that make it easier.</p><p>The beta patch 1.0.28954 is currently available to Silksong players through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. But it's not automatically added to your game. If you want to opt into the beta patch, you need to follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Right-click the game in your library</li><li>Select Properties</li><li>Go to the Betas tab</li><li>Select the current beta branch option</li><li>Download the new update</li></ol><p>Team Cherry hasn't disclosed its sales figures for Silksong yet, but one analyst suggests that the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">surpassed 4.2 million in sales</a> across consoles and PC.

This is a basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback.</li><li>Various localization fixes implemented across all languages.</li><li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support.

                <p>Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield has said he has "quite a few ideas" for what he wants to make next, and one of them is Dead Space 4.

The deal has not gone through yet and isn't expected to until 2026, so it will be some time before anything happens most likely. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-may-sell-bioware-and-dice-or-close-other-studios-says-analyst/1100-6535312/" data-ref-id="1100-6535312">BioWare is also said to be on the chopping block.</a></p><p>After leaving EA, Schofield joined Activision where he worked on a series of Call of Duty games at Sledgehammer Games.

                <p>When Ubisoft launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-crew-2/" data-ref-id="5000-464876">The Crew 2</a> in 2018, there weren't any options to bring this online racing game offline. Now, seven years later, The Crew 2 has finally received its much-requested offline mode.</p><p>Starting today, PC players can download an update from Ubisoft and enjoy The Crew 2 without an internet connection with Hybrid Mode. The console update for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will be released later today.</p><p>Players now have the option of picking either online or offline when starting up the game. If players aren't connected to the internet, then The Crew 2 will automatically switch to offline. Ubisoft notes that saves for the two modes are completely separate, and progress made offline will not carry over to online. However, players can export a copy of their online save to their computer or console for the offline mode.</p><p>The exported saves will include the Season Pass content, vehicles, and rewards as long as players claim them before they export their online save. However, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR/the-crew-2-hybrid-mode-is-now-available" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a handful of features</a> that won't carry over to offline mode:</p><ul><li>Crew Credits purchases (vehicle bundles, vanity items) and the Far &amp; Beyond shop in all 4 Hubs.</li><li>LIVE Summits.</li><li>All multiplayer content, including PvP, Crews, crew features, news feed, leaderboards, ghosts, and statistics menus. Only your own best times will be recorded per race.</li><li>UGC features, including the Race Creator and Livery Editor. Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</li><li>Some Hobbies and Achievements (Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Ubisoft Connect) that require online-only actions.</li></ul><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/" data-ref-id="1100-6519967">The Crew was delisted</a> without giving players an offline mode, effectively making the game unplayable. A few players even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-facing-lawsuit-after-the-crew-was-removed-from-platforms/1100-6527713/" data-ref-id="1100-6527713">filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft</a> over its removal. To appease its angry fans, Ubisoft promised that both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-the-crew-was-rendered-unplayable-its-sequels-will-be-preserved/1100-6526400/" data-ref-id="1100-6526400">The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest would get offline modes</a>. While the former has now received it, there isn't currently a date for the latter to get an offline mode of its own.</p><p>Earlier this year, a fan-made recreation of the first game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-coming-back-online-this-month-thanks-to-fan-made-mod/1100-6534438/" data-ref-id="1100-6534438">The Crew Unlimited</a> went online.</p>

                <p>Glen Schofield, a former Call of Duty boss at Sledgehammer Games, has said he is "immensely" worried about the future of the series under Microsoft. He also stated that the quality of most Call of Duty releases since he left has fallen.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-glen-schofields-plan-to-save-the-games-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Schofield said of Microsoft's ownership of Call of Duty, "I worry about it immensely, I really do. Because what's happening here is a war."</p><p>"Unfortunately, once you're assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits," he added.</p><p>Schofield also said he imagines that Activision has eliminated the bonus program paid to Call of Duty developers based on the success of a game, and that might negatively impact the company's ability to attract and retain top talent.</p><p>Also in the interview, Schofield said that the Call of Duty series has sunk below its previous highs, creatively at least, since he left in February 2018 after Call of Duty: WWII. "I hate doing this, but since I left Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, the last one [Sledgehammer's Modern Warfare 3 in 2023] was a 50. They still sell well," he said.</p><p>"They just aren't as good. They aren't the same. Treyarch's still really good but you know … I got lucky," he added.</p><p>Finally, Schofield said he has a theory as to why the Call of Duty series has remained an annual franchise, and it's all about money. "First of all if they go to not every year, they lose a billion dollars every year, so that's why Call of Duty never did that," he said.</p><p>It was recently reported that Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">missed out on $300 million in revenue from putting Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass</a>. The subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">recently approached $5 billion in annual for the first time ever.</a> The next entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Black Ops 7</a>, launches this November and will be on Game Pass.</p>
