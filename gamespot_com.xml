                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> has 12 side stories to discover. These are anomalies that occur in the world as a result of Mio and Zoe entering the same simulation. Razer tries to steal unfinished stories and ideas from the girls, and as such, there are some very weird occurrences going on.</p><p>Finding and experiencing side stories is a vital part of your Split Fiction experience, and you'll even get an achievement if you manage to find them all. They're split up by level, so we've detailed where they are and what happens during them. Almost all of them are easy to find, so we won't focus too much on location beyond which level they're in. If they're trickier to find, we'll provide more information on where they are.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Legend_of_the_Sandfish">The Legend of the Sandfish</a></li><li><a href="#Farmlife">Farmlife</a></li><li><a href="#Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</a><ul><li><a href="#Train_Heist">Train Heist</a></li><li><a href="#Gameshow">Gameshow</a></li><li><a href="#Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</a><ul><li><a href="#Kites">Kites</a></li><li><a href="#Moon_Market">Moon Market</a></li><li><a href="#Notebook">Notebook</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</a><ul><li><a href="#Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</a></li><li><a href="#Space_Escape">Space Escape</a></li><li><a href="#Birthday_Cake">Birthday Cake</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454765"></a><figcaption>Mountain Hike side story location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</h2><h3 id="The_Legend_of_the_Sandfish">The Legend of the Sandfish</h3><p>The Legend of the Sandfish sees Mio and Zoe enter a sand-filled world where they have to dodge, dash, and work together to escape the sandfish. You'll need to think about timing and plan your routes, and at one point, you'll even find yourself on the back of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>.</p><h3 id="Farmlife">Farmlife</h3><p>One of the funniest side stories in the game, Farmlife sees Mio and Zoe transform into pigs. Cute, right? Wrong! Eventually, Mio and Zoe will become sausages. No happy ending for pigs in this story.</p><h3 id="Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</h3><p>This is one of the trickier side stories to locate. When you find an area that you'll need to interact with some portable toilets, pause. Mio will need to enter the toilet, and Zoe needs to use her grab skill to pick it up and throw it at the ladder hanging from the roof to the left. This will drop the ladder down, revealing the path to the side story. It can also be easy to miss as it doesn't have the audio cue that other side stories have. When you do find it, it's totally worth it. Mio and Zoe will spend some time traversing a mountain, trying to dodge the footsteps and wrath of giants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766"></a><figcaption>Exploding Star side story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><h3 id="Train_Heist">Train Heist</h3><p>Train Heist is less of a heist and more of a chase, with Mio and Zoe returning to some side-scrolling action, fighting The Conductor, a large orb-like boss who isn't super happy about them being there.</p><h3 id="Gameshow">Gameshow</h3><p>This was one of the tricker side stories we experienced, as you're at the mercy of a deranged robot gameshow host who insists on creating entertainment out of forcing Mio and Zoe to handle ticking bombs. Each bomb can only remain in your hands for a few seconds before you need to pass it to your partner. The arena gets more complex each time, with fire, electricity, and disappearing platforms adding additional danger.</p><h3 id="Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</h3><p>During this side story, Mio and Zoe find themselves staring into the sun, quite literally. The sun is dying, and as it does it sends lethal waves of light through the world. You'll need to find areas to hide behind. A huge tip for the end of the story is Mio and Zoe should use one shield to cover them both, and alternate between whose shield to use. If you try to complete this side story just using your own shield to protect yourself, you'll never escape the collapse of the sun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764"></a><figcaption>Kites Side Story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><h3 id="Kites">Kites</h3><p>This side story is a race between Mio and Zoe as they traverse the skies via tunnels, kites, and wind sockets. Who will win? It can be tricky to aim for the circles that give you a boost through the air, and if you miss one you'll fall to your death. Our tip is to not move the camera angle as it quickly becomes disorienting.</p><h3 id="Moon_Market">Moon Market</h3><p>It's time to rescue some cats! Mio and Zoe have a total of four cats to rescue in order to open some gates that reveal the path forward. When you get the Moon Market itself, make sure to interact with the many elements around the town square, especially the potions.</p><h3 id="Notebook">Notebook</h3><p>This beautiful sketched art level sees Mio and Zoe on a quest to rescue a prince. It's easily located within the Factory level, as Zoe will point it out with an audio cue. As you traverse the level, Zoe will rewrite the story, and areas of the level will appear, disappear, and be modified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757"></a><figcaption>Birthday Cake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><h3 id="Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</h3><p>This is one of the most fun side stories in Split Fiction. Remember the SSX games? This is Split Fiction's version of those. Mio and Zoe take to futuristic snowboards, with the goal of racking up the best score possible.</p><h3 id="Space_Escape">Space Escape</h3><p>Mio and Zoe face the challenge of running out of oxygen in space. The grappling hook mechanic from earlier in the game returns with a twist as the two wrestle with zero gravity. There isn't a time limit, despite the fact Mio encourages Zoe to work as quickly as she can, but if you take too long the gravity meter will deplete so it's best to hurry along anyway. Make sure you work with your co-op partner to find oxygen tanks before it's too late.</p><h3 id="Birthday_Cake">Birthday Cake</h3><p>One of Mio's rare 'fun' side stories, she wrote this when she was younger. You'll control teeth that need to find their way through the level via bright cartoon platforming sections. Eventually, after lighting the candles on the birthday cake, you'll end up in a dentist's office trying to survive.</p><p>Now that you've ticked off all of the side stories, why not check out how to hatch the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-hatch-the-underlands-bird-egg/1100-6529869/" data-ref-id="1100-6529869">Underlands bird egg</a>, or how to get through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-get-past-underlands-piranhas/1100-6529867/" data-ref-id="1100-6529867">piranha-infested waters</a>, in case you're having trouble.</p>

                <p>The music world lost a legend this week, when Roy Ayers passed away at the age of 84. The jazz-funk pioneer was also the voice of Fusion FM, the in-game radio station in GTA IV.</p><p>Rockstar Games paid tribute to the late "Everybody Loves the Sunshine" musician in a social media post, saying, "Rest In Peace to the pioneer of Jazz Funk and host of Fusion FM, the legend Roy Ayers."</p><p>Ayers hosted <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_FM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fusion FM</a>, one of many in-game radio stations for GTA IV, and he was known for his passionate and exuberant presentation style, and quotes like, "Try to be happy all the time." Some of the songs featured on Fusion FM included Ayers' own "Funk In The Hole," along with tunes like "The Edge" by David McCallum and "Holy Thursday" by David Axelrod.</p><p>You can listen to more of the songs from Fusion FM through the Spotify playlist below.</p><p>Ayers' family <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoyAyers/posts/pfbid0c4uWZoookuetVWmeuKdhskTEEcBCEYyzfYfsRqmT27iH1tbnASY48GWD83pNZ1bdl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a statement</a> this week confirming he passed away on March 4 in New York City after a long illness. "He lived a beautiful 84 years and will be sorely missed. His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming," the family said.</p><p>"Everybody Loves the Sunshine" is Ayers' most enduringly popular song, and it was sampled more than 100 times by artists like Dr. Dre with his song "My Life" and "The Dream" by Outkast.</p><p>Music is expected to play a major role in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. It was recently reported that DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6. The report went on to say there is potential for other real-life artists to appear in the game as well with their own radio stations. GTA 6 launches this fall for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

The new architecture is paired with AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators that aim to improve functionality outside of gaming. If you're a streamer or like to record gameplay, AMD says the upgraded display engine offers enhancements for creators.</p><p>The RX 9070 Series features 16GB GDDR6 memory, which is said to offer a 20% performance boost over the older RX 7900 GRE. The RX 9070 XT bumps that to a 40% performance increase. Other highlights include FSR 4 for upscaling, a Software Manager that ensures your cards are always running the latest drivers, and pricing that starts at $549 for the RX 9070 and $600 for the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>Prices are a bit higher than that, however, as companies like ASUS, Gigabyte, and PowerColor are selling their models for around $700. Despite the heftier prices, they’re still selling out remarkably fast. Amazon seems to be the last one holding on to inventory--here’s a quick look at what’s available at the time of writing.</p><h2>All AMD 9070 GPUs at Amazon</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRWCF9J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS TUF Radeon RX 970 OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $710</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QZC9P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $670</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QG2KW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 XT (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $730</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRMZDH6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $720</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for gear to pair with the new GPU, check out the <a href="https://howl.link/kb1lb0edfi9v4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17412765738662?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 8-Core Processor</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>'s Underlands are stunningly beautiful, but some areas are deceptively dangerous. Throughout the level you'll be faced with the challenge of piranha-infested water, and some of these aren't as easy to cross as they first seem.</p><p>The girls can shapeshift throughout this level. While Mio is safe in her "otter" form--which, if you ask us, looks much more like a lizard, Zoe isn't as lucky. If Zoe enters the water as a human, fairy, or tree, she will quickly become piranha food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958"></a><figcaption>Wall running can save Zoe from piranhas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png"></figure><p>Some of the safe methods forward aren't very obvious. During the first area of piranha waters there is a short platforming section until you end up stranded on a patch of grass. While Mio can swim through the water, she soon faces a roadblock where Zoe needs to give her some help to life a barrier. At this point, Zoe should wall run on the left-hand wall. Don't worry, we forgot wall running was a thing too.</p><p>If you're struggling to make the distance, try angling Zoe towards the middle of the wall, jump dashing to get as far along as possible, and then wall running before jump dashing to the next platform. From here, Zoe should shapeshift into the tree and use the areas on the wall to grapple from point to point until the next safe platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959"></a><figcaption>Use Zoe's tree form to grapple across water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg"></figure><p>After landing there, you'll see a large rock blocks the way. As the tree, Zoe can lift the rock to allow Mio to get through. Here, Mio should shift into the gorilla form to break the log. When she is in a safe space, Zoe should let go of the giant rock which will fly forward and break through the barrier.</p><p>After a short cutscene, the two need to forge forward once more. Complete the platforming section until you find yourself looking over a large ledge to a round pool of water. Zoe can turn into a fairy and fly across the water to the flower stream which will carry her across the water to safety. As her gorilla form, Mio should use the pink leaves to swing across to the water and then quickly shift into her otter form as she drops to the water. Here, she can safely swim through a gap in the rocks underwater.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960"></a><figcaption>Some sections require quick shapeshifting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg"></figure><p>The next piranha waters are shortly afterwards. Zoe will need to use the grapples on the left wall before quickly shifting into her fairy form to fly towards the flower streams that will carry her to safety. Mio can use the same grapples before turning into her otter form in midair and swimming to the next section.</p><p>After yet more platforming and a puzzle sequence, Zoe and Mio find more piranha-infested waters. Here, Mio will need to transport a large plant stalk that Zoe is clinging to in order to save her from the waters, as well as some new contenders: flesh-eating flowers. To begin, Zoe just needs to slide up and down the stalk to remain out of the flowers' reach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961"></a><figcaption>Another important wall running section</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg"></figure><p>When they reach the platform, Zoe needs to go on to it and turn into her tree form. By grappling the flower bud on the wall, she can make the flowers on the wall retract, meaning that Mio is free to transport the stalk through to the next section, and Zoe can transform into her fairy form to quickly fly through and rejoin the stalk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962"></a><figcaption>Not all stalks will float for long</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg"></figure><p>In the next area, Mio needs to drag the stalk close to the flowers on the right so that Zoe can grapple across them and attach to the second stalk that's already waiting there. This pole will quickly begin to sink in the water, so Mio needs to swim around and bring the first stalk with her for Zoe to attach to.</p><p>That's all of the piranha water sections in the Underlands and how to safely navigate them. Along the path forward on the right you'll find the next Split Fiction side story, so be sure to complete that before moving on.
