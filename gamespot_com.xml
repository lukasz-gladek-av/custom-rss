                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k20/" data-ref-id="5000-500607">WWE 2K20</a> was, in no uncertain terms, an abject disaster. For a series so often insulated in its wrestling fandom bubble, it was trending on social media for a period in late 2019 after it launched because of how severe and sometimes hilarious the bugs were. The game was so poorly received that the series actually took a year off. This is practically unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and sports entertainment) games. Since then, WWE 2K has rebounded incredibly over the course of several games.</p><p dir="ltr">You could argue the WWE 2K series, like Cody Rhodes, finished its story last year, with a great game that does most of what it wants to do very well. Now, like WWE's poster boy is learning week in and week out, heavy lies the crown. Where does the series go from here? To a great extent, the goal has already been achieved. The belt is around the game's waist. At the same time, "the story" continues unabated when the next game is perpetually coming down the pipeline, so there's no opportunity to pause and enjoy the fruits of your labor. After several hours with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a>, this next chapter seems like another step up, even as what might ultimately conclude the next chapter hasn't yet been revealed in full.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791"></a><figcaption>In an annualized video game, like in pro wrestling, the story is never truly over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k22/" data-ref-id="5000-529940">WWE 2K22</a> was a "comeback year," lead combat designer Derek Donahue told me. "We had extra time. There was no 2K21. We also rebuilt the game. We redid so many core systems, but we still hadn't been able to redo everything we wanted. I think you could look at [2K22], and it's almost unrecognizable from the engine and the tools that we were working with back on 2K20, especially. But it's taken many, many years to get to a point where now this feels like our game and the way that we've always envisioned being able to work on it and build it."</p><p dir="ltr">Donahue spoke to how the last two games helped reshape the culture around the series. "[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k23/" data-ref-id="5000-580650">2K23</a>] was a unique kind of challenge, in the sense that, now we have to do it in a year like we used to, right? We didn't have the extra time. It was really, really gratifying to pull off what we did with [2K23], especially WarGames and all that. [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k24/" data-ref-id="5000-615521">2K24</a>] was finally, like, 'Can you repeat it?' And I feel like we're at the point where we've proven ourselves and said, 'Hey, we can come back to this annual franchise, make huge improvements each year with the game on its own, standing alone as something that feels good.' But it also, of course, ups the stakes, because expectations are higher than they've ever been, so it's about meeting those expectations."</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, the perception was that WWE 2K20 fell apart because Yuke's, the Japanese studio making WWE games since 2000, left the series, and the team that remained wasn't able to overcome that absence. Donahue told me that's not exactly the case. More accurately, the team that would replace Yuke's didn't really exist yet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yuke's made the game for, like, 20 years," Donahue said. "It's a huge amount of institutional knowledge they have. And the goals that we had when setting out from 2K20 and beyond were to modernize a lot of systems. I think when a game gets as big as ours is, it is an extremely hard challenge to take something that works <em>now</em>, but needs to be rebuilt to do something for <em>tomorrow</em>; it takes so many resources, and you have to pick and choose what you're going to do, and to do that in an individual year just seemed insurmountable.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it was a huge change in the way that we work on the game, and what goals we are setting, and what expectations we have for ourselves and for the product. To bring everything in-house was a massive effort. When we worked with Yuke's, it was like 20-something people in our office, including designers, producers, some entrance cutscene animators, but almost everything else was happening across the world with the people who we spoke with and translated emails and had weekly meetings with, but it was so disconnected from our work and made it really challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189"></a><figcaption>Intergender matches are finally playable, so you can pit Rhea against Dom in any kind of match you prefer... or even all of them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We always knew we wanted to be able to sit next to an engineer and work with somebody in the same office and collaborate in a way in which we knew we'd be able to do so much more. But the gulf between where we were and where we wanted to be was so vast, and so it's really taken this time for us to finally get to this point."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features in this year's game is the third-person camera controls. Whereas past games allowed you to present matches from the real-life hardcam angle or the retro-inspired entrance-facing camera, this year's game also gives you the option to dynamically control the angle at any time using the right stick. In moments when you need the right stick to perform something in-game other than adjusting the camera, like pinning or turning an opponent, you just hold down the right trigger while you use it, like the shift key on a computer performing a secondary function.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the right trigger wasn't mapped to anything before anyway, the effect was a seamless new toy that enhanced the many matches I played, giving me directorial control of how each match was presented. It's interesting to note that the team originally built this feature for entrances, but when they liked it so much, they decided to apply it to the matches themselves, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The third-person camera is especially useful in backstage brawls, as I could swing the camera around a full 360 degrees and better see and utilize the space in settings new and old, like when I found I could climb up several structures in the WWE Archives and throw my opponent to the floor far below like he was doing a forced Mick Foley impression. I'd overlooked that space until I opted to change the camera settings during the match. With the camera's aid, my match was better off for it, translating into more stars in the game's Meltzer-like rating system.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the exciting new feature the marketing team plans to lead with, assumedly, but in practice, I expect players to come to really appreciate it, and many will prefer it as their go-to option. It's a subtle but satisfying change to a game building on a much sturdier foundation these days. However, the more broadly exciting additions to the game are--as they often are--the Showcase mode and new match types. I played three Showcase matches, which this year highlights the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty. This includes current superstars like Roman Reigns and Nia Jax, as well as past legends like The Rock and The Wild Samoans. Showcase is WWE 2K's annual history lesson and reliably a great time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191"></a><figcaption>The Bloodline Showcase arrives just as Jacob Fatu's meteoric rise feels like it's hitting a new speed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was disappointed to see the seamless transitions from gameplay to real-life stock footage from the matches have been removed, but I learned there are a few reasons for that. For one, the team said players largely didn't like that feature--that's absurd to me, but I can understand being in the minority on that one means I won't get my way. Another reason that aspect isn't on display in 2K25 is because Showcase features some fantasy matches we never got to see in real life, like The Wild Samoans taking on The Dudley Boyz in a tables match.</p><p dir="ltr">More noticeably absent from the Showcase mode is Brock Lesnar, who is such a major chapter in the story of cover star Roman Reigns that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brock-lesnar-and-vince-mcmahon-arent-playable-in-wwe-2k24-but-arent-gone-entirely/1100-6521315/">you can sometimes see the game skirting around his existence</a> for the second year in a row, like when a cutscene tells the story of Seth Rollins' famous cash-in at WrestleMania 31. Rollins pinned and had more of a feud with Reigns, but Lesnar was in that match, too, and he's entirely missing from the cutscene--not to suggest I want him there. It's just notable when the 2K team has to dodge-roll away from some of the wrestling company's past scandals.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I'm greatly looking forward to this mode, as I found last year's WrestleMania-focused match list to have filled in some of my knowledge gaps as a fan, and I have no doubt this year's will do that with The Bloodline family tree, too. It also helps that it's all narrated by Paul Heyman. Based on what I saw, Heyman is giving his fullest effort, not at all phoning it in. I don't think the man even knows how.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the new Showcase, new match types like Underground and Bloodline Rules, and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">recently announced WWE 2K25 features </a>all seem to build on last year's game in ways players are going to appreciate, my most anticipated feature of this year's game is rather simple: the addition of online multiplayer in GM mode. Equivalent to something like an Owner mode in NBA 2K or Madden, GM mode asks that you book shows, manage production, and run your roster--and to do it all so well that you actually defeat the competition--in this case, expressed as cross-company rivalries like Smackdown, Raw, and NXT, rather than something like AEW.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190"></a><figcaption>Of those I saw while playing the game, character models look excellent and, in many cases, are clearly improved from last year's.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">GM mode is already where I spend the majority of my time with the game. I love to make stars out of those who aren't yet at that level in reality, putting my own stamp on the WWE Universe. The prospect of playing it with three others online likely ensures I spend even more time in the mode this year. I'm eager to see how things like drafts and trades are implemented, but if done well, WWE 2K25's online GM mode might be my new favorite sports league I'm a part of--and there are already a few of those in my life.</p><p dir="ltr">With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25. There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year. But what I played gives the community more of what they want on top of a much sturdier foundation than the series had just a few short years ago. I have more questions to answer for myself, and I'll get to them before I've published my review, but as any patient wrestling fan would suggest, for now, I'll let it play out.</p>

                <p>Steam has added a new warning to the Steam pages of early-access games that have not been updated in a long time.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB spotted</a> this addition to the early-access widget on Steam pages. Steam has historically denoted that early access games "are not complete and may or may not change further," but it's now getting more specific as to when a game was previously updated, regardless of what the developers wrote in their early access widget. Specifically, it seems to kick in if the publicly available build of an early-access title has not seen an update in over 12 months.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atlas/" data-ref-id="5000-490221">Atlas</a>, a pirate open-world game from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ark-survival-ascended/" data-ref-id="5000-609380">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> that was released in early access in 2018 but has not gotten an update since May 2023. A message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/834910/ATLAS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Steam page</a> now reads, "Note: The last update made by the developers was over 20 months ago. The information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date." Similar messages can be found on the Steam pages for games like Pirate Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heartbound</a>, Hi-Rez Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale_Reforged" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Realm Royale Reforged</a>, and League of Geeks' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1893820/Jumplight_Odyssey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumplight Odyssey</a>.</p><p>Although Steam can't force developers to update their games or bring them out of early access, this warning at least gives potential buyers a clear warning that the game they're about to purchase hasn't been supported in a while. You can check the Steam News page of any early-access title or SteamDB to see when a game was updated last.</p>

Now, a third Dead by Daylight and Resident Evil crossover is just days away, and it's going to pit players against two of RE's most famous villains.</p><p>Dead by Daylight's latest 2v8 mode will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a>'s Nemesis and The Mastermind--aka longtime RE villain Albert Wesker--together as they hunt down Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Rebecca Chambers. All of these characters have appeared in at least one of the previous Resident Evil collaborations with this title. Dead by Daylight's original monster, The Legion, will also be a part of this event.</p><p>In an amusing touch, this collaboration is even including Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs, which have been a staple of the franchise from the beginning. At the start of each match, green and yellow herbs will spawn in random locations and survivors can use them for healing. However, if either Nemesis or Wesker get to the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a brief increase in their speed.</p><p>For the duration of the collaboration between February 10-25, all Resident Evil characters will be free to play in 2v8 mode. Just to make the RE characters feel at home, the 2v8 mode will revisit Raccoon City's Police Department--as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3. That's only one of the maps that will be featured in this 2v8 event, but the others have yet to be specified.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has also noted that there will be two survivor bots on every team in 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. Outside of the core Dead by Daylight game, Behavior and Supermassive released a spin-off title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone/" data-ref-id="5000-612203">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>.

In 2024, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">closed one of its AAA studios</a>, headed up by industry veterans including former Halo boss Joseph Staten. Netflix still has an internal game development studio, <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/team?slug=netflix-games-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix Games Studio</a>, as well as wholly owned external teams such as Night School Studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, and Next Games.</p><p>During an earnings call recently, Netflix boss Gregory Peters said Netflix has "plenty more" planned in the video game space, with the aim of launching "bigger and bigger games every year." Peters acknowledged that Netflix was in the middle of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">"refine" its strategy for game launches</a>, which might explain why the six games mentioned here are no longer being released on Netflix.</p><p>Going forward, Peters said Netflix will focus on "more narrative games" based on Netflix franchises, while at the same time launching "party and couch co-op games" for your TV delivered from the cloud. Netflix's main offerings for games currently are on mobile, but the company has--<a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/testing-games-on-more-devices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for years now</a>--worked on cloud streaming to beam games directly to your TV or computer.</p><p>"We think of this as a successor to family board-game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be. So we're excited about delivering some cool experiences in that space," Peter said.</p>

                <p>Last year saw Destiny 2 wrap up a decade-long saga, and as the live-service game prepares to enter a new storyline later this year, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdestiny-2-story-so-far-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-the-entire-destiny-2-experience-for-30-at-humble%2F1100-6529251%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble is offering a pretty great deal on the saga so far</a>. For just $30, you can get every available Destiny 2 expansion on PC, as well as a few content packs to help you beef up your arsenal.</p><p>If you've never played it, Destiny takes place in a distant future where humanity is a step away from extinction. Following a glorious golden age after the discovery of the Traveler--a god-like entity that resembles a giant golf ball--humanity was almost wiped out by an enigmatic entity known as the Witness. The Traveler intervened at the 11th hour, but the damage was done and a new dark age began. During this time, Guardians rose to become the protectors of our species, and centuries later, a new order was established.</p><p>That's where newcomers start in Destiny 2, as you'll be cast as a freshly resurrected Guardian tasked with keeping humanity safe. That's easier said than done, as with numerous hostile alien species wandering the solar system, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can choose to grab a three-item bundle for just $5, six items for $10, and the full bundle for $20.</p><p>The game is an MMO-style online firt-person-shooter that can be played solo or cooperatively, with optional PvP content as well, where the best elements take the form of complex co-op content that involves puzzle-laden dungeons and raids.</p><h3>Pay $5 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $10 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $20 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: The Final Shape and Annual Pass expansion</li></ul><p>There are some things to note with this collection. 2018's Forsaken campaign is no longer accessible in Destiny 2--although you can play a few highlight missions--and the pack for it gives you access to a selection of powerful Exotic weapons and armor that you can earn in the game. The campaign for every expansion since Shadowkeep is still accessible, and while these can be hit-or-miss in their design, they're generally fun to play in a binge gaming session.</p><p>You will need Destiny 2, but the good news is that the game is free to download. The real gem here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>, Destiny 2's best expansion thanks to its killer storyline, exciting Prismatic powers, and coolest weapons. The new Heresy storyline has begun, and this is a great way to dive into Destiny 2 before the game is shaken up with new content later this year. Since you're saving so much cash on this bundle, you can put some leftoever funds into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-wars-brings-the-dark-side-to-destiny-2-with-lightsaber-emotes-death-star-ghost-and-more/2900-6223/" data-ref-id="2900-6223">Destiny 2's new Star Wars crossover</a>, unlocking armor and accessories inspired by the popular sci-fi franchise.</p><p>While this is the only gaming bundle that Humble is offering at the time of writing, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-the-entire-destiny-2-experience-for-30-at-humble%2F1100-6529251%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscribing to Humble Choice this month</a> will get you eight PC games. The highlight here is Immortals of Aveum, and the rest of the list includes several fun fantasy and sci-fi games to check out. This is basically a deal that gives you eight games for $12, as each game is yours to own forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts has said that it might move around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s release window depending on which other games get released around the same time, presumably referring to GTA 6.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent investors call</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson said, "I do believe that this year might be a nuance to year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing." While he didn't explicitly name any games that could impact Battlefield 6's release date, it's obvious that GTA 6 is one of them. GTA 6 is currently set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Fall 2025</a>, but it's always possible that it could be delayed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios</p>
      </div>
<p>Yesterday, EA revealed that Battlefield 6 is due out during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">2026 fiscal year</a>, meaning that it'll release sometime between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. Battlefield games traditionally launch during fall, with the current rumor being an October 2025 release. However, if GTA 6 launches close to that time, EA is certainly willing to pivot.</p><p>Wilson said, "But if we got close to that timeframe and believe that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player-acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."</p><p>Players can get a chance to test out the new Battlefield early through EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs community program soon</a>.</p>
