                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> is currently in its second weekend, and players are still adsorbing the latest entry to the franchise. Meanwhile, Digital Foundry has shared its technical breakdown from the first weekend of Battlefield 6's open beta, and the early verdict is very good.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDVDQbgL3Rs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDVDQbgL3Rs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's not to say that the open beta was flawless. In the opening minutes alone, DF broke down some of the issues with the destructible environments. There are occasional glitches, including pieces of rubble floating in air without being connected to the structure around them. Battlefield 6's buildings appear to fall apart using a state-based system rather than registering unique damage or breaking points. Yet it's still an improvement over Battlefield 2049 and Battlefield 5.</p><p>Visually, DF saw the best results when running the SSGI option on PC, which allowed for more natural lighting, and suggested that this feature should be included for PlayStation 5 Pro. Unsurprisingly, the PS5 Pro performed better than the standard PS5, but the gap wasn't as great as it was between the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. In a side-by-side comparison, the S noticeably struggled to keep up with the on-screen details that the X handled more smoothly.</p><p>Even in the beta's current state, DF said that Battlefield 6 "is very shippable at the moment" and added that it has "a level of mechanical polish that feels top-notch." However, DF added that the game could really use some raytracing embellishments and that it doesn't feel innovative in the way that some of the previous titles have.</p><p>Among players, one of the current complaints is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">the size of the 12v12 Rush mode</a> is too small, but the final game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may solve that issue. Regardless, Battlefield 6's beta has already passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a>, as well as the record of the previous Battlefield games on Steam. The second Battlefield 6 open beta will conclude on August 17.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O | Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of Sega's announcements at EVO was the release date for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of VF5 REVO, now titled VF5 REVO World Stage. The title isn't just a multiplatform rebrand--it will be receiving a host of new updates like cross-platform play, with the crown jewel being a brand-new, dedicated single-player experience akin to the Quest Modes seen in past Virtua Fighter games.</p><p dir="ltr">I've been consistently surprised at the amount of effort Aoki and his team have been putting into updating and revitalizing this classic title, and seeing the new single-player mode was a clear sign that they'd been listening to player feedback for such an addition. But there's still one thing I needed to know: What about all the extra character customization items and decorations from Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown that hadn't made their way into REVO?</p><p dir="ltr">"We've heard from players that they want more of the items they saw in the previous releases," Aoki said. "So, in World Stage mode, there is a tournament. As you proceed, you'll be able to earn some of those customization items. I do feel like there needs to be more new items, but for now, there are no plans."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">An element where the Virtua Fighter teams have been stepping up their game has been community engagement. Besides opening an official Discord and running a global tournament series, the team has also been polling players on subjects like what controllers they use, what type of stages they dislike, and--most prominently--a global character popularity poll, with the results displayed on the official VF website.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Aoki if the polls offered up any surprises. "We did do the poll around the time the first tournament for VF5 REVO was held in Chicago, at Frosty Faustings. Seeing the players there, I really felt that the characters that are relatively unpopular in Japan tend to be popular in the West. For example, Aoi was pretty popular, Brad was very popular, Eileen was very popular. Those Western characters usually are not on the top of the list in Japan. In Japan, it's more like Akira, Jacky, Pai, [and] Sarah. It was interesting to see, and I think that was reflected in the poll as well."</p><p dir="ltr">With the launch of VF5 REVO came the game's first major balance update in over a decade. Does the team use things like polls, online play data, and other analytics to decide on gameplay tweaks?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're not really thinking about things like who to make weaker or stronger, but to put everyone on a similar level," Aoki replied. "How do we balance characters and keep what makes them distinct? Previously, a lot of players said that Taka-Arashi was too strong. But we tried not to make him specifically much weaker, but bring everyone to his level."</p><p dir="ltr">Aoki also says that further tweaking is unlikely in the near future. "There are no plans for changes right now. But as time passes, we might get to a point where we say, 'Oh, maybe we should make some balance changes, when the timing is right.' But at the moment, there are no plans. Currently, I feel like the gameplay is in a complete state, but we'll see how it goes."</p><p dir="ltr">While Virtua Fighter titles have appeared as sub-games in many of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon titles, an official series compilation has never happened. I wondered if Aoki's legacy Virtua Fighter team had ever considered doing a Capcom Fighting Collection-style release of Virtua Fighter and similar Sega fighting games, such as the Fighting Vipers series and Last Bronx. "I've definitely seen those compilations and thought, 'We should do something like that.' …By doing that, we could bring back the old fans in addition to bringing in new fans. It's something to consider."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While VF5 REVO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDp345gGlJ8">had a full tournament</a> as part of the Evo Extended Lineup, what many VF players at the event were hoping to see was the New Virtua Fighter Project. Sega did not disappoint, with a gameplay showcase trailer in the Evo Arena on finals day debuting to cheers and awestruck gasps (and my frenzied screams of delight). With my anticipation continuing at a fever pitch, I was eager to chat with producer Riichiro Yamada about the upcoming game.</p><p dir="ltr">Though only a select few characters have been shown so far, those that have, such as Akira and Wolf, have seen some big changes to their appearance. They also look markedly older, potentially indicating the passage of time in the VF world. I asked Yamada if he could tell us a bit more about these changes. "We can't say much just yet, but yes, the time has passed on. The setting for VF5 was roughly around the year 2006. This game is not a parallel world or an alternate universe--it's based on a certain timeline."</p><p dir="ltr">Yamada also elaborated on how they're approaching character design this time around: "So up until now, the characters have been designed based on their combat style, with a short backstory for each character. We're redesigning them now based on their lifestyle, why they are fighting, what they are fighting for. That's the new approach that we've been taking."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the most talked-about elements of what's been shown so far--and that's been generating even more buzz with the Evo gameplay showcase trailer--has been the realism and fluidity of the combat animation, with details like characters having distinct guarding animations for specific attacks. "We really want people to be able to see the changes that we've made," says Yamada. "Virtua Fighter up until now might have been seen as very plain, not very flashy. However, we don't want to change it up too drastically--we want a cool, flashy sense of realism. Change it, but don't lose the essence."</p><p dir="ltr">"In the process of creating this game, I'm always thinking, 'What can we progress? What can we evolve? What can we make improvements on?' When I was a child, I used to watch kung-fu movies. Those movies make people and their combat look very exciting. I really wanted to bring that element into the game--the flow, like the smoothness, all the things I used to see in those classic kung-fu movies, you know, make people excited by watching those.

skills executed with directional movements. Only one game in the series--Virtua Fighter 3--significantly altered the control scheme by adding a fourth button. With the new Virtua Fighter making some clear visual changes, I wondered if the game would try anything new with the control scheme. "We're trying a lot of different things as we're fleshing out gameplay," Yamada answered. "But VF started as an arcade game, with deliberately simple controls. Punch-kick-guard is easy for players to grasp. So while I can't give specifics, the concept that I have in mind is 'anyone can play anyone can play easily, without any stress.'"</p><p dir="ltr">This being a game by Ryu ga Gotoku Studio--a team known for its storytelling prowess and character-building--many are expecting a heavy emphasis on story this time around compared to previous titles. "Previously, VF lacked much of an in-game narrative. Again, I can't say too much, but I would like people to look forward to how we put the narrative and gameplay elements together at the finish line."</p>

<section><p>Amid uncertainty for the future of alternative games, these developers share a resolve to keep going.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When thousands of works were deindexed from Itch just a few weeks ago, livelihoods hung in the balance.</p><p dir="ltr">Itch hosted the works of developers, artists, writers, and zinesters. It was (and is) home to taboo pornography, garden-variety smut, video game memoirs, and game jam detritus. Over the last five years, it has perhaps become best known for hosting massive charity bundles, supporting causes like Black Lives Matter, Ukraine war relief, and Palestinian liberation. Those bundles were lined with small projects from hobbyist creators alongside big hits from professional developers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">When payment processors forced Itch to de-index thousands of games </a>following a pressure campaign from a right-wing anti-porn group, they threatened all of these avenues of artistic expression and financial income.</p><p dir="ltr">Nathalie Lawhead, a developer and artist who has hosted their work on Itch for years, is one of the creators who could be affected by the large-scale push for increased censorship. Their game, Everything is Going to Be Okay, is part of the permanent collection in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. But despite its acceptance into a major hub of mainstream arts culture, their work has struggled to find a home in the world of video games.</p><p dir="ltr">"The work I host on Itch is all the work that I had struggled in the past to get on mainstream storefronts... I can't count the number of times that my work has been rejected because of reasons like ’simulated error’ (glitch art), or because it features a visual style a storefront deems inappropriate, or because it is built a certain way that's not standard enough for these storefronts," Lawhead said over email.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead's work is not, strictly speaking, "gamey." They have described Everything is Going to Be Okay as a zine, and their upcoming game Blue Suburbia as an interactive poem. Lawhead's words and their work reflect a broader truth about Itch: that it has acted as a bastion for the weird and off-center from its inception.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338" data-ratio="0.6669167291823" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338"></a><figcaption>An image from Lawhead's Everything is Going to Be Okay</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Lawhead and many other developers, the mass de-indexing represents a threat to that weirdness, whether their works are NSFW or not. In our conversation, Lawhead emphasized, "We are losing our ability to create work like this, slowly."</p><p dir="ltr">Other developers worry about the effect these bans will have on their thought process.</p><p dir="ltr">"I almost included a sex scene in my game Spring Gothic, but if I had put a sex scene in there, it would have been delisted," visual novel developer and critic Kastel said on a phone call. "I don't want to think like that. That's self-censorship."</p><p dir="ltr">For Howling Angel Games founder Olivia Nenmyx, their freedom to approach sensitive topics was hard-won.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had a lot of religious or psychological guilt around abnormal kink," they said over Zoom. "It took a lot of therapy and encouragement to start writing porn."</p><p dir="ltr">It's that experience that makes them determined to fight for the right of expression, but also frightened of what this precedent could mean.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know first-hand how strong the pressure to fall-in-line can be. I see a lot of people shying away from or not expressing themselves in ways that are controversial," Nenmyx said.</p><p dir="ltr">In kind, Kastel sees a danger in trying to police more taboo work.</p><p dir="ltr">"The executives, they don't really care if works are SFW or NSFW. Those are terms that creators and players decide," she said. "In the end, the payment processors are deciding everything and they have their own paradigms."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339"></a><figcaption>An image from Kastel's Spring Gothic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to these concerns, the de-indexing has caused a lot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-greatest-pc-games-of-2024-was-removed-from-itch-io-search-results/1100-6533495/">confusion and misinformation</a>. Press and players cited Consume Me and Mouthwashing as examples of affected games, but Itch had actually de-indexed both games before receiving pressure from payment processors, for unrelated reasons. The mess has caused some developers to criticize Itch fiercely, claiming the storefront should have done more, both to protect developers and warn them about what was happening.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead, however, believes that Itch deserves some benefit of the doubt.</p><p dir="ltr">"They don't have the resources that a place like Steam does," Lawhead said. "They are about as indie as I am. It's not hard to knock something like that off its feet and make it impossible for it to get back up... The only way to fight this is to understand that we are all in this together, and that includes<a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow "> Itch.io</a> too."</p><p dir="ltr">But the question remains: How and where should independent artists share their work? As "someone that's already tried every possible alternative" and "that's been very vocal about alternatives out there," Lawhead admits they are skeptical there are real substitutes for Itch. Indeed, in the weeks since this policy changed the landscape of Itch, no obvious new options have emerged--although the dust is still settling and it is unclear what will remain in the aftermath or if Itch's policies will change. But the threat payment processors pose to marginal work is bigger than Itch or even Steam. True alternatives may be hard to find.</p><p dir="ltr">Some developers are already planning to divest. While Nenmyx wants to maintain a relationship with Itch, they are actively looking for alternatives and have added a storefront to their studio's website.</p><p dir="ltr">"I will continue to host free demos on Itch to try and get people onto my site, but I don't think I'm going to host paid content on Itch in the future," they said. "That's not set in stone though."</p><p dir="ltr">Kastel believes that trust will be slow to return, if it comes back at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even if Itch survives, people are going to be concerned that their games will be pulled off," Katel said. "The optimal way is probably, make a jam on Itch, but also upload a mirror copy somewhere else, like the Internet Archive."</p><p dir="ltr">But while individuals scramble for potential solutions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">the stakes of the broader fight remain high</a>. For Lawhead, the fate of Itch could set a precedent that would affect our online lives in every way.</p><p dir="ltr">"Given the bigger context of how corporations and monopolies have funneled everyone into these heavily-controlled walled gardens that now occupy our daily online lives, or even the way us developers can distribute software...

                <p>The Joy-Con 2's mouse controls may lead to some innovative titles on Nintendo Switch 2, including the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drag-x-drive-review/1900-6418394/" data-ref-id="1900-6418394">Drag x Drive</a>. This <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-drag-x-drive-trailer-makes-the-game-look-like-a-great-arm-workout/1100-6533544/" data-ref-id="1100-6533544">3-on-3 wheelchair basketball game</a> relies on the mouse controls for for movement, and the most comfortable way to play is by using your legs as a surface. However, not all pants are created equal, and that's why GameSpot is sharing our test play results with several different pairs of pants.</p><p>In the interest of full disclosure, we did try playing Drag x Drive on bare legs. It's a smooth experience, but also unnecessarily painful. Perhaps some players won't mind that sensation. Regardless, we found that the material of the pants is actually very important for both comfort and consistent controls.</p><p>The worst performers were ribbed yoga pants, cargo pants, and men's dress pants. The common denominator among those picks were controller drift and lack of control. Standard dress pants worked well, but they weren't very comfortable.</p><p>Cotton jeans were one of the top performers, as were sweatpants. But for sheer comfort and smooth controls, only two options reached our S tier: velvet pants and a full length skirt. Your wardrobe choices may vary, but the results speak for themselves. </p><p>Drag x Drive is available now for Nintendo Switch 2 for only $20.</p>

                <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> seem to get that skating is a style thing as much it is a lifestyle. The board itself doesn't make the skater cool, but the bevy of customization options that'll be present at Skate's early access launch certainly will.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> from its developers, customization will be a crucial part of the experience, and it's the first thing players will do upon booting up the game. At that point, players will be able to fine tune many aspects of their avatar, such as their body shape, height, as well as tons of aspects of their face, and more.</p><p>The way that your characters moves when they're off the board--a setting that the developers are calling Locomotion--is also customizable, and you can even select gestures, which can be done both on-and-off-board.</p><p>Naturally, players will also get to trick out their clothes and boards as well, and completing challenges and missions throughout the game will net them a currency called Rip Chips. This currency is used to buy Skate's equivalent of loot boxes and increase what the team is calling a Rip Score, which sounds like an in-game leveling system. Raising your Rip Score will be a surefire way to keep unlocking more customization options, such as helmets, skirts, and shoes for the player, as well as trucks, stickers, and grip tape for your deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295" data-ratio="0.56309523809524" data-width="840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295"></a><figcaption>A skater's gotta grind. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550297,1300-4550298,1300-4550299,1300-4550300,1300-4550301" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"></figure><p>Speaking of, considering Skate will be free-to-play, it will also offer players the chance to score cosmetics via microtransactions. The Skate Shop will accept the game's premium currency, called San Van Bucks, and will be used for direct purchases, not loot boxes that leave things to chance. Alongside the shop, seasons, which are expected to run around three months at a time, and the Skate Pass should also be considered avenues by which the player can get even more cosmetics.</p><p>At the end of the update, the developers behind Skate acknowledge the possibility of sharing custom gear created by other players considering the new game's emphasis on user-generated content. Despite this, it doesn't outright confirm that it will be in the game, at least at launch, saying that when it has "something concrete to share, like a timeline, we'll make sure to let you know."</p><p>Suffice to say, there will be lots of ways to trick yourself and your board out when Skate launches and beyond. In the meantime, its most recent playtest has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-reboot-has-over-1-million-sign-ups-for-latest-playtest/1100-6533473/" data-ref-id="1100-6533473">surpassed a million signups</a>, representing an early and promising milestone for the game ahead of its release into early access later this summer. Skate will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, with mobile versions planned to come to iOS and Android at a later time.</p>
