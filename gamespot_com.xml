                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/news/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> will officially launch on December 1, and two more characters are joining its roster. Tribute Games and developer Dotemu revealed that Phoenix and Iron Man will team up with fellow heroes like Captain America, She-Hulk, Wolverine, and Spider-Man, increasing the total number of playable heroes to 15. Phoenix--X-man Jean Grey's cosmic powerhouse alter-ego--can dish out telekinetic blasts, while Iron Man uses bleeding-edge technology to clear the field of enemies.</p><p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth's mightiest mortals take on Annihilus as he launches a new campaign to take over the galaxy. Dotemu had previously worked on another licensed property, the well-received Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge for PC and console.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itVLfmX3Ts8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589194,1300-4589195,1300-4589196,1300-4589197,1300-4589198,1300-4589199,1300-4589200" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"></figure><p>The Marvel game has a beat-'em-up design at its core, and each character can pull off unique attacks. There's also the Cosmic Swap system, which allows players to harness each hero's superpowers and special abilities to create unique team-up attacks. Like its work on TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, the game has a pixel-art style designed to capture the spirit of classic Marvel games from the classic arcade era. Marvel Cosmic Invasion will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch consoles.</p><p>In other Marvel gaming news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/">Marvel's Wolverine recently got a big gameplay reveal</a>. Developer Insomniac showed off the game in action, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvels-wolverine-screenshots/2900-7075/">revealing how just how bloody and brutal</a> it's take on the popular X-Man character is going to be. While it doesn't have a firm release date yet, the studio is aiming to have it out in Q3 2026.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://rollingstone.com.br/noticia/hideo-kojima-criar-jogos-e-cansativo-mas-sinto-que-estou-realmente-vivendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, game creator Hideo Kojima kicked off a firestorm on social media as he shared his thoughts on the future of the industry. Kojima warned that relying too heavily on remaking old franchises is creatively risky and that, in the future, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI will likely be used to create these kinds of projects</a>. </p><p>Kojima has already said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he doesnâ€™t see AI as a threat</a>, though. Instead, he believes it can be a helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to focus on more imaginative work. Kojima explained that he sees AI as a "friend" in development, one that improves efficiency without replacing human leadership in creativity.</p><p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto strongly disagrees with Kojima's prediction. Okamoto stated that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+silent+hill+f&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, the latest game in the franchise, could not have been made by AI. While AI might be able to generate ideas for sequels, Okamoto believes it cannot make bold creative decisions, such as changing the setting to 1960s Japan or involving acclaimed horror writer Ryukishi07. These choices, he says, came from human insight and vision--something AI simply can't replicate at this point.</p><p>"AI may be able to put together a project for a sequel that takes place in the Silent Hill universe, but things like changing the story's setting to Japan or getting Ryukishi07 on board as a writer are the kind of bold choices AI would never be able to make," Okamoto said (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ai-could-never-come-up-with-a-sequel-like-silent-hill-f-series-producer-joins-discussion-on-ai-generated-remakes-and-sequels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton translation</a>). </p><p>Silent Hill f is a significant shift for the series, moving away from the familiar town and instead focusing on a deeply personal horror story set in historical Japan. The game follows Hinako Shimizu, a teenager dealing with overwhelming pressure from those around her. Since its release in late September, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/" data-ref-id="1100-6535077">has sold over 1 million copies</a> and received mostly positive reviews. </p><p>The debate surrounding AI in gaming has gained momentum recently, particularly with advancements in generative AI, such as Sora. Fans have utilized these tools to create parody content featuring popular franchises such as Mario and Pokemon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sora-2-ai-mario-and-pikachu-videos-seem-primed-for-nintendo-lawsuits/1100-6535191/" data-ref-id="1100-6535191">sparking concerns from companies like Nintendo regarding copyright infringement</a>. Despite the controversy, developers like Kojima and Glen Schofield (creator of Dead Space) continue to advocate for AI as a valuable tool. Schofield said that after experimenting with AI for two years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he sees it as a way to improve speed</a>, reduce costs, and support developers, not as a replacement for them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To Palworldâ€™s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it," he said. "We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p><p>It's a bold position, to be sure, especially since other big-name publishers like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA are pushing AI on their workers</a> hard. Still, Buckley is aware that the AI floodgates have opened and believes it'll worsen in time.</p><p>"I think over the next two or three years we're going to get into this weird era--and you can see it slowly happening now on Steam--of really low-quality, AI-made games," he said. "It's something that has plagued other stores but Steam had been good at keeping them out. But it's happening. This wave is coming, and I think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say, 'No, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."</p><p>Pocketpair has been accused of using AI since bursting on the scene in January 2024 with its Pokemon-but-guns game Palworld. Buckley and the rest of the Japanese studio are intimately familiar with AI scrutiny, explaining that instead of fighting the allegations, he hopes Pocketpair's position and overall work ethic prove that the developers aren't down with AI in the slightest.</p><p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," he said. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p><p>Pocketpair is currently in the middle of a tense lawsuit with Nintendo over Palworld, with the latest in the litigation being that the Pokemon maker believes mods don't constitute "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">prior art</a>." This motion essentially invalidates Palworld as a mere copycat of Pokemon, not something wholly original like Pocketpair argues.</p>
