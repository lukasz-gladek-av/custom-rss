<section><p>The Lumines series is getting a major glow-up--literally and metaphorically.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After playing 20 minutes of Lumines Arise, the team from Enhance presented me with a difficult decision. "We have another 20 or so minutes left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time asking us some questions, or would you like to play a bit more?" And as much as I wanted to jump straight into interviews and pick the minds of the folks who brought us Humanity, Tetris Effect, and Rez Infinite, I found myself betrayed by my own childlike glee.</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you mind if I do just a couple more levels?" I asked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in that moment--when the part of me that simply loves games overtook the part of me that tries her hardest to maintain a writer's sensibilities--that I realized I <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with Lumines Arise. And though of course I took time to chat with game and art director Takashi Ishihara and creative producer Mark MacDonald and enjoyed every minute of it, I left the preview event wishing that somehow the next entry in the Lumines series was back at my hotel, loaded up on my Steam Deck, and waiting for me to get back to playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't to say I didn't get enough time to get a sense of how Lumines Arise is shaping up. During the preview event, I played through a pre-made playlist of four songs followed by <em>another</em> playlist with two additional songs after I proved overly voracious. With each track lasting around four minutes, this made for around 30 minutes of Lumines Arise goodness. From what I gathered, it seems as though the mode I played essentially allows players to construct their own setlists by selecting songs from the game's main story, referred to as Journey mode. As such, I encountered the songs out of order and without the context that I assume would be provided in story mode. And yet, that didn't stop them from being visually delightful, memorable, and, most importantly, a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721"></a><figcaption>A golden-hued level that sees players arrange dark blue orbs and yellow squares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with Lumines, the overall gameplay feels very similar to Tetris: Blocks fall down, you rotate and place them to help clear the board, and "topping out" spells game over. However, whereas Tetris sees you place tetrominos of various shapes down to help form lines that then clear your board, Lumines focuses entirely on squares. Each construct you are given is 2x2 consisting of up to two different types of blocks; as you place them down, your goal is to form squares (2x2 or greater) consisting of the same block type.</p><p dir="ltr">Once a square is formed, you have until the vertical "Time Line" sweeps across the board to add to it, making the seconds between a square's construction and that sweep a rush to extend your block to a 3x3, 4x4, and so on. Though it doesn't directly correlate to the track's RPM, the Time Line helps emphasize the musicality of the game and builds up your internal rhythm. Arise also gets a new twist with its Burst meter, which slowly fills up over time and can then be used to lock a square to your grid for a few passes of the Time Line, allowing you to add to it for longer and subsequently clear more of the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this is all relatively simple to grasp, it's certainly harder in execution. And interestingly, the more I <em>thought </em>about what I was doing in Lumines Arise, the trickier things seemed to become. Fortunately, everything about Arise--from its music and visuals to its gameplay--encourages you to enter the same trance-like flow state it inhabits. Everything is fluid, stylish, and hypnotizing. And yet, there is an undeniable tension that comes hand-in-hand with these sorts of puzzle games--the ones that can grow overwhelming, constricting, and unwieldy with just a few poorly placed tiles. Ultimately, though, all this makes for wonderful juxtaposition that is not just a core part of Lumines Arise mechanically, but narratively as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712"></a><figcaption>A darker level that is largely silent and features empty boxes and clunky, metal box fans.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't play Arise's Journey mode, one of the handful of levels I did play was notably darker in tone than the others, offering a look at places the game's narrative might go. In place of pulsing lights and electronic pop was oppressive silence and mechanical groans; rather than placing down flashing circles and boxes, I was given harsh, metal box fans and hollow white boxes to try to form into squares. Within a minute, I felt incredibly tense, and told the team as much with a nervous laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">According to creative producer Mark MacDonald, this was entirely the point, as Arise's story focuses on "life's highs and lows, and how we balance the good with the bad." Naturally, actually tackling this theme and conveying these messages is a bit difficult due to the game's lack of a written narrative. Though having songs with lyrics in the game can act as a sort of "cheat," MacDonald laughed, as it gives players a more clear sense of how they are meant to feel, lyrics can often be a bit abstract or metaphorical. Atmosphere, then, is largely how the team makes this happen, and just as Lumines influenced how Enhance constructed Tetris Effect's environments and storytelling, the team said they looked to Tetris Effect to shape Arise.</p><p dir="ltr">"A challenge of our games is that we are telling stories in abstract ways and in ways only we have really done," MacDonald said. "Lumines informed Tetris Effect, and now we're seeing things circle as Tetris Effect shapes Lumines Arise."</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after this interaction, the eerie, monochromatic level started to unweave itself and came to an end. I was then greeted by two dancing chameleons, having the time of their lives, while a fast-paced song thumped away in the background. These levels are indeed an abstract and interesting take on life's "highs and lows," but they absolutely rule, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711"></a><figcaption>A funky level that features two chameleons and circles and squares to arrange.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As I bobbed my head along to the music and got back into the swing of things, game and art director Takashi Ishihara was delighted that the atmosphere he and the team had constructed was doing precisely what was intended.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some people cried when they finished Tetris Effect, and we were blown away by that response," Ishihara said. "I think people who have a deep connection to art and music--who are connected to their emotions and sensitive to atmosphere--will really respond to [Lumines Arise]."</p><p>That said, I suspect that even those coming to Lumines Arise purely for a delightful new puzzle game will still be plenty impressed. It's fun, engaging, <em>slightly</em> tense, visually spectacular, and has the same delightful fluidity that Enhance is known for delivering. All in all, I can't wait to spend more time with it once it hits PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

                <p>It's been almost a decade since the original Postal was given a modern remake in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-redux-pc-release-date-announced-ps4-edition/1100-6439661/" data-ref-id="1100-6439661">Postal Redux</a>. Now, it's time for 2003's Postal 2 to get the same treatment with Postal 2 Redux, "a ground‐up overhaul" of the original game.</p><p>Postal 2 Redux is in development with Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors, with a Kickstarter campaign slated to begin later this summer. According to the announcement, the revitalized game grew out of an initial attempt to bring Postal 2 to VR. Now, the original assets will be recreated in Unity with "enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‐up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNUeNiAplI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzNUeNiAplI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the announcement teaser doesn't have much to show off, some of the features planned for Portal 2 Redux include the ability to pet Champ the dog, as well as the addition of dynamic lighting, more refined crowds, fully breakable interiors, and an open world that can be explored without any loading screens.</p><p>According to the developers, the plan is to bring Postal 2 Redux to PC, macOS, Linux rigs, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Switch 1 or 2. However, the team notes that the final platform lineup has yet to be finalized and it may depend on stretch goals achieved through Kickstarter as well as approval from the console-makers in question.</p><p>The Kickstarter pre-launch page for Postal 2 Redux is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently online</a>, but the campaign doesn't have an official start date yet. There's no word about whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-iii-review/1900-6348436/" data-ref-id="1900-6348436">Postal 3</a> may get remake as well. That game was so poorly received among Postal fans in 2011 that Running With Scissors later retconned <a href="https://postal.fandom.com/wiki/Postal_III" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Postal 3 as a non-canonical game</a>. The most recent title in the franchise was Postal 4: No Regerts, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/" data-ref-id="1900-6417864">debuted to bad reviews</a> in 2022.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 2nd Trailer: Formidable Foes Emerge</p>
      </div>
<p>Up until now, all mainline Onimusha games have been connected narratively since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/onimusha-warlords/" data-ref-id="5000-1574">Onimusha: Warlords</a> kicked things off in 2001, often having their protagonists fighting demonic Genma and a possessed Oda Nobunaga's forces. Capcom even went through the effort of remastering the first two games in the series in the 2020s, so it could be believable that it was prepping players to understand the series' overarching narrative and lore prior to its continuation. That's not the case, though, as the only real connection is that players are still fighting Genma and Kadowaki admitted that Way of the Sword's development was separate from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-gets-a-modern-remaster-this-year/1100-6529245/" data-ref-id="1100-6529245">those remaster efforts</a>.</p><p>Players will control a new protagonist named Miyamoto Mushashi, whose face is modeled after actor Toshiro Mifune and who wields an Oni gauntlet that gives him special powers. That all may sound familiar to those who watched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflixs-onimusha-anime-brings-together-three-japanese-legends/2900-4875/" data-ref-id="2900-4875">Onimusha series on Netflix</a> last year. But once again, Kadowaki denied any sort of connection between the show and new game, even though they both feature the same character modeled after the same real-world actor. "There's absolutely no connection with the Netflix animated series," Kadowaki bluntly confirmed.</p><p>If you are planning on playing Onimusha: Way of the Sword when it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026, you at least don't have to worry about this franchise's past, as it's a clean slate narratively.</p>

Brandon Adler said in an interview that Obsidian did not set the price for the game, adding that anyone bothered by the price point should take their concerns to Microsoft.</p><p>"We're a game developer. We love to make games. We don't set the prices for our games," he said in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with GamesRadar</a>. "Like, personally, as a game developer, I wish everybody could play my game, because that's what I want out of this whole thing. But for the reasons and so like, why the $79.99 price point, you'd have to honestly talk to the Xbox folks."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is Microsoft's first $80 game, but it wasn't a total surprise, given that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">said it would begin charging $80 for some games in 2025.</a> Microsoft also raised prices on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, while there are expectations that other publishers will follow suit and start charging more as well. 2K Games has been caught up in pricing drama, too, as Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-reacts-to-price-point-controversy/1100-6531739/" data-ref-id="1100-6531739">he doesn't know if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not.</a></p><p>What Adler said about The Outer Worlds 2 lines up with what Pitchford has said about Borderlands 4. He mentioned that, as an artist, he wants as many people as possible to play his games. At the same time, he acknowledged that it's a business and the company has to keep making money to make more games. Like Adler, Pitchford also noted that he does not set prices; in his case, 2K Games is making the call.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said again and again that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">it's his job to make money and run a successful business</a>, even if this means the company has to make some tradeoffs.</p><p>"We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us," Spencer said.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. If you don't want to pay $80 for it, you can subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate and play it via your membership. Game Pass is not available on PlayStation, however.</p>

<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johan and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>
