                <p>From the moment that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-delivers-rapid-fire-antics-with-his-toughest-fight-yet/1100-6526119/" data-ref-id="1100-6526119">Shadow the Hedgehog appeared in the first trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, it seemed obvious that Sega's antihero was going to be the sequel's breakout character. But few could have predicted that it would mean Sonic 3's Build-a-Bear line would be disrupted by Shadow's resurgence.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-shadow-build-a-bear-store-online-ebay-1851735236" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Shadow's Build-a-Bear is sold out and going <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=shadow+the+hedgehog+build+a+bear&amp;_sacat=0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for ludicrous prices on eBay</a> from $300 on the low end to $1,500 at the highest. Currently, the highest amount that anyone has actually paid on eBay for Shadow is just north of $600. As you can see from the list below, that's quite a markup from the rest of Build-a-Bear's Sonic the Hedgehog 3 collection. Note that Sonic is also available in stores, but Tails is an online exclusive.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fsonic-3-sonic-plush%2F033315.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshadow-the-hedgehog-build-a-bears-are-getting-scalped-for-ridiculous-prices%2F1100-6528700%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Sonic Build-A-Bear</a> -- $34</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fsonic-3-tails-plush%2F033318.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshadow-the-hedgehog-build-a-bears-are-getting-scalped-for-ridiculous-prices%2F1100-6528700%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Tails Build-A-Bear</a> -- $34</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fsonic-3-tails-plush-with-sound%2F33318_33811.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fshadow-the-hedgehog-build-a-bears-are-getting-scalped-for-ridiculous-prices%2F1100-6528700%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Tails Build-A-Bear with sound</a> -- $42</li></ul><p>Shadow has been removed from Build-a-Bear's site, and the company reportedly has no plans to restock the character.

It has an 8-inch 1920 x 1200 LCD display with 120Hz variable refresh rate. Other features include adjustable RGB light rings around the analog sticks, two back buttons, one trackpad, and a pair of levers on the back that modify trigger tension.</p><p>Unlike the original Legion Go, this one doesn’t offer detachable gamepads or a kickstand, opting instead for a solid, streamlined design built specifically for handheld play. Lenovo increased the battery capacity from 49.2Wh to 55Wh with the Legion Go S.</p><p>Lenovo will also launch a second Windows configuration in May for $600. This lower-priced model has 16GB RAM instead of 32GB.

The Legion Go S will be the first third-party handheld that uses Valve's Steam Deck operating system. This model will receive the same updates as Valve’s Steam Deck. That means you won’t have to worry about Valve abandoning SteamOS on the Legion Go S, as the team is treating SteamOS as a unified platform regardless of which handheld you’re playing on.</p><p>While it retains the Ryzen Z2 Go chip and the 8-inch 1200p display, the SteamOS edition is limited to 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You can upgrade your SSD or expand the storage capacity via microSD.</p><p>For comparison, the Steam Deck starts at $399 for the 256GB model with a 7-inch LCD display. The 512GB model with a 7.4-inch OLED display costs $549, and the 1TB OLED edition goes for $649.</p><p>If you opt for the Legion Go S, you'll get a faster processor and a larger 8-inch screen with higher resolution--1200p compared to the Steam Deck's 800p resolution. That said, the Legion Go S uses an LCD panel, whereas the 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck models have better OLED screens.</p><p>Lenovo went with a more conventional control layout with offset sticks, while the Steam Deck's two sticks, D-pad, and face buttons are essentially aligned. The layout admittedly looks odd, but the Steam Deck is a lot comfier than it looks. Valve's handheld has four remappable back triggers, while Lenovo's new handheld only has two. The Steam Deck also has two large trackpads, whereas the Legion Go S has one small pad. Adjustable trigger tension is unique to the Legion Go S.</p><p>With these differences, it'll be interesting to see how the Legion Go S stacks up against the Steam Deck.

Players can now buy the VIPs bundle, which allows players to don special masks inspired by the TV show.</p><p>The VIPs Tracer Pack, as it's called, includes two Operators--the Panther Mask VIP and the Lion Mask VIP. The bundle also includes the "Choicest" launcher, the "Lacquered" sniper rifle, and the "Satin Slayer" SMG. A new frag grenade skin, "Death Plated," is included in the bundle as well.</p><p>What's more, players get a new finishing move, "Pinky Up," as well as the "Gilded" emblem, "List Required" calling card, and "Very Important Player" loading screen. You can see this content in action in the video below. The bundle costs 2,400 COD Points, or about $20.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KTvPAodyBY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KTvPAodyBY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty's Squid Game event also includes the Pink Guards Tracer Pack and the upcoming Young-hee Tracer Pack. These are separate from the new Squid Game Event Pass, which is a paid battle pass specifically for the Squid Game event that includes its own set of unique rewards based on the show.</p><p>The Squid Game Event Pass is the first such microtransaction offering in Call of Duty. Its release has ignited a debate among players about how far Activision will go to make money from microtransactions. Initially, Activision did not reveal the price of the Event Pass, but later did, confirming it would be 1,100 COD Points, or about $10.</p><p>In addition to the new store bundles, the Call of Duty / Squid Game event brought new modes to the game, including Red Light, Green Light and Pentathlon.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>This story includes content some readers may find disturbing.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Former employees of Brandoville Studios--an Indonesian support studio that worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> before closing its doors in August--recently stated that they were subjected to mental and physical abuse while working on the game. Now, Ubisoft has responded to their claims.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-deeply-disturbed-by-damning-reports-of-abuse-at-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio" rel="nofollow ">told Eurogamer</a> when asked to comment on the controversy. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p><p dir="ltr">The claims of abuse were first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9HQ2C6h_4">reported by People Make Games</a> in a 50-minute YouTube video uploaded earlier this week. In the video, former Brandoville employee Christa Sydney alleges that she was subjected to various forms of abuse by Kwan Cherry Lai. Cherry Lai is the wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai and was responsible for overseeing Brandoville's daily operations while the studio was still open.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sydney, Cherry Lai created a toxic work environment, using gossip to alienate employees and manipulating employees' schedules to an extreme degree. But the alleged misconduct didn't stop there--Sydney says Cherry Lai forced her to stay awake for days at a time, only allowing her a few minutes of sleep over the four days leading up to the 2022 External Development Summit conference. Sydney also alleges that Cherry Lai forced her to engage in Christian religious practices, made her write lines as a punishment, and even demanded Sydney send over photos of her daily work outfits for approval before coming into the office.</p><p dir="ltr">"5:30 AM we need to wake up and then like, pray to god, and then [at] like 6:00 AM we need to go do our exercise, and then 8:00 AM shower," Sydney said of Cherry Lai's desire to control employees' schedules. "9:00 AM be at the office, and then even like, what time we need to drink water--she also put it in the schedule. And then what time we eat, what time we go to bed… that sort of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">But according to Sydney, that was just the tip of the iceberg, and Cherry Lai's behavior would eventually escalate to physical abuse. Sydney says she was forced to film a video in which she slapped herself in the face 100 times as a form of punishment, and also claims she was directed to slam her head into a doorframe repeatedly before being forced to apologize for "mistakes."</p><p dir="ltr">"The earliest record that I have was a recording of me hitting myself in the mouth until it bled, and then she wanted me to take a picture of the blood in my mouth," Sydney shared in the People Make Games video, which includes chat logs, photos, and recorded footage backing up her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney previously spoke out about her experiences in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">2021 interview with People Make Games</a>, and says Lai forced her to film an apology video retracting her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Other former Brandoville employees have come forward with reports of abuse as well. Caesarion Balthazar, who also worked at Brandoville while the studio was still in operation, claims that Cherry Lai took large chunks of his paychecks, adding up to the equivalent of a month's salary. When he tried to leave the studio, he was told he owed Lai money for a series of training programs. There was a problem, however: He hadn't engaged in any of the training programs he was being charged for. Syifana Afiati, who worked at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024, claims she was overworked during her pregnancy, and refused time off when her child died shortly after birth.</p><p dir="ltr">After the studio was liquidated in 2024, Cherry and Ken Lai formed a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was hired on there as well, but later left after another incident with Cherry pushed her over the edge.</p><p dir="ltr">"She was taunting me. She was challenging me, basically," Syndey said. "I thought to myself, 'She already doesn't have anyone else [to work for her].' I was quite literally the only person left with her, and she was still doing this to me. But this time around I was like, 'You know what? I'm so tired, it's like 2:00 AM. I should order a cab home. When she realized that I wasn't going back to her, she panicked."</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney claims Cherry threatened her, but after years of abuse Sydney was at her limit. She refused to return to her position and began sharing her story, providing videos, photos, and text messages to back up her claims, which led to her story getting picked up by various news outlets and social media sites in Indonesia.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Ubisoft has denounced Cherry Lai's alleged actions, Lai herself gave a bizarre response when contacted for comment by People Make Games.</p><p dir="ltr">"To me, my part of the story is not important as long as my team are good and safe now," Cherry Lai said of the accusations. She refused to provide further comment.</p><p>Employees interviewed by People Make Games say that although CEO Ken Lai was not directly abusive toward them, he enabled his wife's conduct. At the time of writing, Ken Lai has not made any statements regarding the alleged abuse his wife engaged in. Brandoville Studios employees also worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/">Age Of Empires IV</a> during the timeframe the abuse allegedly took place, but Microsoft has not yet commented on the People Make Games video, nor has it addressed the allegations of abuse by Cherry Lai.</p>

After the events of Arcane Season 2, Mel returns to Noxus, and her new in-game appearance shows her embracing her Noxian heritage. Riot says the development team and those working on Arcane came together to define Mel's new look and how it should be portrayed both in-game and in the show, with "game inspiring show and vice versa."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z76xgEYgjt0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z76xgEYgjt0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But Mel's big entrance is more than just looks.

                <p>For the better part of two decades, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dwarf-fortress/">Dwarf Fortress</a> has been the passion project of brothers Tarn and Zach Adams. Although the acclaimed fantasy simulation game has technically remained in development since its debut in 2006, Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode will launch out of beta on January 23. The announcement was sent out with the following video, and an update about the latest changes in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg99hUv4YEY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kg99hUv4YEY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dwarf Fortress allows players to control a clan of dwarves as they stake out their place in a procedurally generated fantasy world. Adventure Mode shakes up the formula by allowing players to step into a roguelike-style RPG and explore the worlds that were created during their time in the standard game. Adventure Mode also allows players to accept quests and look for lost treasures, among other activities.</p><p>Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando have shared Dwarf Fortress' latest updates <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its Steam page</a>. Most of the changes were for Adventure Mode, including enhanced options for character creation, the addition of Adventure Mode's soundtrack to Fortress Mode, and even the option for child and baby portraits.</p><p>Dwarf Fortress has been around for nearly 19 years, but it didn't launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-arrives-on-steam-with-fancy-graphics-december-6/1100-6508880/">Steam until December 2023</a> with a paid version of the game that had new graphics, music, and more. The game's incredible success on Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-game-devs-reveal-whats-next-for-them-after-the-games-sudden-success/1100-6522418/" data-ref-id="1100-6522418">allowed the Adams brothers to purchase a new home</a>. Now that Adventure Mode is on the horizon, Tarn Adams indicated on Steam that the focus will return to Fortress Mode "very soon." He also added that both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode will continue to be supported by future updates.</p>
