                <p>2017's Star Wars Battlefront II from Battlefield developer DICE is popular again, with player numbers jumping on Steam to near record-levels. This is happening amidst a fan campaign for EA to make another entry in the popular, multimillion-selling franchise.</p><p>The game reached 9,292 concurrent players on Steam in the past 24 hours, which is just shy of its all-time peak concurrent record of 10,489, according to data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The game was hovering between 1,500 and 3,000 peak concurrent players until mid-April 2025, when player numbers began surging for the eight-year-old game.</p><p>This was around the time that the Star Wars TV series Andor came back for its second and final season on Disney+.</p><p>Exactly why the game is experiencing a big uptick is unknown, but it comes amid a campaign for a third game in the new series. Recently, actor Muhannad Ben Amor from Andor posted on his Instagram story, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Star Wars gotta give us Battlefront 3 ASAP."</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront subreddit</a> is experiencing lots of activity and engagement lately, with fans discussing how much they're enjoying returning to the game. Battlefront II is included with EA Play, so that means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also get it as part of their membership.</p><p>2015's Battlefront and 2017's Battlefront II combined to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">more than 33 million copies</a>, but despite that, EA has not confirmed any plans for more entries in the series. It was reported in 2024 that EA rejected a pitch from DICE for Battlefront III due to the licensing costs it would have to pay Disney. The report said a potential Battlefront III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">would need to sell 20% more copies to justify its production budget.</a></p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005, and it was also developed by Pandemic. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">the second trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was finally released by Rockstar Games, and as Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick put it, it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-broke-the-internet-take-two-boss-says/1100-6531601/" data-ref-id="1100-6531601">broke the internet</a>." To date, it has over one billion views on YouTube, so it was inevitable that fans would remix the original trailer into a new form. Now, someone has released a remake of the GTA 6 trailer with a PlayStation 2-inspired makeover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axZp9CH8prU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The PS2 Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was posted on YouTube by a user called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foosmoke</a>, and there appears to be some subtle humor in this video. There's clipping when Jason robs the convenience store, which is definitely true to a PS2 experience. Jason also appears to have more trouble lifting weights in this version <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-jason-does-he-even-lift-bro-heres-how-much-he-can-bench/1100-6531346/" data-ref-id="1100-6531346">than he did in the actual trailer</a>.</p><p>The Vice City glimpsed in this trailer remake is also noticeably less populated than the one seen in the original trailer. The PS2-era GTA games couldn't handle subtle expressions and body language in their character models like the new game can. And without those touches, this take on the GTA 6 trailer doesn't have the same resonance as the original.</p><p>Digital Foundry recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-was-only-30fps-and-it-may-be-too-much-for-switch-2/1100-6531393/" data-ref-id="1100-6531393">an in-depth look at the second GTA 6 trailer</a> and concluded that it won't be able to run on Nintendo Switch 2 despite the new system's greatly improved hardware. This PS2-style incarnation of the game would probably work for both incarnations of the Switch, but who would want to play this downgraded version after seeing what GTA 6 really looks like?</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on May 26, 2026. That delay is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">estimated to cost the video game industry approximately $2.7 billion</a> in 2025, according to Ampere Analysis.</p>

There's no release date for it yet, but the game will be coming to PC later this year.</p><p>This new version of the classic RTS has been updated for modern systems, and players can expect 4K support, upscaled textures, and image-based lighting to enhance the visuals. While developer Relic Entertainment is aiming to retain the classic experience of the game, there will be a few other modern touches like an improved gameplay camera alongside a HUD that has been optimized for widescreen gaming.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CLDiE8OQ1M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The modding community can also expect to be catered to, as the game has been upgraded to support 64-bit platforms. This means that 20 years of community mods will continue to be supported.</p><p>In terms of content, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will include all of the standalone expansion content--Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. First released in 2004, Dawn of War is still widely regarded to be one of the best Warhammer 40K strategy games. Its first sequel, Dawn of War 2, was released in 2009, and the threequel Dawn of War 3 launched in 2017.</p><p>In case you missed it, there were several other big announcements during Warhammer Skulls. While the sequel to the retro-flavored Boltgun won't be out for a while, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced-very-unexpected-spin-off-out-now/1100-6531732/">you can sharpen your typing skills in a free spin-off game</a> that's out right now.

                <p>Waiting for your favorite boomer shooter to get a sequel while currently enjoying the latest Doom game? No, it's not 1993, because Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has been officially revealed, and it looks to deliver on all the fast-paced action, bloody dismemberment, and incredibly mean taunts that fans expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Malum Caedo, the Space Marine who players controlled in the first game, will return for a sequel that promises to visit "never-before-seen locations in the Warhammer 40,000 universe." Alongside returning enemies like Nurglings, newcomers like the Bloodletters and Juggernauts will also be trying their best to turn Caedo into a pile of giblets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer presented during Warhammer Skulls 2025 was relatively short but showed off Caedo blasting away a variety of enemies and slicing them to tiny pieces with his chainsword. If it's half as good as the original game, it should be both a worthy homage to classic '90s shooters and a must-play game for the franchise's fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is scheduled to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, but developer Auroch Digital has something very different to keep fans happy until then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l-3morfa24" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5l-3morfa24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Available now, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - Words of Vengeance is essentially the 40,000 take on Typing of the Dead. Players have to type out words from the extensive Warhammer 40,000 lore to destroy enemies of the Emperor. The best part is it's completely free, though because of its core gameplay, it's only available on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">For more from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer Skulls 2025</a>, check out everything announced during the event, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Dark Heresy</a>.</p>
