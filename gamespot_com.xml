                <p>Amazon has revealed the dates for this year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day sales event</a>. The 2025 iteration of the massive sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime members</a> kicks off July 8 and runs through July 11. The four-day window makes it the longest Prime Day sale yet. As the name suggests, Prime Day debuted as a 24-hour flash sale in 2015 before moving to a two-day structure in 2019. And now the sales event has doubled in size once again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a>.</p><h2>Amazon Prime Day 2025 Start/End Times</h2><p>Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially begins on Tuesday, July 8, at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. The sales event will run for a full 96 hours, ending on July 12 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET.</p><p>That said, Amazon offers early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to Prime Day every year. And depending on sale plans from other retailers, Prime Day-esque deals will likely be available on Monday, July 7, or even the weekend prior to the event. Amazon has a tendency to match competitors in the gaming, tech, and entertainment spaces.</p><hr><h2>Prime Day 2025 Deals: What to Expect</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463"></a><figcaption>Amazon Prime Day 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg"></figure><p>So, Prime Day 2025 is twice as long, does that mean twice as many deals? Probably not, no. It's more likely that the lengthened window just gives customers more time to shop. It also formalizes what has, in practice, been true for years at this point: Amazon Prime Day was already a week-long sales event.</p><p>Not officially, but with the plethora of early deals and so-called "anti-Prime Day" sales from competing retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, the annual summer sale has become Black Friday in July over the past few years.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime Day 2025 Early Deals</a></h2><p>Amazon has already started offering some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">early deals for Prime members</a>. Official early Prime Day deals, just like deals during the event, are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a>. Amazon Prime costs $15/month or $139 per year. New subscribers can get a 30-day trial that can be canceled at any time. Young adults (ages 18-24) and students can subscribe for $7.49/month, and if you're new to Prime, the no-cost trial is extended to six months.</p><hr><p>Prime Day is generally the best time of the year to buy many Amazon-branded electronics, including Fire TV Sticks, Echo Dots, and Kindle ereaders. Amazon's early deals frequently include these devices and others. For instance, Amazon already has an awesome deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> that drops the price to only $20. Fire TV Stick deals are currently available to non-Prime members, but the various 4K Amazon Fire Smart TVs that are on sale are exclusive to members. Here's a quick look at some notable Amazon device deals.</p><ul><li><strong>Amazon Streaming Device Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> -- $20 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube 4K</a> -- $100 (<del>$140</del>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Amazon Fire Smart TV Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">32" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $110 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-32-inch-2-series-hd-smart-tv/dp/B0CJCYMBZJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">40" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $170 (<del>$250</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0B3GTSQ9Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">50" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $280 (<del>$450</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$460</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$550</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6ZRH6C?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $365 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B0BJMGB9RN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">65" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $450 (<del>$720</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $570 (<del>$1,100</del>)</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>Prime Day Gaming Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg"></figure><p>As part of its early <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B07P989QTJ,B08KT9XY9Z,B0B2BZWGRK&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day gaming deals</a>, Amazon is selling its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna Wireless Controller for only $40 (was $70)</a>. Though initially designed with Luna cloud gaming in mind, this Bluetooth controller is a pretty great gamepad for general use on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. It's reminiscent of the Switch Pro Controller (the first one). You can also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KT9XY9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundle the Luna Controller with a phone clip</a> for mobile gaming for $50.

The freebies, which can be redeemed at the Epic Games Store, GOG, Microsoft Store, Amazon's own Games App, and other digital storefronts, are arguably worth the price of a membership alone.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to Prime Day, Amazon typically gives away even more free games on top of the monthly offers. That's the case this year, too. Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, Prime members can claim six free PC games, five of which are DRM-free GOG games.</p><p>Here's the full list of freebies going live today, but Prime members should also make sure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/" data-ref-id="1100-6531806">claim the monthly free games for June</a>, too.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Game</th><th scope="col">Unlock time</th><th scope="col">Storefront/License</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>Amazon Games App</td></tr><tr><td>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row 2</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>TOEM</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Rebellion</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2>Can I still get deals without Amazon Prime?</h2><p><em>Technically</em>, Prime Day deals are exclusive to members. In practice, however, there are <em>many </em>deals each year that don't require a membership. These deals are mainly the ones Amazon is price-matching to compete with Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other major retailers. These sorts of deals are fairly common for gaming and tech products, but there are still thousands of deals that are locked behind the membership each year.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>   </ul> </div>
