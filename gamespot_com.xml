When bored aliens transform Earth into a giant video-game style dungeon, Coast Guard veteran Carl becomes a participant in a life-or-death tournament. Carl is accompanied by a cat named Princess Donut. Throughout the series, the duo squares off against a wide array of monsters and solves puzzles. In case the name Princess Donut didn't give it away, Dungeon Crawler Carl doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the high stakes, the series frequently leans into the ridiculousness of the scenario with darkly humorous dialogue and over-the-top violence.</p><p>You can start your journey with Carl and Princess Donut by picking up the hardcover edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeon Crawler Carl (Book 1)</a> for $20.30 (was $30) at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">The upcoming hardcover editions follow the same release schedule as the first three novels: Ace is publishing one hardcover per month for the next three months. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593955978?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book 4)</a></strong> releases March 11 and is available to preorder for $25 (was $30) at Amazon. You can save even more on Book 5, as preorders for <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593955994?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Butcher's Masquerade</a></strong> are discounted to $20.49 (was $35) ahead of its April 8 release. Book 6, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059395601X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Eye of the Bedlam Bride</a></strong>, will be published in hardcover on May 13, and preorders are up for grabs for $34 (was $39).</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering why the retail prices are higher for later books in the series, it's likely related to page count. Books 1 and 2 were 464 and 384 pages, respectively, whereas Book 5 is 720 pages and Book 6 is the longest book in the series at 832 pages.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the cover art for all six hardcover editions below.

                <p>The beloved roguelike platformer Spelunky 2 was released in 2020 for PlayStation 4, and a native PS5 version just dropped yesterday, March 6.</p><p>While the PS4 version can back played on PS5 via backwards compatibility, the PS5 version has one crucial upgrade, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/535865/spelunky-2-ps5-ps4-upgrade-120-fps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as noted by Polygon.</a> It can also run at a blazing-fast 120fps, provided that your monitor or TV has the capability to show those frames. Those extra frames could be the difference between victory and defeat in an unforgiving game like Spelunky 2.</p><p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001266" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spelunky 2 costs $20 on PSN</a>. Fortunately, those who already own Spelunky 2 on PS4 can simply upgrade to the PS5 version for free. The game also has cross-play to its online multiplayer functions, so players can join up with others from different platforms.</p><p>Spelunky 2 already had a current-gen version with Xbox Series X|S, and now PS5 has joined that category. The game is also on Nintendo Switch, but it's unknown whether a native Switch 2 version will come, as Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming console has some backwards compatibility restrictions</a>.</p><p>Spelunky 2 revolves around Ana Spelunky, the daughter of Spelunky's protagonist, Guy Spelunky. After her parents go missing, Ana goes on a journey to the moon in order to find them.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spelunky-2-review-snakes-on-a-2d-plane/1900-6417567/" data-ref-id="1900-6417567">Spelunky 2 review</a>, we said, "Spelunky 2 is a successful evolution of what made the original Spelunky work; the tight controls, impressive use of procedural generation, expressive art style, and interesting stage themes are better than ever here."</p>
