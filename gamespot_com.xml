                <p>When it comes to life simulator games, EA's The Sims has largely had the field to itself since its launch 25 years ago. But Krafton's upcoming title, InZoi, looks like it could be a real contender in terms of scale, and it even has more realistic characters than The Sims' cartoonish avatars. Regardless, InZoi director Hyungjun Kim says that he has a great deal of respect for The Sims and doesn't view the two games as being in competition with one another.</p><p>"We see InZoi not as a competitor to The Sims, but rather as another option that fans of this genre can enjoy," said Kim during an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzoi-director-says-we-have-great-respect-for-the-legacy-the-sims-has-built-and-doesnt-see-their-game-as-a-director-competitor-our-aim-is-to-provide-a-different-experience" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "We have great respect for the legacy The Sims has built over the years, since we know that reaching that much depth in such a short period of time is no easy task. This is due to the nature of life sim games which cover the vast and complex concept of 'life,' making it difficult to capture its every aspect."</p><p>Kim went on to note some of the features of InZoi, which set it apart from The Sims. In addition to the realistic style for the characters and the world around them, he said that InZoi has "in-depth customization features, and AI-driven creative tools." Krafton has previously stated that the AI features can allow the avatars to develop personalities and even let players use a picture of furniture to translate an object into a 3D model that can be used in the game.</p><p>InZoi was originally supposed to enter early access in late 2024 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-competitor-inzoi-has-been-delayed-but-it-finally-has-an-official-release-date/1100-6527652/" data-ref-id="1100-6527652">it was pushed back</a> to PC on March 28, with a console release to follow at a later date. During Gamescom, GameSpot was able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-life-sim-inzoi-you-can-crash-cars-ride-rollercosters-and-commune-with-ghosts/1100-6526125/" data-ref-id="1100-6526125">play an in-progress build of InZoi</a> that allowed players to do a wide variety of things, including becoming ghosts after reaching an untimely end. Krafton also previewed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-gamescom-trailer-shows-the-joy-and-pain-of-everyday-life/1100-6525913/" data-ref-id="1100-6525913">the InZoi character studio tool</a> for a limited time on Steam.</p>

                <p>Bungie hasn't been shy about deleting older content from Destiny 2 (a process it calls "vaulting") in order to make room for new stuff, but it appears this controversial practice had some unintended consequences. As part of a lawsuit filed against them, Bungie had to cite fan videos from YouTube, because the content in question is no longer part of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, a sci-fi writer named Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a lawsuit against Bungie last year, alleging that an enemy faction called the Red Legion was plagiarized from the author's WordPress writing. In its response, Bungie dismissed the claims as baseless, but the company's counsel was forced to cite fan YouTube compilations of cutscenes and gameplay from the vaulted original campaign of Destiny 2 in order to make their case. While the publisher would normally be able to simply submit a copy of the game as an exhibit, that's not possible here for obvious reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because (1) Destiny 2's narrative is only available to players in the form of a live-service video game that has changed significantly over time, and (2) physical copies of Destiny 2, and any 2017 version of Destiny 2, are no longer available, the attached videos are the best possible way for the Court to review the accused work," reads the explanation given to the Court in part. In lieu of this, Bungie linked two videos, including a ten hour "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M">complete story of Destiny</a>" compilation from YouTuber My Name is Byf.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been some time since Bungie last vaulted content, although it has progressively reintroduced certain key content, including raids, that were rendered unplayable for an extended period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still no word on the outcome of the lawsuit.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis are finally giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> a burglar of its own in a new update that's live on all platforms. The Sims 4's burglar update coincides with the launch of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-businesses-hobbies-expansion-adds-tattoo-artist-career-and-ceramic-incense-burners/1100-6529300/" data-ref-id="1100-6529300">Businesses and Hobbies expansion</a>, though you don't have to buy the new pack to get the burglar. It's a free update for the base game with special interactions if you own certain other expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Maxis included a burglar in The Sims, The Sims 2, and The Sims 3, but never in The Sims 4 until now. Robin Banks, the new version of the criminal mastermind, behaves in much the same way as the burglar in previous iterations. There's a low chance that Robin will enter your residential or business lot at night, and she can potentially make off with anything inside that isn't attached to the structure, such as windows or lights, or that isn't planted in the ground, like your shrubbery. The update also adds a new lot challenge, Heist Havoc, that increases the likelihood of Robin appearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims might wake up, catch Robin, and call the police before she makes off with their property, though there's no guarantee the police will arrive before Robin makes her getaway. Maxis said the only sure way to stop a burglar is to install an alarm, which alerts police as soon as Robin enters the premises. Sims who are good with their hands can upgrade their alarm to keep it from breaking as frequently or even modify it to release an electric charge and stun the burglar. If your Sim is more physically inclined, they can also pick a fight with Robin, though they might lose if they aren't in good shape.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wnGkiBOtM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_wnGkiBOtM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of other Sims 4 expansions include unique interactions for the burglar. For example, if you own the Cats and Dogs pack and have a dog in your house, they might chase Robin out. Vampire Sims can turn Robin into a thrall and command her to leave, while scientists from the Get to Work pack can use a freeze ray to stop Robin. Non-playable Sims, such as Agnes Crumplebottom in the Cottage Living pack, will have their own methods for dealing with Robin.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Maxis said The Sims 4 treats Robin like other special NPCs. You can make friends with her and add her to your household, and if she moves in with you or dies, another, generic burglar will spawn and take up her criminal mantle.</p>
