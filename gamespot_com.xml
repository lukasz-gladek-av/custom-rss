                <p>I prefer to play my games without mods or console commands to get as close to the intended experience as possible. But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Console Commands</h3><p dir="ltr">Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Cheats</h3><p dir="ltr">We have a full list of Console and Debug commands further down, but we would be remiss in not mentioning our favorite command: Cheats.</p><p dir="ltr">For Cheats to work, you'll need to download and install the <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/SML" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)</a>, with additional information in the <a href="https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/SMLChatCommands.html" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Modding Documentation</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of our favorite Cheats include: NoPower, NoCost, TurboProductionMode, and Teleport. NoPower still requires that you wire up your machines, but you don't have to actually power them. NoCost makes machines and the like free to place. TurboProductionMode turns crafting at the bench into an instantaneous affair. Finally, Teleport puts you wherever you like on the map, which is great for when you manage to get yourself into a precarious position between a big drop and some predators who haven't noticed you just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Below, you'll find listings for all console, debug, and cheat commands, per the Satisfactory Modding Documentation page and the <a href="https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Console" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki</a> on Fandom.</p><h3 dir="ltr">All Console, Debug, and Cheat commands</h3><p>Console Commands</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>?

No range limit. Be careful of teleporting outside of the map by accident.</td></tr><tr><td>God</td><td>Toggles god mode, making you immune to damage.</td></tr><tr><td>CheatScript &lt;ScriptName, string&gt;</td><td>Executes commands listed in CheatScript.ScriptName ini section of DefaultGame.ini</td></tr><tr><td>NoMessages &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Disables ADA messages on unlocks.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveAvailableSchematics</td><td>Gives access to all currently purchaseable schematics in the game (including modded ones). It’s recommended that you run NoMessages true first.</td></tr><tr><td>ResetGamePhases</td><td>Resets your space elevator progress. Does not affect unlocked milestones.</td></tr><tr><td>SetNextGamePhase</td><td>Completes the next available space elevator tier. Does not grant any milestones.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveSchematicsOfTier &lt;int, tier number in HUB&gt;</td><td>Unlocks all milestones in the specified tier number. It’s recommended that you run NoMessages true first.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveActiveMilestoneSchematic</td><td>Immediately completes the selected milestone in the HUB.</td></tr><tr><td>CompleteResearch</td><td>Immediately completes ongoing MAM research.</td></tr><tr><td>NoCost &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables or disables the NoCost cheat, which is saved in the save file, and persists even when mods are uninstalled. When enabled, no items are required to build things with the build gun. Crafting stations still require ingredients.</td></tr><tr><td>NoPower &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables or disables the NoPower cheat, which is saved in the save file, and persists even when mods are uninstalled. When enabled, buildings still require a power connection, but they require no electricity to run. Vehicles also do not require fuel.</td></tr><tr><td>TurboProductionMode &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>When enabled, all items craft instantly in the workbench and workshop. Buildings are unaffected.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemStacks &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Stacks&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of full stacks of an item to the player’s inventory. If the inventory isn’t big enough to hold it all, extra slots will be granted as well. You can find an item’s Blueprint Path on the Satisfactory Wiki, finding the content on a reference list, or via searching around for it in FModel. You can also use it to give yourself additional inventory slots via GiveItemStacks "" numberOfSlots</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemsSingle &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Items&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of individual items to the player’s inventory. Unlike GiveItemStacks, if the inventory can’t hold the items, the inventory will NOT be expanded. You can find an item’s Blueprint Path on the Satisfactory Wiki, finding the content on a reference list, or via searching around for it in FModel.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveResourceSinkCoupons &lt;Amount&gt;</td><td>Adds AWESOME Sink coupons to the pool that can be printed at an AWESOME Sink. Does not affect how many points it takes to earn the next coupon.</td></tr><tr><td>Slomo &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Speeds up or slows down the entire game by the given multiplier. This includes player movement, particles, animations, etc. It has an effect on building operation rate, but not as pronounced as one may expect. For example, 10.0 makes Copper Sheets craft in around 3.5 seconds instead of the 6 seconds they take at 1.0.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeOfDay &lt;Hour&gt; &lt;Minute&gt;</td><td>Sets the world time of day in 24 hour time format.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeSpeedMultiplier &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Sets a world time of day speed multiplier. Set it to 0 to freeze the day/night cycle altogether.</td></tr><tr><td>EnableBuildableTick &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables/disables AFGBuildable ticking, which controls if buildings are animated.

If you’re upright already, it will flip you upside down.</td></tr><tr><td>ResetAllFactoryLegsToZero &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Makes the support legs on all buildings reset to their default height. The boolean argument controls if it should "repopulateEmptyLegs," presumably if they were deleted somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>RebuildFactoryLegsOneTileAroundPlayer</td><td>Recalculates the support legs on buildings near the player. If the gap is too large, they will just reset to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>FillAllFreightCars &lt;percent full, float&gt;</td><td>Fills all freight cars in the map with a nameless, descriptionless placeholder item. The argument controls how close to full they are, with 1.0 being 100% Freight cars that already had items in them when this command was run will have the items emptied instead of set to the fill percentage.</td></tr><tr><td>EmptyAllFreightCars</td><td>Empties all freight cars in the map of their contents.</td></tr><tr><td>HideAllBuildings &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Hides or shows all factory buildings. They still have collision.</td></tr><tr><td>ShowFactoryOnly &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Hides or shows all terrain, including the skybox and its light. Disables your flashlight when enabled. It still has collision.</td></tr><tr><td>ForceSpawnCreatures</td><td>Forces active spawners to spawn creatures even if the creature isn’t set to spawn yet (because of day/night restrictions etc.)</td></tr></tbody></table>
