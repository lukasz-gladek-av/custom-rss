This will be particularly pronounced for cost-conscious consumers, Van Dreunen said. The analyst said the Switch 2 is projected to sell for about $400 at launch, which is $100 more than the Switch launched at in 2017. Other analysts have suggested similar price points, while one analyst believes it could <a

a specific unit sales projection for the Switch 2.

A different analyst, meanwhile, is projecting the Switch 2 to have the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-higher-chip-price-could-make-system-500-analyst-says/1100-6530129/" data-ref-id="1100-6530129">biggest console launch in history and sell 20 million units in its first year.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, George Jijiashvili of Omdia told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-wont-outsell-the-original-switch-but-thats-okay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the Switch 2 could sell 14.7 million units through its first calendar year, exceeding the first-year sales of the original Switch. The Switch 2 won't be able to sell as many lifetime units, however, Jijiashvili said. The Switch has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 150 million units</a>, making it the No. 2 best-selling console ever, only behind the PS2.</p><p>Nintendo will further discuss the Switch 2 during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2</a>.

                <p>The last decade alone has seen a major shift in how entertainment is produced and consumed, and while the future isn't set in stone, Avengers: Endgame and The Electric State directors Joe and Anthony Russo have predicted that "linear visual storytelling" is in for a big shake-up once Gen Z becomes the dominant consumers of media. In a new interview, the duo explained how the future of entertainment could be dominated by projects that embrace both gaming and traditional formats to tell a story.</p><p>"We are in the biggest transitional moments in the history of linear visual storytelling," Joe Russo said to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/avengers-doomsday-directors-1236161664/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It's very hard to say in this moment where it’s going because a lot of that is going to be dictated by the taste of Gen Z once they become the dominant consumers. And I don't know that anyone knows what their taste is yet because they have been trained on a completely different model of consumption than we are used to. I expect radical change, I expect immersion, I expect a blending of virtual and linear, gaming and linear."</p><p>The Russos are already experimenting with a two-pronged approach to their projects, as The Electric State has a companion game scheduled to arrive later this month. The directors have also mentioned how they're "open" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-are-open-to-doomsday-and-secret-wars-video-games/1100-6529915/">having video games developed based on their next two Marvel movies</a>, Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars. This also lines up with <a href="https://za.ign.com/joe-russo/162274/news/gaming-will-dominate-the-future-of-storytelling-avengers-endgame-director-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previous comments by Russo</a> about how he believes the future of entertainment will be dominated by gaming.</p><p>Another example of how entertainment is evolving to appeal to Gen Z can be seen in the recent reveal of ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">Disco Elysium re-imagining for mobile</a>. The studio recently revealed how it wants to make the game playable in short bursts, as the game has been redesigned to fit smartphone screens in vertical mode and it has been enhanced with "360-degree scenes" and brand-new audio so that it can feel more immersive.</p>

                <p>Revealed by Konami in 2022, Silent Hill f received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">new cinematic trailer</a> this week--though no release date was announced. Showing off a chilling small town in Japan and its lead protagonist, student Shimizu Hinako, it looks like another terrifying entry in the beloved franchise. If you're excited about the chance to finally dive in, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F1C14LY8,B0F1BXGKR4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are now open at select retailers. Silent Hill f will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC at launch.</p><h2>Silent Hill f Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No official preorder bonuses from Konami have been revealed yet, though an announcement is likely arriving at a later date. Keep in mind that most retailers don’t make you pay for your item until it ships--so you're free to preorder now, then swap up your choice if there's a retailer-exclusive bonus that catches your eye.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 14, 2025. Below, we take a look at how the unusual platformer had a spark unlike anything else in the series.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When fans think of the Donkey Kong series' platforming games, it's easy to consider the timeline as one that began with Rare and its groundbreaking CG graphics in the SNES era before the baton was eventually picked up by Retro Studios with Donkey Kong Country Returns. In Nintendo's history of wacky and inventive ways to play games, there is perhaps nothing quite as bizarre as Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, released in North America in 2005 for GameCube, which gave the iconic ape a stopgap to remember in between the Rare and Retro eras.</p><p dir="ltr">The credit can't all go to the Kyoto company though, quite literally so because this was in fact the debut of its newly established EAD (Entertainment, Analysis and Development) Tokyo studio designed to attract new talent from Japan's capital. Even the technology that's front-and-center in Donkey Kong Jungle Beat wasn't created by Nintendo but rather Namco in its 2003 music spin-off Donkey Konga.</p><p dir="ltr">The DK Bongos felt like a natural extension of drumming in its popular Taiko no Tatsujin series. While a microphone also detects hand claps, it otherwise follows rhythm game conventions of tapping the drums of clapping in time to notes on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Call it another example of lateral thinking, but the strange minds at EAD Tokyo, led by Super Mario Sunshine co-director Yoshiaki Koizumi, somehow came up with an unconventional way of using this controller, all while taking Donkey Kong back to his side-scrolling fundamentals.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather divisively, Jungle Beat eschews many of the staples from the Donkey Kong Country series--no rolling jumps, no collectible jigsaw pieces or KONG letters, not even Diddy Kong--in favor of a simple story where DK goes through different kingdoms battling evil kings from across the animal kingdom in a bid to come out as the top banana.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw0F8_zz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6dw0F8_zz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The stripped-back approach was in service of the simpler controls. Beating the left or right drum individually makes DK move in that corresponding direction--rapidly to make him move faster, while beating both together makes him jump. Meanwhile, clapping your hands sends out a shockwave that stuns enemies caught in the radius, collects nearby bananas, and interacts with objects like vines and catapults. Helpfully, this also mitigates the need for exact precision.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game garnered some criticism over being more simplistic and lacking in the secrets and challenge of the Country series, Jungle Beat is anything but easy. What makes it replayable is its score-attack system. Rather than just getting to the end of a level, it's about earning as many bananas as possible, and the way to get more bananas is by earning more beats. For instance, you could just walk and jump to collect the bananas onscreen, but if you clap, the shockwave collects them all around you instantly, which in turn increases your beat score.</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating enemies and interacting with objects also gains beats, but the real trick is performing all these actions together while airborne, which builds up a combo. The higher the combo, the more beats and bananas you get--one way of gaining more beats is not from bananas but flowers. At the end of each kingdom, your banana total also determines your rank, where you're awarded a crest for bronze, silver and gold, which is important as it's also how you unlock more levels in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than a world map made of different levels that culminate in a boss fight, each kingdom is made up of two levels and a boss battle, which have to be completed before you're scored. However, you can't collect any more bananas during the boss battles, some which include rival Kongs that take the form of one-on-one brawls where you have to avoid a punch at the right time before bashing the drums for a counter.</p><p dir="ltr">It then ups the stakes, as you try to avoid getting hit, which causes you to lose bananas, which also counts as your health. Having hundreds means the game is incredibly generous when it comes to life, but there's nothing worse than having racked up over 800 bananas (the number required for a gold crest in the first two stages) only to mess up against the boss and drop a rank.</p><p dir="ltr">While this simple control scheme still allows for some interesting maneuvers like backflips and wall jumps, the execution isn't without its flaws. Even if the instruction manual warns that the bongos are highly sensitive, in the heat of playing Jungle Beat, it's all too easy to beat the drums so hard (especially when it feels like a beat hasn't been registered) that the microphone mistakes it for a clap instead, while even a brief session is likely to leave your palms sore from so much clapping. But even though you can technically play with a regular GameCube controller, and some would argue using the C-stick triggers shockwaves with more precision than hand claps, that would also largely rob the game of its unique charm.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, Jungle Beat might be more of a curio before Retro picked up the baton years later, while EAD Tokyo arguably went on to far greater feats, its next project being all-time classic Super Mario Galaxy. Yet with its design to make a more approachable game that could appeal to more players with a unique control scheme, you can see that kind of thinking as a precursor to the Wii's philosophy. It did receive a Wii port sans bongos. And while it may not have resulted in a sequel, I can't help but think that it was influential in its own way. I wouldn't be surprised if the streamers who beat Dark Souls with a dance mat or a banana hadn't come across Jungle Beat first.</p><p dir="ltr">With Retro focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4</a>, there's been speculation that Nintendo is once again internally developing a new Donkey Kong game, which would make sense following the opening of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-will-join-universal-studios-japan-in-spring-2024/1100-6519697/" data-ref-id="1100-6519697">Donkey Kong Country area in Universal Studios' Super Nintendo World.</a> Whatever the future holds, I can only hope that it contains ideas even a fraction as bananas as Jungle Beat's.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has announced a crystal-shattering sales milestone for the Final Fantasy franchise. Worldwide, the RPG series has now topped 200 million copies sold, with the achievement apparently coinciding with the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series surpassing 5 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Final Fantasy account <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> shared the Ifrit-sized accomplishment for the series. The post also thanks players for "wherever you joined us on our adventures." The RPG franchise began in 1987 with the original Final Fantasy, with the most recent mainline addition being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy XVI</a> in 2023. Last year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the remake made its way to PC at the beginning of this year. In fact, the game starring Cloud Strife and crew <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-a-new-record-for-the-longtime-series/1100-6529033/">set a Steam concurrent-players record for the series</a>. The PC release has also led to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1">one of 2025's best-selling games so far</a>. It's an intriguing development after Square Enix noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI failed to meet sales expectations</a> in September.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!<br>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series--consisting of the first six mainline games in the franchise--originally launched on PC and mobile devices in 2021. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection-is-coming-to-consoles-on-april-19/1100-6513014/">Square Enix then brought the Pixel Remaster series to Switch and PS4</a> in April 2023, with an Xbox Series X|S release happening in 2024. Speaking of Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xivs-full-xbox-release-date-confirmed-alongside-free-game-pass-expansions/1100-6521644/">Final Fantasy XIV finally arrived on Xbox Series X|S</a> last year, too. The MMO's success has actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-will-bring-more-games-to-xbox-after-final-fantasy-14s-success/1100-6526160/" data-ref-id="1100-6526160">led to Square Enix promising more of its games for Xbox</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy franchise hitting 200 million copies sold puts it in rarefied air. For example, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/#20">Capcom revealed that the company's best-selling franchise is Resident Evil</a> with 176 million copies sold, followed by Monster Hunter with 108 million. Meanwhile, Call of Duty is in a whole other stratosphere with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/">the FPS franchise passing 500 million copies sold</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/">Pokemon series, which has sold 99 million units on Switch alone</a>.</p>
