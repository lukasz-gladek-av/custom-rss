                <p>The worlds of Silent Hill and Castlevania have crossed over with Dead by Daylight before, but the latest collaboration between Konami and Behaviour Interactive is taking things even further into The Fog. This time, Silent Hill's Pyramid Head and Castlevania's Dracula are teaming up as The Executioner and The Dark Lord. And they aren't the only guest characters in this 2v8 battle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoxhwNgPaGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoxhwNgPaGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dead by Daylight's Silent Hill X Castlevania collaboration starts today, November 6, and extends through November 20. Both of the series' respective villains will be joined by a pair of returning heroes: Silent Hill 3's Cheryl Mason and Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. All four characters are available for free during the 2v8 battles for the duration of this event.</p><p>There are also four new outfits--one for each of the returning characters. Trevor's Legendary Outfit essentially transforms him into his descendant, Richter Belmont. Dracula's alternate look is called the Scorched Terror Outfit. Basically, it's what Dracula looks like when he's left in the sun long enough for his skin to blister and peel.</p><p>Cheryl's alternate look is the Awakened Order outfit, which features her as she "embraces a sinister ritual." As for Pyramid Head, he's a glutton for punishment with his Flayed Torturer outfit, which is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Earlier this year, Dead by Daylight had crossover collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-walking-dead-heroes-are-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/1100-6533018/" data-ref-id="1100-6533018">The Walking Dead's heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-hits-new-player-count-record-with-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover/1100-6532544/" data-ref-id="1100-6532544">Five Nights At Freddy's murderous animatronics</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evils-greatest-monsters-unite-in-first-look-at-new-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/1100-6529360/" data-ref-id="1100-6529360">Resident Evil characters</a>. Knowing this game, there are almost certainly more crossovers coming after this one.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced a big new addition to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-price-free-games-and-all-the-other-perks-you-get-with-a-membership/1100-6530905/" data-ref-id="1100-6530905">GTA+ subscription service</a>. As of today, GTA 5's multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is included with the membership on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it was free on PS5 for a period of time. Now, however, it costs $20 on its own.</p><p>GTA+ costs $8/month, and there is no annual plan. The subscription service is available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but GTA Online is not included with GTA+ on PC, only console.</p><p>One of the perks of GTA+ is access to a library of Rockstar games, and GTA Online is just the latest. The others include GTA: Vice City - The Definitive Edition, GTA 3 - The Definitive Edition, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, GTA: Liberty City Stories, and GTA: Chinatown Wars. These games are playable as long as your subscription remains active.</p><p>Beyond access to games, GTA+ gives members an in-game cash infusion of GTA$ 500,000 each billing cycle, access to in-game discounts, exclusive in-game vehicles, and special perks in GTA Online like a 100-car garage and a member-only app.</p><p>It remains to be seen what will happen with GTA Online and GTA+ when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> arrives in 2026. As of yet, Rockstar has not announced a multiplayer mode for GTA 6, but given the runaway success of GTA Online, it's as close to a sure thing as possible that GTA 6 will incorporate a multiplayer mode.</p><p>Rockstar Games has been in the news lately after the company fired dozens of workers, saying they leaked company secrets. A labor union, however, says they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">laid off for attempting to organize.</a></p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two will release its latest earnings report and answer questions from analysts today, November 6, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Playing NBA 2K26 might be a way for some NBA players to unwind, but Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell utilized the game another way. The six-time All-Star was motivated to put up 46 points on November 5 after he said "this kid pissed me off" while playing the basketball game online earlier in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with 46 points, Mitchell had eight assists and four rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers. When asked about the performance, he noted taking inspiration from an online multiplayer encounter in NBA 2K26, according to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-donovan-mitchell-motivation-video-game-heckler-46-point-night/">CBS Sports</a>. "This kid pissed me off today, I was playing 2K," said Mitchell.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had been playing 2K for like two hours and I told him, too, I said, 'Just wait.' He called me washed up, he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn't seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, 'Alright, we'll see.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Mitchell ended the story by stating that his 46-point performance "was for that kid or grown man" and that he appreciates "whoever that was" in the video game. On the flip side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfls-baltimore-ravens-lose-locker-room-video-games-after-tough-start/1100-6535637/">video games were removed from the NFL's Baltimore Ravens locker room</a> after the team got off to a bad start to the season. They were cited as a distraction for the players, along with a ping pong table and basketball hoop.</p><p dir="ltr">NBA 2K26 released on September 5 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Square Enix unveiled a bold strategy that could have far-reaching implications for the games industry, as the Japanese publisher aims to use generative AI to automate 70% of game QA and debugging by 2027.</p><p>After releasing its financial results, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a progress report</a> on the company's medium-term business plan. On page five of the 20-page presentation, Square Enix announced a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo to research ways of "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies."</p><p>Titled "Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology Using Generative AI," the project features a research team of more than 10 members from both the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory and Square Enix. The goal is to "automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" by using automation technology to improve QA efficiency and operations. Through this R&amp;D, Square Enix hopes to "establish a competitive advantage in game development."</p><p>AI has become a hotly contested topic in games and beyond. Many developers and publishers have mixed opinions on the technology, with some saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">it should be embraced</a> and others claiming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">it poses legal risks</a>. It's not used everywhere; Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">won't use generative AI</a> despite its publisher, Krafton Inc., <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">going all in on the technology</a>. However, it's still being pushed onto developers, with EA wanting its employees to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">think of AI as a "thought partner"</a> while training it on their work.</p>

Series X|S and PC, but that's not all. Microsoft is bringing the game to PlayStation for the first time, and fans on Sony's system don't have to wait. Halo: Campaign Evolved will debut day and date on PS5 with the other versions in 2026. There were rumors and rumbling of Halo on Switch 2, but Microsoft has not yet made any announcements about that.</p><h2 id="Game_Pass">Game Pass</h2><p>Like all of Microsoft's other first-party games, Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch into Xbox Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_guns_and_prequel_missions"><strong>New guns and prequel missions</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There are nine new weapons coming to the Halo: CE remake, including the energy sword, which was equipped by enemies in the original version but couldn't be used by the player. As for the new missions, these are prequel missions featuring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a "brand-new arc" that takes place before the events of the story you already know.</p><p dir="ltr">Another significant update is that players can hijack enemy vehicles and drive the Wraith--this was not possible in the original version of the game, and was introduced in Halo 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also look forward to a "campaign remix" feature that allows players to take on any missions they want with a series of modifiers, or Skulls, to alter the experience with things like random weapons and enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">On the social side, the Halo: CE remake includes two-player split-screen co-op on console (not available on PC) or four-player online co-op. There is cross-play support and shared progressions between console and PC.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945" data-ratio="0.5607476635514" data-width="1177" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4597945"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Halo: Campaign Evolved's new visuals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4597945-screenshot2025-11-06at10.01.43%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Sprint"><strong>Sprint</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In what may be a controversial change, the Halo: CE remake includes sprinting, which is something the early Halo games did not have. The lack of sprint is a defining feature of the older Halo games and something that players feel fondly for. Others, however, may be excited about sprinting and bringing the game up to modern standards. Sprint can be disabled if players want to do that.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="_Reborn__visuals"><strong>"Reborn" visuals</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is promising a suite of updates and upgrades to the classic game. The company claims <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-has-every-asset-getting-attention/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">"every asset"</a> from the original was improved upon for the remake.</p><p dir="ltr">"Battle through the original missions, newly rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding, refined to keep the pace moving without losing the wonder, tension, or heroism of the original," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios promises that the game’s environments have been "reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations." The soundtrack, too, has been remastered, with Halo Studios promising "greater immersion." The primary cast, presumably including Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) is back, and they recorded new lines for the remake.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Unreal_Engine_5"><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong></h2><p>After building Halo: Infinite with a proprietary engine called Slipspace, the developers at Halo Studios shifted to Unreal Engine 5 for future Halo titles, including Halo: Campaign Evolved. This was largely seen as a positive, as the old engine had legacy code that was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-could-be-making-the-jump-from-slipspace-to-unreal-engine-report/1100-6507973/" data-ref-id="1100-6507973">added more complexity for developers</a>. Switching to Unreal Engine 5 was also seen as a positive for recruitment, as Epic's engine is one of the most widely used in the video game industry.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_everyone_likes_the_changes"><strong>Not everyone likes the changes</strong></h2><p>While Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is a big believer in the Halo: Campaign Evolved package and said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">the game warms his heart</a>, another original developer has some reservations. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Jaime Griesemer blasted some of the changes.</a></p><p>Griesemer lamented the trailer's sequence where the Warthog vehicle moved past obstacles that were placed in its path to prevent players from being able "to steamroll the Hunters." "When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters," Griesemer said. "But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame."</p><h2 id="AI_">AI?</h2><p>Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technologies and systems, so many wondered if the company used AI or generative AI on Halo: Campaign Evolved. The company has neither confirmed nor denied this, but said its staffers were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">not <em>required</em> to use genAI for Halo: Campaign Evolved.</a></p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," Microsoft said.</p><p>Executive producer Damon Conn and Game director Greg Hermann spoke about the development of Halo: Campaign Evolved. When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p><p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, saying that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><h2 id="No_multiplayer">No multiplayer</h2><p>As stated, Halo: Campaign Evolved has no multiplayer support beyond the online and local co-op for the campaign. There is no head-to-head multiplayer. If players want that, they can boot up Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which includes multiplayer support for a range of titles, including Halo: Combat Evolved. The game is not available on PlayStation, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_the_first_remake_and_maybe_not_the_last"><strong>Not the first remake and maybe not the last</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Microsoft released a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved back in 2011 Xbox 360 via Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. The game featured updated graphics and online multiplayer support for head-to-head matches, while it also gave players the ability to toggle between old and new graphics with the press of a button.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is included with Halo: The Master Chief Collection, a compilation package featuring six Halo games. In addition to the anniversary edition of the first Halo game, the package includes Halo 2: Anniversary as well, with campaign and multiplayer support.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a leaker, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-2-and-3-are-also-getting-campaign-evolved-style-remakes-leaker-claims/1100-6535856/" data-ref-id="1100-6535856">Halo 2 and Halo 3 are also set to receive campaign-only remakes</a> sometime in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_the_only_new_Halo_game"><strong>Not the only new Halo game</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In addition to Halo: Campaign Evolved, Microsoft is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/">new live-service Halo game</a>. Microsoft previously that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, so it may just be a matter of time before Microsoft officially announces the next game to follow Halo: Infinite. That game, released in 2021, was not the success that Microsoft envisioned, and developer Halo Studios underwent a major reorganization after it released.</p>
