                <p>The daily Treasure Hunter has been a part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape/" data-ref-id="5000-5022">Runescape</a> since 2014, and some of the game's players openly resent it as a pay-to-win feature that diminishes the experience for fans who don't utilize it. Jagex has been exploring its options for the feature, and now the developer is leaving Treasure Hunter's fate in the hands of the fans.</p><p>Jagex has started <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=poll/treasure-hunter-poll" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an online poll</a> that will determine if Treasure Hunter will stay in Runescape. If 100,000 players vote to remove Treasure Hunter, it will be completely deleted from the game alongside 225 direct XP and skilling items that are related to it. That would leave the game with only two purchasable items: Bonus XP with capped storable limits per skill and cosmetics "with a more grounded visual identity."</p><p>"Today marks one of the most important moments in Runescape history," reads a statement on the site. "We are proposing a new future for the game led by integrity, where your achievements are based on merit, and the vast experiences offered within Gielinor can truly shine.This is an era-defining shift for Runescape where YOU will cast the deciding vote--just as we did for the birth of Old School."</p><p>Jagex has previously laid out <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/mtx-experiments-what-weve-learned" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the results of its experiments with Treasure Hunter</a>, and earlier polling that indicated it was a valuable resource for "time-poor" players. To appeal to those players, Bonus XP will remain in the store, but the new skill caps for storable XP are meant to encourage players to engage in the regular gameplay rather than simply buying all of their experience.</p><p>If the vote goes forward to remove Treasure Hunter, Jagex stated that it will "invest in a year-long Integrity Roadmap that addresses the heart of issues that have long held Runescape back--from UI, to onboarding, to dailyscape, revisiting the combat status quo and beyond. We'll also be looking at the balance of our XP progression too, ensuring each skill is still a satisfying experience to level up with a significant reduction in MTX-relative skilling items."</p><p>To place a vote, players will have to be logged in as their Runescape characters. The voting period will run until November 12, and nearly 40,000 players have already voted in favor of removing Treasure Hunter.</p><p>Outside of the main game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/old-school-runescape/" data-ref-id="5000-486787">Old School Runescape</a> recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-ref-id="1100-6533697">broke its concurrent-user record</a> with 241,016 players.</p>
