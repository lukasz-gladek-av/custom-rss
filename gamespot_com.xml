                <p>Vampire Survivors has spawned a wave of games inspired by it in the years since it was first released, and Warhammer Survivors is the next game set in this genre of endless hordes and power-ups. Featuring characters and weapons from both Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Survivors is a co-production between Auroch Digital and Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, using the same engine that powers the roguelite survivors game it's inspired by. It's scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5E_EaxN1qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like Vampire Survivors, the focus will be on taking down waves of enemies, powering up your character, and evolving your weapons. You can choose to play in the sci-fi world of Warhammer 40K or the fantasy realm of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, and the roster includes characters like Malum Caedo, Neave Blacktalon, and more.</p><p>As for the weapons, Auroch Digital says you can expect favorites like the Astartes chainsword, whirlwind axes, and Bolter gun, and once combined with certain power-ups, players will be able to clear the screen of any heretics.</p><p>This is just one of several Warhammer 40K games in development, as fans of the franchise can also look forward <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-coming-next-year-to-pc/1100-6534085/" data-ref-id="1100-6534085">Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 4</a> on PC next year.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced-very-unexpected-spin-off-out-now/1100-6531732/" data-ref-id="1100-6531732"> Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a> was officially revealed in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/" data-ref-id="1100-6530114">Space Marine 3 is in development</a>, and Rogue Trader studio Owlcat Games is working on a new CRPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">called Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

                <p>You might think that your weapons or gear or inventory items are the most important elements of your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> account, but the answer is, actually, your pet chicken. At the start of Arc Raiders, you'll be gifted Scrappy, a chicken that can collect resources for you while you're out killing enemies during a drop. To make Scrappy even stronger, it can be upgraded to be even better at its job.</p><p>Like all <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-upgrade-weapons-and-workbenches-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535890/" data-ref-id="1100-6535890">upgrades in Arc Raiders</a>, Scrappy requires some specific resources every time you go to advance its level. If you want to progress Scrappy to level three, you'll need to acquire three lemons and three apricots. While this might sound like a trivial task, just wait until you learn how rare lemons and apricots can be in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Lemon and apricot locations in Arc Raiders</h2><p>In general, you'll be able to loot lemons and apricots on the ground at the base of trees. However, you can also kick some trees to get fruit to fall onto the ground, which you can then scoop up. Consider that a bonus addition to our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>. The number of available trees during a drop wildly varies in Arc Raiders, and this includes trees that you both can and can't shake. Both lemons and apricots are "green" loot items, so they tend to stick out more than more common loot you find on the ground.</p><p>When you drop into a match, you should initially look for the "Nature" icon on your map. These areas generally have the highest chances of spawning trees, but again, this isn't guaranteed. You could also find trees in these areas, but there won't be any lemons or apricots on the ground (both before and after you kick them).</p><p>If you're looking for the highest chance of finding lemons and apricots in Arc Raiders, you'll want to head to The Blue Gate map and search around Olive Grove, which is located on the southern side of the map, just below the Checkpoint. Usually, there are a fair number of trees spread out amongst this area, and most of the time, you'll find either lemons or apricots, and sometimes even both. However, you'll also find a solid number of olives, hence the name of the location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596053-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.19.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596053-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.19.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596053"></a><figcaption>Olive Grove on The Blue Gate map in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596053-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.19.34.png"></figure><p>While Olive Grove isn't an inherently dangerous location on The Blue Gate map, you'll want to keep a vigilant eye out for enemy players who are also searching for lemons and apricots. The Olive Grove has become a hotspot for this very reason, and players who aren't even looking for the fruits will camp out here waiting for players to come along who are trying to upgrade Scrappy.</p><p>For any players who don't want to rely on the tree method for acquiring lemons and apricots in Arc Raiders, there is a secondary way to add the fruits to your inventory. This is by searching baskets on maps, which can be found in most buildings and houses you come across. The Buried City is the best map to find baskets, as they are located in several locations, most notably the Grandioso Apartments and the Santa Maria Houses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596052-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.38.09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596052-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.38.09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4596052"></a><figcaption>Grandioso Apartments on the Buried City map in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4596052-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.11.03-23.28.38.09.png"></figure><p>Finally, to boost your chances of finding lemons and apricots on any map in Arc Raiders, you'll want to keep an eye out for the Lush Blooms event. This event can be hosted at any time, and it provides a flat buff to the number of fruits and other vegetation that spawn on a map. The map the event is hosted on seems to be random, so if you happen to see the event occurring on a map you have unlocked, it's best to hop in and see what you can find.</p>
