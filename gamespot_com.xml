                <p>A recent report said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was at one point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-could-have-shuttered-xbox-prior-to-major-acquisitions-report/1100-6528826/" data-ref-id="1100-6528826">mulling the possibility of shuttering the Xbox division</a>. Before this, Microsoft's own co-founder Paul Allen's investment company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cofounder-s-investment-group-calls-for-xbox-spinoff/1100-6415919/" data-ref-id="1100-6415919">called for Microsoft to dump Xbox and spin it off as a separate business</a>. That never happened, and now Nadella is speaking up to express Microsoft's commitment to gaming. He told <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarkesh Patel</a> that it's not true that Microsoft's investments in gaming is part of some kind of "means to some other end."</p><p>Microsoft has a long history of supporting gaming, Nadella pointed out, referencing how Microsoft Flight Simulator was a Microsoft product before the company even made the first version of Windows.</p><p>"So, gaming has got a long history at the company, and we want to be in gaming for gaming's sake. I always start by saying I hate to be in businesses where they're means to some other end. They have to be ends unto themselves," he said.</p><p>Nadella's comments came in response to a question about if Nadella had some kind of "premonition" about how gaming could help contribute to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Microsoft's push into the artificial intelligence space by using games to train its models. </a></p><p>"We are a company where we have to bring all these assets together and be better owners by adding value. For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge. Ninja Theory has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Muse won't be use to make games</a>, but instead to help empower humans to work faster.</p><p>"I think about gaming data as perhaps, you know, what YouTube is perhaps to Google, gaming data is to Microsoft. And so therefore I'm excited about that," Nadella said.</p><p>AI is a controversial technology within the gaming space and across numerous other businesses. A recent GDC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">study</a> found that the majority of game studios worldwide use generative AI already, despite concerns about the technology. Microsoft itself has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">gone on record saying advancements to AI will lead to job losses</a> in the short term but may lead to more opportunities in the long term. Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 people in the past year in gaming roles, though whether or not the reduction had anything to do with AI is unknown. Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>

                <p>Are you enjoying Avowed? Are you also a fan of growing kits? What about fungus? Well, you're in luck, because Obsidian Entertainment and North Spore have revealed that they're collaborating on a limited-edition <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit?srsltid=AfmBOooM2qgOl4rDGozwQIj3SmWoOhSd9iP1pN-jDoVNk6v6h1a4hGSY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avowed-themed growing kit</a>. It's set to ship out sometime later this month.</p><p>The Organic "Spray &amp; Grow" Avowed Mushroom Growing Kit is modeled after the Dreamthrall Elder Bear, an early-game boss in Avowed. In the game, the Dreamscourge disease has infected the Living Lands, and the bear has succumbed to its primal, savage urges. The infection causes organisms to sprout all over organisms, so a growing kit is certainly a thematically fitting collaboration.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446845,1300-4446844,1300-4446843,1300-4446842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"></figure><p>The kit costs $30 and comes with one of three different mushrooms: blue oyster, pink oyster, or golden oyster--it's a surprise which one you'll get. According to the kit's specifications, it weighs four pounds and takes two weeks to grow. It lasts for six months and while the blue and golden oyster mushrooms can be refrigerated, the pink ones cannot be.</p><p>Xbox is no stranger to themed merchandise of its own games.

                <p>A new Pokemon Presents livestream has been confirmed for February 27 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and pocket monster fans can expect updates on new in-development projects related to the franchise. The Pokemon Company hasn't revealed any details on what will be shown exactly, but fans are expecting to see an update on the next big tentpole game in the franchise, Pokemon Legends Z-A, as well as sneak peeks at other spin-offs in the pipeline.</p><p>The Pokemon Presents livestream has become an annual tradition--these have been held every February since 2021--with additional Pokemon Presents being broadcast closer to big Pokemon game releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> is expected to be the main event, as it's currently scheduled for release on Switch.</p><p>We still have some burning questions for the second entry in the Pokemon Legends series, as so far, we've only seen a brief teaser trailer that heavily hinted at a return to the Kalos region that was introduced in Pokemon X and Y.</p><p>2024 was also an interesting year for the franchise, as no new mainline games or remakes were released. This is the first time since 2015 that the Pokemon series has taken a year off, as in the last decade, developer Game Freak and other studios have consistently pumped out new releases, spin-offs, and expansions.</p><p>The Pokemon Company also has numerous other franchise games that are still active, like Pokemon Go, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket, Pokemon Unite, Pokemon Masters EX, and Pokemon Cafe, to name a few.</p>
