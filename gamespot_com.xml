                <p>Activision has announced what's coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in its upcoming Season 1 update, and there are multiple new melee weapons on the way, including a power drill.</p><p>The two-hit-kill melee weapon is effective at very short range and has a fast attack speed, Activision said. The melee weapon has multiple attack vectors, including sweeps, jabs, uppercuts, and a heavy attack when pressed straight on. "This weapon is ideal for putting a hole in the competition when the going gets tough," Activision said.</p><p>The power drill can be unlocked via en event reward sometime during Season 1, but Activision didn't reveal exactly how it can be unlocked. In any event, the drill itself has 30 levels and mastery badges available, and it can be customized with unique skins. Death by power drill sounds particularly gruesome, but no footage of the drill in action has been released thus far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396577"></a><figcaption>Say hello to the power drill. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg"></figure><p>Another new melee weapon in Black Ops 6 Season 1 is the cleaver. The one-hit-kill melee weapon is effective at short or medium range, Activision said, and it has a medium attack speed. The cleaver can take down multiple enemies at once, and it has a particularly devastating heavy attack. It can be swung side to side or head-on. Whether or not the cleaver can be thrown is unknown but that seems unlikely.</p><p>The cleaver has 30 levels and mastery badges, and can be customized with skins. Like the power drill, the cleaver can be unlocked as an event reward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396578-cleaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396578" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396578-cleaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396578"></a><figcaption>The cleaver comes to Black Ops 6 in Season 1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396578-cleaver.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to these new melee weapons, Season 1 adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-the-replacer-is-becoming-a-playable-operator-in-black-ops-6/1100-6527638/" data-ref-id="1100-6527638">Peter Stormare's The Replacer</a> as a playable operator, as well as new maps, modes, and weapons, along with a new Warzone map, Area 99.

                <p>Mass Effect fans know that November 7 has been designated by BioWare as N7 Day to celebrate the franchise. And while a new Mass Effect game is still likely years away, this year's N7 Day includes some Mass Effect content that you can find in BioWare's latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p><p>There are three items that can be found, all of which reference Commander Shepard from the original Mass Effect trilogy:</p><ul><li>Command Helmet</li><li>Paragon of Leadership</li><li>Specter of Battles Past</li></ul><p>These N7 pieces are just cosmetic, so don't expect the armor to have any stats. The good news is that it's extremely easy to find this free content drop. After players finish The Singing Blade mission within the main quest, the Mass Effect armor will be waiting in a new chest located beside the Caretaker in the Lighthouse. If you've already beaten The Singing Blade and the chest isn't there, exit the game and make sure it's been updated. The chest should be there when you resume play.</p><p>Unfortunately for Dragon Age fans, BioWare recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">The Veilguard won't get any story expansion DLC</a> because the team is now focused on the next Mass Effect game. But if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-streamer-spent-almost-a-whole-day-making-sure-her-rook-was-a-smokeshow/1100-6527593/" data-ref-id="1100-6527593">the numerous create-a-character options in The Veilguard</a> are any indication, Mass Effect's next title will give players even greater control over their character's appearance than before.</p>
