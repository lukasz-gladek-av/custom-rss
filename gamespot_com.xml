                <p>Sony's popular and longrunning professional baseball series, MLB The Show, is expanding to a new place: mobile. A new version of the game "built from the ground up" for mobile is headed to iOS and Android, with a test coming up soon in the Philippines before a global rollout later.</p><p>The regional test for the Philippines begins today, December 3, but there is no word yet on when the game will be available in more places. This kind of limited, regional rollout is common for mobile games.</p><p><a href="https://theshowmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A FAQ</a> for The Show's mobile version confirms it is a standalone game that will not support cross-play with the console editions. The game is optimized for iPhone 16 or "comparable devices" in the Apple family, along with Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V, or "comparable" phones.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a first glimpse at how the pro baseball game is being adapted for mobile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctcq_G3UclA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctcq_G3UclA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The minimum technical specifications can be seen below, and they note that iPads and tablets are not supported. The game's "soft launch" period will allow people to buy in-game currency, Stubs, and unspent Stubs will carry forward to the full release.</p><p>However, unopened purchased packs and player items will not carry over, but will instead be converted into a currency that players can use in the game's "Loyalty Shop" at launch. Additionally, "most progress and content" that players unlock in the game during the soft launch will be wiped.</p><p>For years, MLB The Show was exclusive to Sony's PlayStation family of consoles. But that changed in 2021 when MLB The Show 21 was released on Xbox, in addition to PlayStation. The following year's game, MLB The Show 22, came to Switch in addition to the other console platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-26-announced-with-first-details/1100-6536016/" data-ref-id="1100-6536016">MLB The Show 26 is the newest entry in the series</a> and it's coming in 2026, presumably timed to release around the start of the next MLB season.</p><h2><strong>MLB The Show minimum technical specs for mobile</strong></h2><p><strong>iOS</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: A13</li><li>Minimum RAM: 3GB, Recommended RAM 4 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: iOS 26</li><li>Supported Devices:  <ul><li>iPhone SE 2nd Gen and 3rd Gen</li><li>iPhone 11 and above (iPhone 17 Pro Max)</li></ul></li><li>No iPads</li></ul><p><strong>Android</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9200 (Mali G715)</li><li>Minimum RAM: 4 GB, Recommended RAM 8 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: Android 12 Snow Cone (SDK 31)</li><li>No Tablets</li></ul>
