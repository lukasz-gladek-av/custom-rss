                <p>Sega released a rather interesting trailer for Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It features a brief overview of the beat-'em-up action that the series is known for, as well as a few surprising additions--including a new online multiplayer mode called Red Light Raid. What's most interesting though is the hotline number near the end of the trailer.</p><p>Dialing the number 1-888-YAKUZA0 (1-888-925-8920) will take you to a weird automated system with a variety of options. For instance, it'll ask if you'd like to talk to speak with fan favorite Kazuma Kiryu by pressing 0. Doing so will get you different messages explaining why he can't come to the phone; either he just isn't around or he's in a "bind" because of a murder. The same goes if you try to talk with Goro Majima. That said, the system will still allow you to leave a message for ... someone? There are other options as well. These include placing a takeout order from Smile Burger--a real burger chain that also exists in the game. It won't work of course.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2nhjslX9as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U2nhjslX9as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yakuza 0 was originally released for the PS3/PS4 in Japan back in 2015. Since then, it’s been successfully re-released on various consoles. This marks the first time, however, that Yakuza 0 has been given an upgrade of sorts. Players looking to relive the early days of Kiryu and Majima will be met with new never-before-released cutscenes. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio also added the Red Light Raid, a new four-player cooperative mode. Players will be able to choose from 60 different characters and team up with friends (or randoms via online matchmaking) in hopes of completing challenging missions.</p><p>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will seemingly be the best option for returning fans and newcomers alike. The new cutscenes will offer a deeper look into the lives of its protagonists while the Red Light Raid could be an exciting alternative to the game’s lengthy campaign. For those worried about how much it’ll cost in comparison to other Switch exclusives, don’t: Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will retail for $50 when it releases alongside the Switch 2 on June 5.</p>

                <p>For the last couple of years, one of the go-to options for Xbox Series X|S users looking to expand the storage capacity of their console has been the Expansion Cards sold by Seagate. It looks like the company has a new 4TB memory card on the way, but don't expect it to be cheap. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Seagate+Releases+4TB+Xbox+Expansion+Card+And+It%27s+Very+Expensive&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6531989&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FEEV072&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fseagate-releases-4tb-xbox-expansion-card-and-its-very-expensive%2F1100-6531989%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy did have a listing up for it</a>--possibly too early, since it was quickly taken down--with a price of $430. Seagate hasn't officially confirmed the new Expansion Card yet, but with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Showcase scheduled for June 8</a>, we wouldn't be too surprised to see it formally revealed during the livestream.</p><p>Seagate usually sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB Expansion Cards</a>--the 512GB Expansion Cards seem to have been discontinued for a while now--and like its predecessors, the 4TB Expansion Card is a plug-and-play solution to upgrading your console storage. All you have to do is insert it into the dedicated port at the rear of your Xbox, and you're good to go.</p><h3>Seagate Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $220 (<del>$360</del>)</li></ul><h3>Western Digital Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a> -- $96</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $150</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $250</li></ul><p>Even better, the Expansion Cards are compatible with Xbox's Velocity architecture--so you're still getting lightning-fast load times with your games--and if you have multiple consoles, you can easily transfer data over using this little drive.</p><p>The nice thing about these Expansion Cards is that you're getting <em>most </em>of the listed storage on the box. For example, the 1TB Seagate Expansion Card gives you 920GB of usable space to install games on, and in comparison, a 1TB Xbox Series X console only gives you 802GB of space to work with, as some of it has to be set aside for the system's OS. While we're not certain how much usable space you'll get with the 4TB Expansion Card, it should still be a lot.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Seagate has competition in this space from Western Digital. The company launched its C50 Expansion Card back in 2023, and it offers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB models</a>. Prices have come down substantially since these were first released, as the WD Black 2TB Expansion Card originally sold for $400, but it now retails for $250.</p>

                <p>Players are currently putting the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 through its paces on the game's test server, and they've discovered a new combination of seasonal powers that will make it so every class can teleport a near-infinite amount of times.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">Diablo 4 Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, will let players craft their own spells</a> by combining components like Catalysts, Infusions, and Arcana together. One such spell essentially teleports players to nearby enemies. While that doesn't sound too overpowered on the surface, it's actually a game-changer.</p><p dir="ltr">Using Propulsion as a Catalyst, which generates a large area-of-effect blast, players can then combine it with the Floaty Bobble Arcana to add a teleport effect. Finally, adding in the Bloody Charm Arcana makes it so enemies with less than 20% life hit by the blast are executed and reset the ability.</p><p dir="ltr">That essentially makes it so that as long as there are enemies nearby that will be killed by the blast, players can teleport forever. The spell will be especially powerful for speed-farming activities like Nightmare dungeons or The Pit, where enemies are clustered together. As shown in a video by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNaVLls95NA&amp;t=135s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob2628</a>, the teleport spell becomes even more powerful when paired with a controller and its auto-aiming functionality, which lets players snap to enemies even faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's absolutely crazy how fast you can go with this," Rob2628 says in the video.</p><p dir="ltr">Since this teleport trick is currently only on the Diablo 4 Season 9 public test realm, it's currently unclear if it will make its way into the release version of Season 9 or if Blizzard will adjust Arcana like the Floaty Bobble and Bloody Charm to make the overall spell less powerful. However, nerfing the Arcana that make it possible will also nerf other potential spells players could create, making for a tricky balancing act for Blizzard to walk.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l0bp4w/new_teleport_tech_from_s9_powers_is_going_to/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/season-9s-new-teleport-trick-lets-every-class-speed-farm-in-diablo-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diablo 4 subreddit</a>, at least, don't seem to think the spell will go unchanged, with many top comments making clear that the "fun police" aka Blizzard will put an end to it before Season 9 goes live. For now, players will have to wait and see.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to arrive July 1. The game's currently live <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">Season 8 brought major endgame boss changes</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">limited-time Berserk crossover</a>.
