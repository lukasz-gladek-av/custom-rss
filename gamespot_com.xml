                <p>An update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on launch day makes a couple key changes to the game's shrines, preventing players from destroying certain items in them. The patch comes amid a discussion about cultural sensitivity in the 16th-century Japan game.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to IGN</a>, the update changes the game so that the monks inside of the shrines no longer bleed when attacked, while tables and racks throughout the game's temples and shrines are now indestructible. Bowls and drums can be broken, however, and tables can be moved and pushed.</p><p>Earlier this week, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded to a question about Assassin's Creed Shadows and its shrines. He said, as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, that "defacing a shrine is out of the question--it is an insult to the nation itself. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them."</p><p>Hiroyuki Kada, a Japanese politician, said he fears that if people can vandalize a shrine in Assassin's Creed Shadows, it might "encourage similar behavior in real life."</p><p>"Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided," he said.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/shoheikondo/status/1885391745854173688" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">viral video posted earlier this year</a> showed a player running through a shrine and causing havoc. This was not an objective of any specific quest, but instead the player choosing to do this.</p><p>In July 2024, Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">put out a statement</a> in which it said Shadows is a work of fiction, and one that Ubisoft enlisted the help of external consultants, historians, and researchers as part of an effort to "inform our creative choices." Ubisoft also acknowledged that some of the game's promotional materials at the time "caused concern within the Japanese community," and for that, Ubisoft said, "We sincerely apologize."</p><p>Shadows is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, featuring the protagonists <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-or-naoe-switch-characters/2900-6333/" data-ref-id="2900-6333">Naoe and Yasuke</a>.

As seen below in the side-by-side comparison from <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1902740220245672017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, classic Call of Duty operators stand atop a crashed helicopter in Verdansk, much like the original artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone recently celebrated its fifth anniversary with a nostalgic trailer, and this new promo art further confirms that Season 3 is looking to sell players on nostalgia.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's seasonal artwork usually features key characters and operator skins that players will find in the battle pass or shop bundles. Jason Hudson of the Black Ops series is featured front and center, so he'll likely be the main operator featured in Season 3's battle pass. Hudson was killed off in a flashback during Black Ops 2 that takes place prior to Black Ops 6, so this OG throwback season gives the developer a way of adding the popular character as a playable operator in Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Other notable operators shown in the Season 3 artwork include OG skins for Ghost and Mace from Modern Warfare 2019. Frank Woods is likely getting a throwback skin as well. Frank has been wheelchair-bound since the events of Black Ops 2, but he's standing and looking much younger in Season 3's artwork, so this might be a Black Ops 1 variant skin.</p><p>For more on Call of Duty, make sure to check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-expected-start-date-og-style-rumors-and-leaks-so-far/1100-6529766/">rumors and announcements for Season 3 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.

While no release date has been revealed, there will be a closed beta at a later date. The game will also include microtransactions.</p><p>Not many details about the game were shown off, but Bandai Namco provided information about some of its characters, including who seems to be the protagonist, a black-haired girl named Kanata Honde. The girl with short white hair is named Futre and it seems like she wields some sort of special power, and another girl named Valner Dragnogh. There's also a Digimon named Gemmon, who is a fluffy white creature with gems encrusted into its body, and it looks like it'll be the protagonist's partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHerGig5w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JaoHerGig5w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Pokemon Company found big success with Pokemon TCG Pocket, which is an electronic version of its popular trading card game.
