                <p dir="ltr">No longer are YouTube Playables titles relegated to solo experiences. Google has revealed that it's testing out multiplayer functionality for the free games library, which is found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playables" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube website</a> or in the app.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&amp;msgid=312398093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> is seeing how real-time multiplayer works with two Playables titles: Ludo Club and Magic Tile 3. The former is similar to the Sorry board game and can be played with three other people from around the world. There is even simple chat functionality, such as selecting an angry emoji or saying, "Hello." This new feature works in browsers and on mobile devices, and Google teases there is more stuff on the way for Playables, too.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-is-testing-out-playable-games/1100-6517522/" data-ref-id="1100-6517522">YouTube first rolled out Playables to select users</a> in September 2023. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-introduces-new-playables-game-library/1100-6523785/" data-ref-id="1100-6523785">YouTube formally introduced the Playables games library</a> with over 75 titles for people to play. No downloading is required to check out games like Angry Birds Showdown, Cut the Rope, and Gin Rummy. YouTube will automatically save your progress, meaning you can return to a title wherever you left off.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, this isn't Google's first foray into gaming. In early 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">Google Stadia was officially shut down</a> after an ambitious initiative as a cloud-gaming service. Before that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-is-shutting-down-its-game-studios-impacting-150-people-including-jade-raymond/1100-6486978/" data-ref-id="1100-6486978">Google shut down game studios</a> that it started and acquired to support Stadia.</p>

"Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop," he explained. "That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret."</p><p>Warhammer 40K developer Games Workshop also said in a community update post that the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first project is about to go into full development</a>, starting with its scripts, which will form the foundation for future projects in the universe. The production process for these films and series is expected to take a number of years to develop to fruition.</p><p>The deal between Amazon Prime's Warhammer 40K show and Henry Cavill began in 2022 when Cavill announced his attachment to the project. A year later, Amazon, Games Workshop, and Cavill <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">finally solidified a deal</a>. Now, development is beginning to ramp up, though it's unclear what "Project One" is.</p><p>Amazon's Prime video game anthology series, Secret Level, has dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-space-marine-2-sequel-is-coming-but-it-wont-be-a-video-game/1100-6527310/" data-ref-id="1100-6527310">a new episode today</a> that reveals the events following the ending of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.</p>
