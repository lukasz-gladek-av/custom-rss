That's certainly the case in new clip posted by Rebs Gaming.</p><p>In the sequence, the Battlefield 6 player XxOsiris187xX ejects from a jet high above the battlefield and just as they go to open their parachute, another jet appears below them. The player lands on this jet, walks to the front, dome-shots the pilot, and then gets into the hijacked jet to make a getaway. It's seriously impressive stuff that you need to see to believe--take a look for yourself in the clip below.</p><p>There have been numerous astonishing Battlefield 6 clips that have emerged following the game's big launch on October 10. In another clip, the professional player FaZe Scope uses a drone to vault himself into the sky, then whips out a sniper rifle and takes out a helicopter. Take a look:</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels. It remains to be seen if Battlefield Studios can keep the momentum and engagement going, but the company has seemingly laid a strong foundation to build on. </p><p>Next up for Battlefield 6 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">launch of Season 1 on October 28</a>, and that's also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">the game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch. </a></p><p>As for the competitive landscape, EA veteran Patrick Soderlund's Embark Studios is launching its new multiplayer shooter Arc Raiders on October 30, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14.</a></p>

This is a joke, and yet it's very real at the same time, as seen in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgpXBGbeM4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="68">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SgpXBGbeM4U?start=68" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This isn't just merch," reads the description on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/15/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-couch-panion-sweepstakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. "This isn't just a plush. This is a lifestyle choice. A statement piece. A co-pilot for every late-night quest and awkward snack run. It's satire you can hug--and proof that The Outer Worlds 2 lives beyond the game."</p><p>The Moon Man Couch-Panion is three feet tall and includes a popcorn bucket holder in its head, weird stress-ball squishy hands, and straps designed to hold a TV remote and an Xbox Wireless Controller. It's also got a creepy face that only a nightmare could love. And while these Couch-Panions aren't going to heading to stores, fans will get their chance to win one.</p><p>Starting today and going through November 16, Microsoft is running a contest that will let ten fans receive a Moon Man Couch-Panion of their own. To enter on X, players need to follow <a href="https://x.com/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on the platform</a> and repost <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1978445838452986255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the original Moon Man Couch-Panion contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag. Instagram users can also join in by following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on Instagram</a> and by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/p/DP1LAntkeVg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">commenting on the official contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag before the end of the contest period.</p><p>Microsoft recently unveiled a pair of limited-edition <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-getting-some-pricy-customizable-xbox-controllers/1100-6535316/" data-ref-id="1100-6535316">Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers</a>, which are customizable and more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">shared the launch times</a> earlier this week, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.</p>

                <p>Bleach fans can look forward to a second video game based on the popular manga and anime series, as Crunchyroll has announced Bleach: Soul Resonance. This new dive into the franchise is an action-RPG that features the Bleach cast as playable characters and combat where you directly control their blades. It'll be launching later this year for iOS and Android mobile devices.</p><p>Developer Nuverse says that the game will feature "innovative" swordplay, as players can wield their blades against enemies by moving their fingers across the screen. Wherever your finger goes, the blade follows, and the developer says that each Zanpakuto sword has a unique feel to its design, just like the weapons seen in the anime. Switching between characters will also allow players to pull off powerful combos, and creating a versatile lineup to make the most of character synergies is another key gameplay element.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E19pF5EFbWw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E19pF5EFbWw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, it looks like the roster will include all the characters you'd expect from a Bleach game--from protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki to Soul Society captains like Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki--and pre-registration is now open for Bleach: Soul Resonance. If you'd prefer to play a game set in that universe of Soul Reapers and Hollows, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DP3MVFJC,B0DP3NQZZP&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</a> on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 right now. The fighting game released earlier this year, and unlike your typical 3D arena-fighter anime game, this one features a layered and complex gameplay system that's built around momentum and last-minute comebacks.</p><p>Bleach made a grand return in 2022, and after an extended hiatus, the anime adaptation picked up right where it left off. So far, three seasons of Bleach's final storyline--The Thousand-Year Blood War--have aired, and a fourth season is currently in production.</p>

He said himself and Jen Taylor, the voice actress behind Cortana, are excited to attend the Halo World Championships at the end of the month. "PS: BIG NEWS A'COMIN!!" he said.</p><p>At the end of September, Microsoft reaffirmed plans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-rumors-of-halo-on-ps5-and-switch-2-microsoft-confirms-halo-news-is-coming/1100-6532848/" data-ref-id="1100-6532848">first announced in June</a> to reveal "what we've been working on" during the upcoming Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>Halo Studios said the team will appear on the main stage to "talk about it." There will also be a "deep dive" panel lined up that Halo Studios says "you won't want to miss."</p><p>These events both take place on Friday, October 24. That's all Microsoft had to say--the company did not even specify if it plans to talk about new games or if the announcement could be something else.</p><p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has already confirmed it's working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>, and one of them is said to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744"> remake of the original Halo game for PS5 and Switch 2</a>.</p><p>2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo, and Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">Microsoft could release a new Halo project next year</a> alongside new Fable and Gears of War games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382432" data-ratio="0.55941023417173" data-width="1153" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382432"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress image of Halo made in Unreal Engine 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382433,1300-4382434,1300-4382435,1300-4382436,1300-4382437" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png"></figure><p>It was at 2024's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Project Foundry</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Witchbrook</a>, the highly anticipated life-sim and social RPG from Chucklefish, has officially been delayed to 2026. Originally slated for a Winter 2025 release, the developers announced they’ve made the difficult decision to shift the release into next year, despite strong development progress.</p><p>"Witchbrook is a big project, and it's taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth, and detail," the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer shared</a>, emphasizing its commitment to quality and maintaining a healthy work environment. Chucklefish added that while this approach can extend timelines, it leads to "better games" crafted by "developers who are healthy and well-rested."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWDGCwFZMbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZWDGCwFZMbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Set in the seaside city of Mossport, Witchbrook invites players to enroll at the magical Witchbrook College. As an aspiring witch, you'll uncover a rich world where the familiar and fantastical entwine. Players can expect to build lasting friendships, explore mystical environments, discover forgotten secrets, and even find love, all while learning to harness magic.</p><p>"We wanted to create a living, breathing world for you to explore," Chucklefish continued, and how it wanted a game full of "spellbinding stories, captivating quests, and enchanting systems."</p><p>To showcase the scale of the experience, the team also revealed the first look at the Map of Mossport, highlighting just how expansive the game world is. Every colored area on the map is fully playable--from the trails of Shadhollow Forest to the shores of Parasol Sands. The bustling Mossport High Street offers festivals and markets, while the Student Village hums with youthful energy.</p><p>The team promises more updates soon, including a deep dive into character customization and a new issue of The Witchbrook Oracle. Until then, Chucklefish and its co-developers at Robotality invite fans to get ready for the magic: "We can't wait to share more. Welcome to Mossport!"</p><p>Looking ahead, the extra development time has opened doors to exciting new opportunities, including support for additional platforms and languages. Witchbrook is now planned for release on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, with more platforms to be confirmed.</p>
