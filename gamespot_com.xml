                <p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">WWE 2K25</a> features a Showcase mode that will let fans relive the past by taking part in several legendary matches. Essentially an interactive documentary--and hosted by "The Wise Man" Paul Heyman this year--2K Showcase: The Bloodline Dynasty will also allow players to alter the outcomes of these matches.</p><p>The trip down wrestling memory lane features a selection of classic bouts, including Yokozuna's infamous battle against Hulk Hogan at the 1993 King of the Ring, the brutal No Holds Barred match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rikishi, and the Royal Rumble 2022 showdown between Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.</p><p>Each match fits into one of three categories--Relive History, Change History, and Create History--and in total, 15 of them have been revealed so far. Here's the full list:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz8zsUmIBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tnz8zsUmIBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>Relive History</h3><ul><li>Yokozuna (with Mr. Fuji) vs. Hulk Hogan -- King of the Ring 1993</li><li>Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley -- RAW February 13, 1997</li><li>Nia Jax vs. Lyra Valkyria -- Queen of the Ring 2024</li><li>The Usos vs. The New Day (with Big E) -- Hell in a Cell 2017</li><li>Solo Sikoa vs. Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) -- NXT September 13, 2022</li></ul><h3>Change History</h3><ul><li>The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) vs. The Steiner Brothers -- WrestleMania IX</li><li>Rikishi vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin -- No Mercy 2000</li><li>Umaga (with Armando Estrada) vs. John Cena -- New Year's Revolution 2007</li><li>Tamina vs. Natalya vs. Carmella vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch -- Money in the Bank 2017</li><li>Naomi vs. Bayley -- Super ShowDown 2020</li><li>Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins -- Royal Rumble 2022</li></ul><h3>Create History</h3><ul><li>High Chief Peter Miavia vs. George "The Animal" Steele</li><li>The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) vs. The Dudley Boyz</li><li>The OG Bloodline vs. New Bloodline in WarGames</li><li>The Islanders (Haku and Tama) vs. The Street Profits</li></ul><p>Showcase Mode is typically one of the biggest highlights of a WWE 2K game, but this year's version of the mode is a big departure from previous instances, as it focuses on the Anoa'i family instead of a single superstar. The last couple of years in WWE programming have seen Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and several other members of that extended wrestling dynasty rise to prominence, while other WWE legends like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the late Umaga, and the Wild Samoans have all been praised for their contributions to the sports entertainment industry.</p><p>Beyond the Showcase mode, you can also hop on a boat and head to The Island--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-shows-off-its-new-open-world-island-mode-for-the-first-time/1100-6529460/">a new social space</a> that looks like it was heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City--take part in custom exhibition matches, and chart your own rise to the top as part of the MyRise mode. WWE 2K25 will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4 on March 14, but if you purchase the Deadman Edition or The Bloodline Edition, you'll get into the game a week early on March 7.</p><p>"With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-like-cody-rhodes-explores-what-comes-after-you-finish-the-story/1100-6529209/">WWE 2K25 preview</a>. "There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Not only can you do it yourself in Design Home, but now the game will let you become your own DIY star for HGTV with a new collaboration. For starters, a Fixer to Fabulous crossover has already kicked off in the mobile title. Next up are weekly challenges based on House Hunters, one of the most popular shows on the network.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fixer to Fabulous crossover began February 19 in Design Home, with weekly challenges called Bentonville Beauty and Arkansas Amazement. The partnership will also be reciprocated. An upcoming episode of Fixer to Faborlous--set to air on March 25--will see hosts Dave and Jenny Marrs playing the mobile title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMhq6vyZKv0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WMhq6vyZKv0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There's no date yet for the House Hunters challenges; EA says they will be coming soon. The company also states Design Home has seen 131 million players worldwide, and the HGTV collaboration isn't the first partnership for the game. For example, almost a year ago, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/design-home/news/design-home-sims-freeplay-interior-design-series" rel="nofollow ">renovation game partnered up with Sims Freeplay</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Design Home launched in 2016 and wasn't originally under EA's umbrella. That changed, however, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-completes-acquisition-of-glu-mobile-in-2-1-billion-deal/1100-6490777/">the company acquired Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion</a> in 2021. Design Home is still free-to-play but features in-app purchases. EA touts that actual brands, such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, can be utilized to decorate interior rooms in the game.</p>

                <p>The recent announcement that NetEase was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laying off some of its US-based Marvel Rivals developers</a>, including one of the game's directors, prompted concern and questions given that the hero shooter is performing well in the market <a href="https://ir.netease.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2025/02/20/3-04-13/Q4%202024%20Earnings%20Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with 40 million players</a>. Now, a clearer picture of what's going on and the context behind the shocking decision is coming into focus.</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published a report</a> in which he offered his take. Ahmad said there is "some truth" to how various Chinese game companies are downsizing their US operations due in part to "geopolitical risks" under the new Trump administration. However, there may be more to the story. Ahmad said the "full picture is more nuanced" and might also reflect NetEase performing a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p><p>In addition to the layoffs at the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase is Seattle--under a dozen people were reportedly affected--NetEase made a number of other significant drawbacks to its global games business. Ahmad pointed out how NetEase either closed or scaled down funding for Ouka Studio in Japan, Worlds Untold in Canada, and Jar of Sparks in the US. More recently, Just Cause creator Christopher Sundberg's new studio Liquid Swords announced cuts, as did Halo Infinite co-developer SkyBox Labs in Canada. Both teams were funded in part by NetEase.</p><p>"NetEase aggressively expanded its overseas footprint between 2019 and 2023, opening and investing in numerous studios outside China with the aim to develop high-end PC and console games," Ahmad said. "NetEase's recent decisions regarding its overseas investments and studio operations reflect a broader recalibration of its global strategy, driven by multiple factors. This change in strategy has impacted both US based studios and non-US based studios."</p><p>Ahmad went on to note that the "core" development team for Marvel Rivals is based in Guangzhou, China. This includes a second game director, Guangyun Chen, alongside the US-based director, Thaddeus Sasser, who was let go this week.</p><p>Also in his note, Ahmad said NetEase and other Chinese giants like Tencent and miHoYo invested significantly in overseas games and teams to try to reach players globally. However, Ahmad said a "turning point" for Chinese companies came in 2024 when Black Myth: Wukong, developed by a relatively small Chinese team at Game Science, broke out and became a giant success.</p><p>"The success of Black Myth: Wukong challenged the industry's assumption that only Western or Japanese AAA studios could produce globally competitive PC and console titles," Ahmad said.</p><p>So why did NetEase cut its US-based Marvel Rivals development team? We may never know the real answer, but Ahmad said it has more to do with "high costs and lower returns" over the past few years following a pullback after the boom of the pandemic. "Therefore, streamlining operations helps reduce costs and shorten development cycles, and NetEase is now following a new strategy both for these reasons and to mitigate risk from US-China policy changes," he said.</p><p>It's not just NetEase that's scaling back operations in the US, as the US video game industry has undergone turbulent times of late, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">thousands of layoffs rocking the business in the past few years.</a> These cuts come as some US-based video game companies, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including Electronic Arts, continue to see huge profits.</a></p>

                <p>A recent report said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was at one point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-could-have-shuttered-xbox-prior-to-major-acquisitions-report/1100-6528826/" data-ref-id="1100-6528826">mulling the possibility of shuttering the Xbox division</a>. Before this, Microsoft's own co-founder Paul Allen's investment company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cofounder-s-investment-group-calls-for-xbox-spinoff/1100-6415919/" data-ref-id="1100-6415919">called for Microsoft to dump Xbox and spin it off as a separate business</a>. That never happened, and now Nadella is speaking up to express Microsoft's commitment to gaming. He told <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarkesh Patel</a> that it's not true that Microsoft's investments in gaming is part of some kind of "means to some other end."</p><p>Microsoft has a long history of supporting gaming, Nadella pointed out, referencing how Microsoft Flight Simulator was a Microsoft product before the company even made the first version of Windows.</p><p>"So, gaming has got a long history at the company, and we want to be in gaming for gaming's sake. I always start by saying I hate to be in businesses where they're means to some other end. They have to be ends unto themselves," he said.</p><p>Nadella's comments came in response to a question about if Nadella had some kind of "premonition" about how gaming could help contribute to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Microsoft's push into the artificial intelligence space by using games to train its models. </a></p><p>"We are a company where we have to bring all these assets together and be better owners by adding value. For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge. Ninja Theory has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Muse won't be use to make games</a>, but instead to help empower humans to work faster.</p><p>"I think about gaming data as perhaps, you know, what YouTube is perhaps to Google, gaming data is to Microsoft. And so therefore I'm excited about that," Nadella said.</p><p>AI is a controversial technology within the gaming space and across numerous other businesses. A recent GDC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">study</a> found that the majority of game studios worldwide use generative AI already, despite concerns about the technology. Microsoft itself has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">gone on record saying advancements to AI will lead to job losses</a> in the short term but may lead to more opportunities in the long term. Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 people in the past year in gaming roles, though whether or not the reduction had anything to do with AI is unknown. Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>

                <p>Are you enjoying Avowed? Are you also a fan of growing kits? What about fungus? Well, you're in luck, because Obsidian Entertainment and North Spore have revealed that they're collaborating on a limited-edition <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit?srsltid=AfmBOooM2qgOl4rDGozwQIj3SmWoOhSd9iP1pN-jDoVNk6v6h1a4hGSY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avowed-themed growing kit</a>. It's set to ship out sometime later this month.</p><p>The Organic "Spray &amp; Grow" Avowed Mushroom Growing Kit is modeled after the Dreamthrall Elder Bear, an early-game boss in Avowed. In the game, the Dreamscourge disease has infected the Living Lands, and the bear has succumbed to its primal, savage urges. The infection causes organisms to sprout all over organisms, so a growing kit is certainly a thematically fitting collaboration.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446845,1300-4446844,1300-4446843,1300-4446842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"></figure><p>The kit costs $30 and comes with one of three different mushrooms: blue oyster, pink oyster, or golden oyster--it's a surprise which one you'll get. According to the kit's specifications, it weighs four pounds and takes two weeks to grow. It lasts for six months and while the blue and golden oyster mushrooms can be refrigerated, the pink ones cannot be.</p><p>Xbox is no stranger to themed merchandise of its own games. While not a collaboration, Bethesda sold a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-some-out-of-this-world-sleep-with-the-starfield-duvet-cover-set/1100-6519405/" data-ref-id="1100-6519405">Starfield-themed bedding set</a> that included a navy duvet cover and two pillowcases.</p><p>Avowed is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass.

                <p>A new Pokemon Presents livestream has been confirmed for February 27 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and pocket monster fans can expect updates on new in-development projects related to the franchise. The Pokemon Company hasn't revealed any details on what will be shown exactly, but fans are expecting to see an update on the next big tentpole game in the franchise, Pokemon Legends Z-A, as well as sneak peeks at other spin-offs in the pipeline.</p><p>The Pokemon Presents livestream has become an annual tradition--these have been held every February since 2021--with additional Pokemon Presents being broadcast closer to big Pokemon game releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> is expected to be the main event, as it's currently scheduled for release on Switch.</p><p>We still have some burning questions for the second entry in the Pokemon Legends series, as so far, we've only seen a brief teaser trailer that heavily hinted at a return to the Kalos region that was introduced in Pokemon X and Y.</p><p>2024 was also an interesting year for the franchise, as no new mainline games or remakes were released. This is the first time since 2015 that the Pokemon series has taken a year off, as in the last decade, developer Game Freak and other studios have consistently pumped out new releases, spin-offs, and expansions.</p><p>The Pokemon Company also has numerous other franchise games that are still active, like Pokemon Go, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket, Pokemon Unite, Pokemon Masters EX, and Pokemon Cafe, to name a few.</p>
