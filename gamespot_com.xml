                <p>At the end of last month, Funcom introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-dune-awakenings-huge-endgame-pve-changes-are-now-live-thanks-to-a-hotfix/1100-6532751/">some highly-requested endgame changes</a> that turned half of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening's</a> player vs. player Deep Desert zone into a player vs. environment area. However, earlier this week another patch was released that caused a number of areas in Deep Desert to switch back to PvP, resulting in a number of players losing out on bases, equipment, and vehicles. In response, Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/" rel="nofollow ">shared an apology letter</a>, explaining the steps it plans to take to make it up to players.</p><p dir="ltr">Talking about how this mistake took place, Funcom explained that this was an "oversight in our development process and internal communications" and was "intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle. We’re incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Funcom noted that it will be working to "reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this," and that those affected can find reimbursed items in the in-game "Claim Rewards" tab by the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also outlined some of its other goals for future updates, which includes removing "all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics)," as well as adding in more quality of life features, and fixing numerous ongoing gameplay issues. It also noted how it's fixed things like account/permission spoofing, vehicle ownership takeover, durability repair, and building dismantle item duplication.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have been affected by item and vehicle loss due to bugs, as opposed to the recent update, Funcom asked for your patience as it currently has a long backlog of customer support requests. It's aiming to deal with these as quickly as it can, including for closed tickets from players who weren't reimbursed properly when the developer wasn't able to around launch. Funcom also said the game has an entire team dedicated to mitigating vehicle and item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about trying the game out for yourself despite its teething issues, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-awakening-review/1900-6418381/" data-ref-id="1900-6418381">Dune Awakening review</a>.</p>

                <p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming to PS5, ending its console exclusivity on Xbox. An release date has not been announced, but it will be out in late 2025, and you can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014084" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist</a> it now.</p><p dir="ltr">In a rather meta announcement trailer, rendered in-engine, soldiers are shown huddled around the colonel, who has his feet up while playing what appears to be Stalker 2 on the TV with a controller. It's eventually revealed that the controller resembles that of a PlayStation controller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw">IGN</a>, the description adds that the PS5 version "will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion." It will also include "technical enhancements" for the PS5 Pro, although there are no further details.</p><p dir="ltr">While we await more information and its release date, you can watch our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">Stalker 2 documentary</a> about how developers were affected first-hand by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 launched last November as an Xbox console exclusive, although leaked documents alleged that it was only going to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-only-has-three-month-exclusivity-on-stalker-2/1100-6490905/">timed exclusive for three months</a>. The longer wait could be related to the buggy state that the game launched in, with issues plaguing the post-apocalyptic shooter following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/">day-one patch</a>, while its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-major-patch-has-more-than-1800-bug-fixes/1100-6528561/">first major patch</a> fixed more than 1,800 bugs.</p><p>This follows other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/">first-party Xbox exclusives making the leap to other platforms</a>, when early last year Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirmed four first-party Xbox titles would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. This has continued in 2025 with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> following its original launch last December, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will release day-and-date on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC in August.</p>

                <p>Free-to-play mech extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steel-hunters/" data-ref-id="5000-654971">Steel Hunters</a>, originally revealed at 2024's The Game Awards, will shut down just a few months after its early access launch, developer Wargaming has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Servers will shut down on October 8, around seven months after the game's launch. The PC-only shooter released in early April but never seemed to find an audience, having only reached a concurrent player peak of 4,479 shortly after launch, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1691340/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In recent weeks the game's player count has hovered around the 250 mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLIAwGOBZ0w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLIAwGOBZ0w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable," Wargaming's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> on the sunsetting of Steel Hunters reads. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p><p dir="ltr">However, players have the next 90 days to still play the game, during which Wargaming will unlock all of the game's unique Hunters (including new Hunters that were presumably still in development), as well as introduce the ability to host custom games. A final "farewell" tournament is also being planned, with Wargaming stating it will share more details in the game's official Discord server soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters sees players pilot massive mechs called Hunters. Some mechs are humanoid in appearance, while others are massive mechanical animals reminiscent of the mechs from the anime series Zoids. Each mech can be customized and modified with various weapons, mods, and abilities. The game was an extraction shooter, one where players would drop in, acquire loot from battling NPC enemies, and attempt to escape, all the while avoiding or battling other player-controlled Hunter squads.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very first days of the Alpha you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey," Wargaming's shutdown notice reads.
