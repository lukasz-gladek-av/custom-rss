                <p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming to PS5, ending its console exclusivity on Xbox. An release date has not been announced, but it will be out in late 2025, and you can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014084" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist</a> it now.</p><p dir="ltr">In a rather meta announcement trailer, rendered in-engine, soldiers are shown huddled around the colonel, who has his feet up while playing what appears to be Stalker 2 on the TV with a controller. It's eventually revealed that the controller resembles that of a PlayStation controller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw">IGN</a>, the description adds that the PS5 version "will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion." It will also include "technical enhancements" for the PS5 Pro, although there are no further details.</p><p dir="ltr">While we await more information and its release date, you can watch our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">Stalker 2 documentary</a> about how developers were affected first-hand by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 launched last November as an Xbox console exclusive, although leaked documents alleged that it was only going to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-only-has-three-month-exclusivity-on-stalker-2/1100-6490905/">timed exclusive for three months</a>. The longer wait could be related to the buggy state that the game launched in, with issues plaguing the post-apocalyptic shooter following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/">day-one patch</a>, while its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-major-patch-has-more-than-1800-bug-fixes/1100-6528561/">first major patch</a> fixed more than 1,800 bugs.</p><p>This follows other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/">first-party Xbox exclusives making the leap to other platforms</a>, when early last year Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirmed four first-party Xbox titles would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. This has continued in 2025 with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> following its original launch last December, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will release day-and-date on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC in August.</p>

                <p>Free-to-play mech extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steel-hunters/" data-ref-id="5000-654971">Steel Hunters</a>, originally revealed at 2024's The Game Awards, will shut down just a few months after its early access launch, developer Wargaming has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Servers will shut down on October 8, around seven months after the game's launch. The PC-only shooter released in early April but never seemed to find an audience, having only reached a concurrent player peak of 4,479 shortly after launch, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1691340/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In recent weeks the game's player count has hovered around the 250 mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLIAwGOBZ0w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLIAwGOBZ0w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable," Wargaming's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> on the sunsetting of Steel Hunters reads. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p><p dir="ltr">However, players have the next 90 days to still play the game, during which Wargaming will unlock all of the game's unique Hunters (including new Hunters that were presumably still in development), as well as introduce the ability to host custom games. A final "farewell" tournament is also being planned, with Wargaming stating it will share more details in the game's official Discord server soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters sees players pilot massive mechs called Hunters. Some mechs are humanoid in appearance, while others are massive mechanical animals reminiscent of the mechs from the anime series Zoids. Each mech can be customized and modified with various weapons, mods, and abilities. The game was an extraction shooter, one where players would drop in, acquire loot from battling NPC enemies, and attempt to escape, all the while avoiding or battling other player-controlled Hunter squads.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very first days of the Alpha you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey," Wargaming's shutdown notice reads. "We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly."</p><p dir="ltr">Wargaming may be shutting down Steel Hunters, but it still operates several live-service titles. One of those games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a>, which recently announced it is introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-two-90s-gaming-icons-are-coming-to-world-of-tanks/1100-6533014/" data-ref-id="1100-6533014">tank versions of two '90s gaming icons</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters isn't the first live-service game to be gone too soon, and it likely won't be the last. Nexon's free-to-play multiplayer melee title<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-live-service-game-is-shutting-down-just-months-after-launch/1100-6520621/" data-ref-id="1100-6520621"> Warhaven shut down after just seven months</a> and ahead of a planned console launch last year, and Sony's shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord infamously barely lasted a week</a> before it was announced servers would go offline. EA recently announced it would finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/" data-ref-id="1100-6532956">pull the plug on Anthem's servers</a>, with players having until January 2026 to play BioWare's live-service shooter.</p>

                <p>Sorry, Valve, but it seems that you aren't the top dog on your own storefront anymore, at least when it comes to having the highest-rated game on Steam anyway. For a long while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/portal-2/" data-ref-id="5000-70564">Portal 2</a> has gone unchallenged in its top-rated spot on Steam, but as tracked by <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" rel="nofollow ">Steam Top 250</a>, none other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> has moved above it. Mind, the difference in rating is quite minimal, but nonetheless Eric "ConceredApe" Barone's beloved farming sim is currently the highest-rated game on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably worth noting that Steam Top 250 explains that the scores assigned to each game are based on two things: number of votes, and the approval rating, i.e. percentage, of positive votes. Stardew Valley has just under 900,000 votes, more than double the amount of votes that Portal 2 has, 436,665. The former technically has a one percent lower count of positive votes compared to the latter, but it's that ratio of positive votes to overall votes that has net Stardew Valley the top spot.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, when looking at the top 10 highest-rated games across Steam, most of them have been around for at least a few years, if not a lot longer, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-survivors/" data-ref-id="5000-544864">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead-2/" data-ref-id="5000-43544">Left 4 Dead 2</a>, and the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/portal/" data-ref-id="5000-27599">Portal</a>. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> is also there in ninth place, a game that only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/" data-ref-id="1100-6530401">just launched in early access in March of this year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A big new update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-hits-new-peak-concurrents-record-on-steam-thanks-to-update-1-6/1100-6521971/">did arrive in Stardew Valley last year</a>, and while Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">hasn't ruled out making a Stardew Valley 2 eventually</a>, right now he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">back to working</a> on his follow-up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/" data-ref-id="5000-540129">Haunted Chocolatier</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Razer has a new collaboration in the works with Pokemon, having teased the news on social media. It will be officially revealed later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">The gaming company shared a post on Twitter on July 7, with the question, "Are you ready for a new journey?" while tagging the official Pokemon account, along with the date and time of the announcement for July 17 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. A short video with yellow fonts on a black background with the Razer logo pulsing with electricity suggests that this could be Pikachu-related.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on replies from Razer's account (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/pokemon-tease" rel="nofollow ">PCGamesN</a>), it seems this may be a collaboration that won't be region-locked, as has been the case with Razer and Pokemon partnerships in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Razer has already previously released gaming peripherals featuring Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee, but these had only been limited to a few regions, excluding the US. It's not clear whether this will include past collab products or something completely new, but wider availability will certainly be appreciated by Pokemon fans who haven't been able to get hold of a Pokemon keyboard or mouse, at least not without braving scalpers.</p><p dir="ltr">There's plenty of other partnerships Razer has with other major gaming brands, including Minecraft and Roblox, but a new Pokemon partnership will no doubt be a very hot item. That also comes ahead of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/">Pokemon Presents Livestream</a> happening on July 22, where we expect there will be more news on Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>

                <p>Dynasty mode is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and rightfully so. You're given the reigns of an entire school program and entrusted with making every decision regarding the team you put on the field. At the start of a Dynasty playthrough, you're able to pick your school and whether you're a head coach or offensive/defensive coordinator. If you choose to be a head coach, you then need to decide if you're going to use the school's real-life coach or design your own coach.</p><p>If you opt for the latter option, you get to fully customize your coach's appearance just like you would a custom player in Road to Glory. However, creating a custom coach also means you need to select a Coach Archetype, which can be a tricky task in College Football 26. To see the differences between the three Archetypes and which one you should pick, check out the guide below.</p><h2>What are the Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode?</h2><p>If you played any College Football 25, then the Dynasty Archetypes will be familiar, as they're the same ones that are in College Football 26. There are three in total, and they are:</p><ul><li>Motivator (example: Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame)</li><li>Recruiter (example: Dan Lanning, Oregon)</li><li>Tactician (example: Steve Starkisian, Texas)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601"></a><figcaption>The three Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg"></figure><p>Your decision in a Coach Archetype determines the coaching abilities you have access to early on in a Dynasty playthrough. It also plays a pivotal role in deciding what kind of coach you're going to be and where your strengths lie, both on and off the field.</p><p>When it comes to the coaching abilities you can unlock, every ability has a certain classification. You'll immediately unlock your Archetype's first coaching ability after starting a Dynasty playthrough, and you can unlock more abilities within that Archetype as you progress. However, you can still unlock abilities from other Archetypes, so picking one Archetype doesn't prevent you from being a well-rounded coach in CFB 26.</p><p>The first ability you have unlocked can be progressed to become more advanced, though. For example, if you pick the Recruiter Archetype, you'll immediately unlock the Firm Handshakes ability. This gives you 100 bonus XP for signing a recruit. This ability can be upgraded to Elite Recruiter with enough XP, which has even stronger benefits.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602"></a><figcaption>A look at the coaching abilities in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg"></figure><h2>Best Coach Archetype to pick in College Football 26</h2><p>So, which is the best one to pick? Truthfully, you can't go wrong with any of the selections, as all three Archetypes cover important coaching areas that come with perks you'll want to have in Dynasty mode.</p><p>However, if we were to rank the Archetypes, here's where they would stand:</p><ol><li>Recruiter</li><li>Motivator</li><li>Tactician</li></ol><p>Recruiter is simply the best overall Coach Archetype for your long-term Dynasty playthrough. The other Archetypes focus on player ratings for the most part, and while that will help you win games, there's still an element of skill you need to have.</p><p>On the other hand, the Recruiter Archetype gives you perks that allow you to build a stronger team in the long run. Recruiter allows you to recruit much better players and develop a more efficient scouting process throughout a Dynasty playthrough. Without the Recruiter Archetype and abilities, you'll have a rough time trying to convince players to sign with your program until you manage to unlock some Recruiter abilities.</p><p>What it really comes down to is you can fully control what happens on the field, regardless of whether your players' ratings are boosted or not with the Motivator or Tactician Archetypes. However, you'll have a much harder time controlling what happens in the recruiting process if you don't select the Recruiter Archetype. It helps eliminate some RNG and frustration from a Dynasty playthrough and saves you heaps of time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603"></a><figcaption>Architect is one of the abilities you want to work towards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg"></figure><p>You also have to consider that Motivator and Tactician don't start out with great abilities. You'll have to work your way to abilities such as Architect and Strategist in addition to leveling up the Recruiter abilities. With Recruiter, you can max out your Recruiter abilities or go for some of the other ones to gain strength in additional areas.</p><p>Of course, choosing an Archetype also comes down to personal preference and what you enjoy when you play Dynasty in CFB 26. If you feel you'll really benefit from having players' ratings boosted, then go with Motivator or Tactician. Motivator is the better choice overall since Tactician only boosts players' ratings on gameday, but pick whichever one you feel good about.</p>

                <p>Sounds like Disney is cooking up something in the world of video games. A couple of job listings went up on the Disney Careers website at the end of last month, for <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/california/senior-gameplay-engineer/391/83021111648" rel="nofollow ">senior</a> and regular <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/gameplay-engineer/391/83021111392" rel="nofollow ">gameplay engineer</a> positions. As is par for the course for listings like these, what exactly it is you'd be working on wasn't mentioned, but it does say that Disney is "building an expert development team that will be building a groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p dir="ltr">Both roles mention Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, so it sounds like it might be a cross-property project. Notably, it also mentions that having experience in Unreal Editor for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and Verse (the programming language used for UEFN), making it sound like these roles could be for Disney's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/">previously announced metaverse within Fortnite</a>. That deal saw Disney invest $1.5 billion into Epic Games, though we're yet to see any results from it bar the usual collaborations Fortnite features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, prolific Fortnite leaker Hypex shared that this Disney metaverse had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-fortnite-project-reportedly-reaches-a-major-milestone/1100-6529352/" data-ref-id="1100-6529352">moved into a "stable" build/branch</a>, but aside from the initial announcement last year, there's only been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/">small tease</a> about how the house of mouse's theme parks might integrate with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The senior gameplay designer role also makes mention of requiring experience in the prototyping phase of a project, so you probably shouldn't expect this Disney x Fortnite metaverse for a while yet.</p>
