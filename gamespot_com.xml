                <p>I think we can all agree that a good title makes a great first impression, especially in the busy landscape of video games. Look no further than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</a>, an indie RPG game from developer Fix-a-Bug whose satirical tone is quite obvious from the jump. Can you believe it had an even funnier name in Japan?</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/28/158848.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game*Spark</a> (h/t <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-who-accidentally-listed-game-as-shitty-dungeon-in-japan-says-steam-wishlists-skyrocketed-in-aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> for the translation and reporting) the game's developer Paolo Nicoletti admitted a hilarious anecdote from its development. Earlier this year, Nicoletti uploaded a demo for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles to Steam that boasted a hilarious, not to mention inappropriate, title instead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbyHmklgDWg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PbyHmklgDWg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's name had been localized to Kuso Dungeon, which translates (in the tamest language) to "Crap Dungeon." While <em>kuso </em>is a term that, throughout Asia at least, can broadly denote campiness or parody--making its usage here incredibly appropriate--it can also be misinterpreted to mean any number of Japanese curse words. You see where this is going now.</p><p>In the interview, Nicoletti shares that the unfortunate naming--the result of a less-than-professional-grade localization job--was a complete accident, but one that nonetheless bolstered the game's profile, making for "truly accidental marketing at its finest." Evidently, Japanese audiences started seeing The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles pop up on their Steam feeds while bearing its laughably funny moniker, and as a result, the game went viral on X for a few days. Additionally, its Steam wishlists enjoyed a nice bump in the region.</p><p>Though the title has now been fixed, its seems like the incident has been a boon for Nicoletti and their team, who admitted that the developers were laughing alongside everyone else before quickly fixing the error. Now, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles and its developer are enjoying a great deal more positive buzz than they might have received with a more standard title.</p>

                <p>In the wake of Krafton Inc. becoming an "AI-first" company, developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment said that it won't adhere to its publisher's wishes, confirming that the team isn't using generative AI for the action-adventure survival sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a>.</p><p>In a post on the game's official Discord server, community manager Donya Abramo explained the relationship between a publisher and a developer. Likening it to that of a library, Abramo said that Krafton Inc. provides the tools while Unknown Worlds Entertainment chooses what it will and won't use for development, and GenAI is one of those tools that the team will simply not touch.</p>

<p>"We're not using generative AI to develop Subnautica 2," Abramo wrote. "We have an 'AI system' in the game that is similar to ones that have always been in our games: the creature behavior trees."</p><p>Abramo then pointed players to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1M4b6PneFk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September 16 developer vlog</a>, which went into detail about the "creature behavior trees" the team uses in the game. According to AI gameplay lead engineer Antonio Muñoz Gallego, Unknown Worlds Entertainment uses "classic AI," a form of the tech that "improves the hero trees" to make creatures more reactive to player inputs and environmental happenings. It's all a very tech-y way of saying that Subnautica 2's AI is built by humans rather than code generated by other forms of code.</p><p>As such, Abramo said that players can rest assured knowing that the developers won't use generative AI for Subnautica 2 because the team's workflow has already been established.</p><p>"It is very unlikely that that will change," Abramo continued. "We already have a lot of our teams, pipelines, and systems set up. But, ultimately, our relationship with Krafton is the same as it has always been. They provide us access to valuable tools and resources, and we choose which are the right fit for our projects."</p><p>This comes after Krafton Inc.--publisher of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica/" data-ref-id="5000-244763">Subnautica</a> games, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-started-work-on-hi-fi-rush-2-before-microsoft-closure/1100-6526814/" data-ref-id="1100-6526814">Tango Gameworks' upcoming Hi-Fi Rush 2</a>--announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">a $70 million investment into generative AI</a> to become a leading force for the controversial technology in the games industry.

                <p>A datamine has revealed when players will be able to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> full suite of player-housing systems, giving an indication of when the MMORPG's next expansion will launch in full.</p><p dir="ltr">As datamined by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-splash-screen-reveals-midnight-pre-patch-launches-by-january-27th-379054#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the Midnight pre-patch, which will introduce class changes and new systems (though not the actual new zones, dungeons, or other expansion content) looks to be coming on or around January 27, 2026. The datamined splash screen for the patch points out Neighborhoods, the void-focused Devourer Demon Hunter specialization, and a new pre-patch event called Twilight Ascension as new additions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The event, which looks to have players dealing with cultists of the Twilight Hammer, states it will be available on January 27. That puts the likely release date of the expansion itself in the following three or four weeks sometime in February. Blizzard has not yet given an officiall release date for when Midnight, or the pre-patch, will release.</p><p dir="ltr">While players who preorder Midnight will be able to buy and start decorating their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">homes with the arrival of WoW's 11.2.7 patch</a>, expected in early December, it won't be until the arrival of Neighborhoods that the game's long-awaited player-housing system is fully complete. Neighborhoods allow players to participate in special community events and complete challenges that will unlock new decorations and change the appearance of neighborhoods themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">If the pre-patch event is like previous ones, players should probably expect to kill lots of cultists intent on destroying Azeroth. The event will likely be a great way to level up new characters (like a Devourer Demon Hunter) and get them up to speed with special event catch-up gear.</p><p dir="ltr">The arrival of the pre-patch will also bring one other big change to WoW in that it will officially mark the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">end of combat add-ons</a>. Since the launch of the Midnight alpha, Blizzard has revealed the steps it's taking to eliminate the ability to use (and the need for) player-created mods that specialize in assisting players in combat. While it's a worthy goal, some players and add-on makers have been less than happy with how Blizzard has approached the major change in add-on philosophy, with several prominent add-on creators announcing their add-ons won't be updated for Midnight.</p>
