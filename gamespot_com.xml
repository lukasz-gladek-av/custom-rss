                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man 2</a> was already one of the best PlayStation 5 games when it was released last year, and it was a natural choice to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-discovered-including-fortnite-and-madden-nfl-25/1100-6526761/" data-ref-id="1100-6526761">one of the first PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>. The question for players is whether those visual upgrades are worth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag</a>. That's why some of the developers behind Spider-Man 2 have contributed to a new video that shows off what the game looks like when run on the more powerful system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhReCdn5Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kAhReCdn5Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"When players play Marvel Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro, they are playing the quintessential version of the Spider-Man experience on the PlayStation 5," said Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar. As part of the demonstration, Intihar noted that players can send either Spider-Man swinging through New York at 60 frames per second without losing the clarity of graphics from the game's fidelity mode.</p><p>Senior art director Jacinda Chew added that Spider-Man 2 is filled with reflective surfaces, from water to the skyscraper windows, and even Spider-Man's goggles. Those are details that could easily be overlooked considering how much is happening on screen at any given moment in the game. With PS5 Pro, those reflections are much easier to notice and appreciate.</p><p>That still might not be enough to convince some players to make the leap to Sony's mid-generation update. But as far as Intihar is concerned, he's happy that players get to have the choice of how they want to play Spider-Man 2.</p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7.</p>
