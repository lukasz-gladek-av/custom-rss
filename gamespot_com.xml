                <p>Today is the release date for Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and fans aren't the only ones who want to get their hands on it. Pocketpair, the developer of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-breed-pals-guide/1100-6520645/" data-ref-id="1100-6520645">Palworld</a>, is declaring today a special day off just to let its employees dive into Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair wrote on social media that it had received word from several of its employees that they might be feeling sick on the last day of the month, which just so happened to be the day of Monster Hunter Wilds' release. Instead of insisting that employees show up as scheduled, Pocketpair gave them a holiday.</p><p>Palworld's community manager, Bucky, subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1895239908031373790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed that this is what happened</a>. It's a very nice gesture, and probably well-deserved. Pocketpair's dev team has a lot of work ahead of then, as laid out in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-roadmap-includes-lots-of-exciting-new-features-including-co-op-cross-play/1100-6528896/" data-ref-id="1100-6528896">roadmap of updates coming to Palworld</a> in its second year. Some of the game's upcoming features include co-op cross-play, new pals, and new endgame content. Thanks to the team's ongoing efforts, Palworld recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-massive-new-player-milestone-year-2-promised-to-be-even-better/1100-6529574/" data-ref-id="1100-6529574">crossed a milestone with 32 million players</a> from across the globe in the game's first year.</p><p>Outside of the game itself, Pocketworld still has to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">deal with the lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company in Japan</a> over a small handful of patent infringement claims. Although that case has yet to be resolved, Pocketworld recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-launches-new-game-on-switch-in-middle-of-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6528719/" data-ref-id="1100-6528719">released Overdungeon on Switch</a>.</p><p>As for Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom has already shared details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-post-launch-update-already-revealed/1100-6529474/" data-ref-id="1100-6529474">the first big post-launch update</a>.

                <p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches today, February 28, and some players have run into issues with the Steam version.

                <p>While Ubisoft hasn't talked much about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2/" data-ref-id="5000-35207">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> in a long time, the series has a cameo in Astro Bot's newest level. In Cock-A-Doodle-Doom, Jade from Beyond Good &amp; Evil is the VIP Bot that players can find.</p><p>Cock-A-Doodle-Doom is one of five new levels that will be <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">coming to Astro Bot weekly</a> between February and March. Team Asobi has added several levels to the game since its release, and each new level has its own VIP Bot that serves as a cameo for a franchise important to the history of PlayStation. Rayman was a VIP bot in a post-launch level a couple of months ago, and now Ubisoft let Team Asobi add Jade as another Ubisoft representative. Her VIP Bot is called Rebel Photographer, and the game says this bot "Fights the good fight against evil."</p><p>Jade is the protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, a Ubisoft franchise that's quite infamous. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-4537">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a> is a sci-fi action-adventure game from 2003 that became a cult classic. Ubisoft announced a follow-up a few years later, but it has notably been in development hell ever since. A new version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, now a narrative prequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-jade-returns-in-beyond-good-and-evil-2/1100-6459690/" data-ref-id="1100-6459690">starring a younger Jade</a>, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2017-beyond-good-and-evil-2-trailer-makes-surpr/1100-6450825/" data-ref-id="1100-6450825">shown off by Ubisoft in 2017</a>. Almost eight years later, though, and the game still hasn't come out.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skull-and-bones/" data-ref-id="5000-465570">Skull and Bones</a>' long path from announcement to release is well-known, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 somehow makes that development timeline look short. While Ubisoft has not publicly shown much of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 in years, it is not canceled as Ubisoft tries to keep the series relevant. A remaster of the first game came out last year, and now Jade is appearing in Astro Bot alongside iconic characters like Solid Snake, Rayman, and Kazuma Kiryu.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> is available now exclusively on PS5. As for when Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will be available, who knows?</p>

                <p>Split Fiction and It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios will never put microtransactions in its games, according to director Josef Fares.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with MinnMax</a>, Fares also said that Hazelight Studios isn't available for bigger publishers to buy it out. "Hazelight is not for sale. I mean, we will always do what we do, and we love what to do period," Fares explained. "And we will never be on the stock market as well; get that in, period. And we will never have microtransactions, bullshit, no shit, just make games. Period."</p>

      </div>
<p>Recently, Fares also said that Hazelight <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-boss-says-studio-will-never-make-a-live-service-game/1100-6529501/" data-ref-id="1100-6529501">won't make live-service games</a> either. Microtransactions are common to in live-service games, as studios and publishers who make them want a recurring stream of revenue.</p><p>Microtransactions can seem appealing, as players are offered a constant stream of new content such as cosmetics. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/microtransactions-are-getting-out-of-hand-spot-on/2300-6461962/" data-ref-id="2300-6461962">players have expressed concern</a> that microtransactions have gotten out of hand, as they feel like they're being squeezed for every bit of cash.</p><p>Hazelight specializes in co-op games, and their games are consumer friendly in that they often offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-cross-play-and-friends-pass-free-access-explained/1100-6529627/" data-ref-id="1100-6529627">Friend Pass</a> so that only one person needs to purchase Split Fiction in order to play with another.</p><p>Ironically, all of Hazelight's games so far have been published by Electronic Arts, whose CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">said that AI will drive microtransaction sales</a>. Electronic Arts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-earnings-report-billions-in-microtransaction-revenue-star-wars-reaches-52-million-sold-bioware-comments-more/1100-6487042/" data-ref-id="1100-6487042">has made billions in the past through microtransactions.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-only-split-fiction-is-an-impressive-leap-forward-from-the-makers-of-it-takes-two/1100-6528426/" data-ref-id="1100-6528426">Split Fiction</a> launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
