                <p>The release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorder-release-date-bonuses-editions/1100-6526687/" data-ref-id="1100-6526687">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is just around the corner, but one player has taken the time between sequels to create an even harder way to play an earlier game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-deadliest-catch/1900-6416842/" data-ref-id="1900-6416842">Monster Hunter: World</a>. Aaron Callaway decided to beat the game without any weapons by relying only on emotes, including the Hadoken fireball popularized by Street Fighter's Ryu and Ken.</p><p>Callaway posted a video on YouTube that demonstrated how an emote-only Monster Hunter: World run works. He notes that the other two emotes used were Street Fighter's Shoryuken and Devil May Cry's guns. However, the Shoryuken drained too much stamina and the DmC emote wasn't ideal either. That's why Callaway came to rely on the Hadoken, even though it's also comparatively weak and can only dish out 13 points in damage at most.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFHmXH1YPig" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFHmXH1YPig" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's one thing to say you've done something and another to show it. To prove his achievement, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gCKiFdOKOw&amp;list=PLO4z6_n8_7oNZYvHyyNXbiL2XjjY6yCc9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callaway posted his gameplay videos</a> from his emote-only Monster Hunter: World run. The first video alone is just under three hours, but these videos demonstrate that the challenge is possible, even though there's no Achievement or Trophy waiting at the end for sticking with it.</p><p>Capcom recently announced that there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-another-cross-platform-beta-next-month/1100-6528691/" data-ref-id="1100-6528691">a new cross-platform open beta for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> in February over the course of two weekends. The first open beta for Wilds attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a> last fall. Capcom noted that it incorporated improvements to the game based on that beta, but those changes won't be implemented in the second beta. Instead, players will have to wait for the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds on February 28 to see what has changed.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-09-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details about Destiny 2's latest updates</a>, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pVboiodni8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-pVboiodni8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fotl2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to begin voting</a> for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. </p><p>Earlier this month, the original Destiny <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-destiny-game-gets-strange-update-for-new-years/1100-6528649/" data-ref-id="1100-6528649">got a holiday-themed update</a>, which surprised players since the focus has been on Destiny 2 for years. Late last year, players also discovered an exploit that gave them the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for free. Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-who-found-a-destiny-2-exploit-can-keep-their-free-loot-says-bungie/1100-6528364/" data-ref-id="1100-6528364">was pretty cool about that</a> and allowed players to keep the upgrade even though it ordinarily costs $10.</p>

                <p>It's the start of a new year, and if you're looking to ring it in with discounts on several games, then you can check out <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-control-ultimate-edition-on-pc-for-just-5-in-fanaticals-latest-bundle-deal%2F1100-6528716%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's January 2025 edition of its Diamond Collection bundle</a>. Like previous versions of this build-your-own-bundle deal, you'll choose from a list of games to build your very own bundle, and pricing depends on how many games you pick, with the price per code dropping the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per game), and scales up to five or more games for $23 ($4.60 per game), and at seven or games you'll only pay $4.50 per game. If you add all 16 possible games to your bundle, you'll only pay $72 total.</p><p>There are some great titles here like Control: Ultimate Edition. This paranormal-themed action adventure game melds third-person shooting with Metroidvania-style level design. It comes from Remedy, the same studio behind the Alan Wake series, which happens to share the same fictional universe with Control. In fact, some of the bonus content included in Control: Ultimate Edition ties into the recent Allan Wake II.</p><p>Another strong recommendation is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game is a spiritual successor to the 2D Castlevania games and is even directed by Koji Igarashi, who popularized the "Igavania" style of Castlevania games that started with Symphony of the Night. </p><p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is also on offer and is a great choice if you're looking to scratch your itch for a Smash Bros-style fighting game. This one features plenty of iconic cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, and Jimmy Neutron, and the Ultimate Edition comes with a ton of extra content.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection for this month, including the open-world crime sandbox Saints Row: Gold Edition, the satirical alien planet exploration FPS Journey to the Savage Planet, multiplayer brawler TMNT Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, and many more.
