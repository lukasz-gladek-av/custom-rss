                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is currently putting Agent 47 on the backburner while focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">the upcoming James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a>. However, the new Bond title may take some cues from Hitman: World of Assassination' live-service approach by adding new missions post-launch.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak hinted at the possibility of providing Bond with ongoing support during an extended interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," said Abrak. "The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</p><p>Abrak went on to note that First Light will feature greater stealth, action, and seamless combat options that let players switch between ranged attacks and melee on the fly. He added that Bond will follow his character's long-standing tradition of driving exotic cars.</p><p>"That gives us more challenges to play with," added Abrak. "In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond."</p><p>The most recently released Hitman elusive target mission may be a good model for any live-service 007 First Light content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. If First Light can draw upon some of the classic villains from Bond's previous films, then there are ample opportunities to revisit some fan-favorites.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous Bond incarnation and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

                <p>Frontier Development will no longer be using generative AI to create scientist portraits in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3/" data-ref-id="5000-629003">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> following player backlash against a disclaimer revealing the use of AI.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is a park management game based on the iconic dinosaur film franchise and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-announced-with-jeff-goldblum-devs-used-generative-ai/1100-6532200/" data-ref-id="1100-6532200">announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. Its announcement excited fans, with trailers for the game garnering over 1 million views. But fans quickly spotted an AI use disclaimer on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> that explained generative AI would be used for scientist portraits. Players quickly took to its Steam forums to complain about the use of AI in Jurassic World Evolution 3. Some players went as far as to call the developers "lazy" and "pathetic" for using AI in their game instead of having artists design these portraits. </p><p>Eventually, Frontier Developments responded to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of these threads</a> and revealed it has "opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within Jurassic World Evolution 3." The studio reaffirmed this in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Watcher</a>, where it's confirmed that Generative AI was removed "following some initial feedback" and that the game will still make its announced release following this change. The AI disclaimer is also no longer on its Steam page.</p><p>The use of generative AI is currently a very hot topic in the video game industry. It has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">used by studios like Activision</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">developers like Masahiro Sakurai</a> believe it has uses in game development. Generally, players don't like when generative AI is used in games, though, with this Jurassic World Evolution 3 backlash simply being the latest example.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21.</p>
