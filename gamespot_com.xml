                <p>This week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> update, the game's first in a month, brought with it a major goodie for a lot of the folks who play on a PlayStation console: a new PlayStation Plus-exclusive skin. The new Emerald Gamer pack is included at no extra cost with any level of PS Plus membership, and can be claimed in the PlayStation Store on PS4 and PS5, in the PS App, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01922_00-PSCP300000000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the web</a>. In order to unlock the skin in-game, you will need to actually load up Fortnite on a PlayStation device at least once after claiming it from the store. Once you've done so, the skin will be usable on any platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533112"></a><figcaption>All PS+ members can claim the Emerald Gamer pack now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4533112-theemeraldgamer.jpg"></figure><p>This new pack includes the brand-new <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18187" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sage</a> skin, as well as a matching back bling and pickaxe. While most PS Plus skins have been redone versions of existing skins, like how the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=16683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shinji</a> skin in the previous PS Plus pack was a new variation of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=588" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Master Key</a> from the Chapter 1 Season 8 battle pass, Sage is actually an original character design. The Emerald Gamer pack will remain in the PlayStation Store until September 23.</p><p>The Emerald Gamer pack is the 30th PlayStation Plus pack for Fortnite thus far, and none of the items included in any of the previous packs have ever been sold in the item shop, so these items are generally considered to be exclusive despite not explicitly being stated as such.</p><p>Sage is not the only "free" skin currently available in Fortnite. Players who link a Lego account with their Epic account before August 31 will receive a free <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=17907" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">First Order Stormtrooper</a> from Star Wars, and anyone who redeems a Fortnite or Epic Games Store gift card before the end of 2026 (yes, 2026) will receive the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=17794" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghost Monks</a> skin as an added bonus.</p>
