                <p dir="ltr">It's more or less agreed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-0/" data-ref-id="5000-295563">Yakuza 0</a> is really good--many will even say the best in the whole series. But with the Switch 2's launch lineup being somewhat sparse, Sega (and Nintendo, which has timed exclusivity on this edition) are likely hoping players want to complement their Mario Karting, Cyberpunk 2077ing, and Street Fighting with a hard-hitting open-world adventure. But is it worth it? It really depends.</p><p dir="ltr">At $50, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is cheaper than many of the other Switch 2 launch games, and there's a lot to do here between the lengthy, dual-protagonist narrative and the surprisingly involving minigames. You can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and that's not even taking into account the new content.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Switch 2's Yakuza 0 Director's Cut Is An Upgraded Version Aimed At Old And New Fans</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major difference is the addition of new voice and subtitle tracks. Your choice of voice actors is down to personal preference, but for me, the Japanese ones are too iconic to switch away from. Chinese and English voice tracks have been recorded for the entire game. If you're a series veteran, you'll also notice that the demo cinematic features the Japanese rock song "Bubble" by Shounan no Kaze--a song featured in the original Yakuza 0's Japanese release but excised overseas. It's back, it's rockin', and it sets the stage for a grand old time in 1988 Bubble Era Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">At the title screen, there's a mode selectable right off the bat: Red Light Raid, which has you and up to four online or offline companions beating up waves of hooligans for fun and profit. I was intrigued by this mode, hoping it might serve as a callback to classic multiplayer arcade brawlers--some of which were made by Sega itself. What I actually got was somewhat underwhelming: You pick a character out of a massive roster (many of which require a good amount of in-game cash to unlock) and take them into battle with up to four player- or CPU-controlled companions. You'll pick a challenge, fight wave after wave of enemies, sometimes encountering a boss fight, before dealing with a final boss. Finishing a challenge run earns you lots of sweet, sweet yen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751" data-ratio="0.56246961594555" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut looks on par with the original game on PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can do all the fun head-cracking, chest-smashing moves here as you can in the base game (though both Kiryu and Majima require you to pick one fighting style and stick with it). It's a way to play as characters who are otherwise uncontrollable in the base game, which is nice. But overall it feels undercooked: Characters vary wildly in usefulness, and the sessions can devolve into messy chaos, especially in dark settings and on the Switch 2's handheld mode. It's obvious this game's combat, which frequently takes place in narrow streets, corridors, and cluttered rooms, wasn't built for multiplayer originally—and it frequently feels crowded and hard to get your bearings even on more open arenas. There’s a mix of character models and moves mostly mashed together from this game and others in the series, including a lot of barely-seen NPCs. Still, if you can get your friend group together in a GameChat channel as you play, you'll have some fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphically, I didn't notice any major changes or upgrades compared to the PS4 original--the textures look mostly identical and the character models seem to be a 1:1 port, though the Switch 2 version does include 4K support.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752" data-ratio="0.56149732620321" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut adds five brand-new cutscenes to the game's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger selling points has been the addition of five brand-new cutscenes--almost a half-hour's worth. I got the impression that these new scenes were meant to give some additional screen time to characters who fell by the wayside in the original, along with additional screentime for the Kiryu and Nishikiyama duo. They’re certainly a nice addition, though how much you’ll get from them depends on how invested in the cast you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade--but the biggest elephant in the room is that the original Yakuza 0 has <em>frequently</em> gone on very deep discount on Steam and elsewhere; during some sales, you could pick this saga up for well under $10. Even at a lower-than-average price of $50, this poses the question: Do the additional cutscenes, voice/subtitle languages, and other extra content in Director's Cut make up for that big price hike? For me, no--I like this series a lot, but I'm not hungry enough for new Yakuza to want to pay a huge premium for some extras that ultimately don't add all <em>that</em> much. But if you can't get enough of that crime drama, English isn't your first language, or you just have to have an English or Chinese voice track, then go ahead and grab it--it's a fantastic time.</p>

                <p>Though Microsoft never announced an official Xbox handheld device, there were rumors about how such a device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">might factor into the company's next-gen console plans</a>. Those plans are continuing to evolve, it seems, as a new report said Microsoft's own Xbox handheld is "essentially canceled."</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, citing insiders, said such a device is no longer going forward. This follows on from a report at the end of May that suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-pauses-development-on-xbox-handheld/1100-6531934/" data-ref-id="1100-6531934">plans for an Xbox handheld were sidelined.</a></p><p>The Verge's report added that Microsoft remains bullish on the idea of making "next-gen Xbox hardware," but perhaps not in the way people think. "We'll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SOKm9dDOSC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer alluded to a closer collaboration between PC and console in a recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox podcast interview.</a> "This is the tightest collaboration I've seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company," he said. Spencer also mentioned how Windows PC is an open platform and that he believes, if managed properly, a PC can be considered "as a game console."</p><p>While Microsoft may not develop its own dedicated gaming handheld device, the company is working with third-party devices like the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Rog Ally handhelds from Asus.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the company's plans for handheld devices going forward.</p><p>In February 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p>The new Xbox Rog Ally devices launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>

and Xbox Series X|S. This means that the next mainline entry is making a proper leap over to current-gen systems, leaving last-gen consoles behind.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_story">Resident Evil: Requiem story</h2><p>Requiem stars a new character in the form of FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft--the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft--who is tasked with exploring a series of recent murders that were committed at the Wrenwood Hotel. Ashcroft has a personal connection to this location as this is the site where her mother was murdered, and Capcom says that players can expect "a new era of survival-horror," amplified by technological advancements in the RE Engine that powers the game.</p><p>The interesting thing about Resident Evil Outbreak was that the playable characters had been infected with one of Umbrella Corporation's viruses, making the experience that much more challenging in this 2003 multiplayer co-op game. Alyssa appears to have survived the events of the game--some of her journalistic work was referenced in later Resident Evil games--and it'll be interesting to see if Requiem links back to Outbreak.</p><p>For the first time in a <em>long </em>time, Resident Evil is also returning to Raccoon City. The iconic city was leveled with an experimental thermobaric missile strike toward the end of Resident Evil 2, and since then, it has been a desolate crater that has remained unexplored in other Resident Evil sequels. The reveal trailer for the game teased a few familiar locations, like the police department that is barely standing amidst the charred ruins of the devastated city.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_gameplay">Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay</h2><p>Your average Resident Evil protagonist knows how to handle a firearm, but in comparison, Grace isn't as skilled. While she's still capable of defending herself, Capcom's description for the game suggests that fleeing from danger is the best path forward. The game combines "deeply terrifying aspects of psychological horror with pulse-pounding action that franchise fans know and love," Capcom says.</p><p>One other interesting tidbit is that you can choose to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-will-terrify-from-multiple-camera-angles/1100-6532355/">play Requiem from multiple angles</a>. The game will feature both first-person and third-person camera angles, allowing you to experience the story from either a traditional Resident Evil perspective or a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">first-person viewpoint that has defined modern entries in the series</a>.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_screens">Resident Evil: Requiem screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512634" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512634"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512635,1300-4512636,1300-4512637,1300-4512638,1300-4512639,1300-4512640,1300-4512641" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg"></figure>

<section><p>The Lumines series is getting a major glow-up--literally and metaphorically.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After playing 20 minutes of Lumines Arise, the team from Enhance presented me with a difficult decision. "We have another 20 or so minutes left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time asking us some questions, or would you like to play a bit more?" And as much as I wanted to jump straight into interviews and pick the minds of the folks who brought us Humanity, Tetris Effect, and Rez Infinite, I found myself betrayed by my own childlike glee.</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you mind if I do just a couple more levels?" I asked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in that moment--when the part of me that simply loves games overtook the part of me that tries her hardest to maintain a writer's sensibilities--that I realized I <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with Lumines Arise. And though of course I took time to chat with game and art director Takashi Ishihara and creative producer Mark MacDonald and enjoyed every minute of it, I left the preview event wishing that somehow the next entry in the Lumines series was back at my hotel, loaded up on my Steam Deck, and waiting for me to get back to playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't to say I didn't get enough time to get a sense of how Lumines Arise is shaping up. During the preview event, I played through a pre-made playlist of four songs followed by <em>another</em> playlist with two additional songs after I proved overly voracious. With each track lasting around four minutes, this made for around 30 minutes of Lumines Arise goodness. From what I gathered, it seems as though the mode I played essentially allows players to construct their own setlists by selecting songs from the game's main story, referred to as Journey mode. As such, I encountered the songs out of order and without the context that I assume would be provided in story mode. And yet, that didn't stop them from being visually delightful, memorable, and, most importantly, a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721"></a><figcaption>A golden-hued level that sees players arrange dark blue orbs and yellow squares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with Lumines, the overall gameplay feels very similar to Tetris: Blocks fall down, you rotate and place them to help clear the board, and "topping out" spells game over. However, whereas Tetris sees you place tetrominos of various shapes down to help form lines that then clear your board, Lumines focuses entirely on squares. Each construct you are given is 2x2 consisting of up to two different types of blocks; as you place them down, your goal is to form squares (2x2 or greater) consisting of the same block type.</p><p dir="ltr">Once a square is formed, you have until the vertical "Time Line" sweeps across the board to add to it, making the seconds between a square's construction and that sweep a rush to extend your block to a 3x3, 4x4, and so on. Though it doesn't directly correlate to the track's RPM, the Time Line helps emphasize the musicality of the game and builds up your internal rhythm. Arise also gets a new twist with its Burst meter, which slowly fills up over time and can then be used to lock a square to your grid for a few passes of the Time Line, allowing you to add to it for longer and subsequently clear more of the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this is all relatively simple to grasp, it's certainly harder in execution. And interestingly, the more I <em>thought </em>about what I was doing in Lumines Arise, the trickier things seemed to become. Fortunately, everything about Arise--from its music and visuals to its gameplay--encourages you to enter the same trance-like flow state it inhabits. Everything is fluid, stylish, and hypnotizing. And yet, there is an undeniable tension that comes hand-in-hand with these sorts of puzzle games--the ones that can grow overwhelming, constricting, and unwieldy with just a few poorly placed tiles. Ultimately, though, all this makes for wonderful juxtaposition that is not just a core part of Lumines Arise mechanically, but narratively as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712"></a><figcaption>A darker level that is largely silent and features empty boxes and clunky, metal box fans.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't play Arise's Journey mode, one of the handful of levels I did play was notably darker in tone than the others, offering a look at places the game's narrative might go. In place of pulsing lights and electronic pop was oppressive silence and mechanical groans; rather than placing down flashing circles and boxes, I was given harsh, metal box fans and hollow white boxes to try to form into squares. Within a minute, I felt incredibly tense, and told the team as much with a nervous laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">According to creative producer Mark MacDonald, this was entirely the point, as Arise's story focuses on "life's highs and lows, and how we balance the good with the bad." Naturally, actually tackling this theme and conveying these messages is a bit difficult due to the game's lack of a written narrative. Though having songs with lyrics in the game can act as a sort of "cheat," MacDonald laughed, as it gives players a more clear sense of how they are meant to feel, lyrics can often be a bit abstract or metaphorical. Atmosphere, then, is largely how the team makes this happen, and just as Lumines influenced how Enhance constructed Tetris Effect's environments and storytelling, the team said they looked to Tetris Effect to shape Arise.</p><p dir="ltr">"A challenge of our games is that we are telling stories in abstract ways and in ways only we have really done," MacDonald said. "Lumines informed Tetris Effect, and now we're seeing things circle as Tetris Effect shapes Lumines Arise."</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after this interaction, the eerie, monochromatic level started to unweave itself and came to an end. I was then greeted by two dancing chameleons, having the time of their lives, while a fast-paced song thumped away in the background. These levels are indeed an abstract and interesting take on life's "highs and lows," but they absolutely rule, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711"></a><figcaption>A funky level that features two chameleons and circles and squares to arrange.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As I bobbed my head along to the music and got back into the swing of things, game and art director Takashi Ishihara was delighted that the atmosphere he and the team had constructed was doing precisely what was intended.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some people cried when they finished Tetris Effect, and we were blown away by that response," Ishihara said. "I think people who have a deep connection to art and music--who are connected to their emotions and sensitive to atmosphere--will really respond to [Lumines Arise]."</p><p>That said, I suspect that even those coming to Lumines Arise purely for a delightful new puzzle game will still be plenty impressed. It's fun, engaging, <em>slightly</em> tense, visually spectacular, and has the same delightful fluidity that Enhance is known for delivering. All in all, I can't wait to spend more time with it once it hits PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

                <p>It's been almost a decade since the original Postal was given a modern remake in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-redux-pc-release-date-announced-ps4-edition/1100-6439661/" data-ref-id="1100-6439661">Postal Redux</a>. Now, it's time for 2003's Postal 2 to get the same treatment with Postal 2 Redux, "a ground‐up overhaul" of the original game.</p><p>Postal 2 Redux is in development with Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors, with a Kickstarter campaign slated to begin later this summer. According to the announcement, the revitalized game grew out of an initial attempt to bring Postal 2 to VR. Now, the original assets will be recreated in Unity with "enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‐up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNUeNiAplI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzNUeNiAplI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the announcement teaser doesn't have much to show off, some of the features planned for Portal 2 Redux include the ability to pet Champ the dog, as well as the addition of dynamic lighting, more refined crowds, fully breakable interiors, and an open world that can be explored without any loading screens.</p><p>According to the developers, the plan is to bring Postal 2 Redux to PC, macOS, Linux rigs, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Switch 1 or 2. However, the team notes that the final platform lineup has yet to be finalized and it may depend on stretch goals achieved through Kickstarter as well as approval from the console-makers in question.</p><p>The Kickstarter pre-launch page for Postal 2 Redux is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently online</a>, but the campaign doesn't have an official start date yet. There's no word about whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-iii-review/1900-6348436/" data-ref-id="1900-6348436">Postal 3</a> may get remake as well. That game was so poorly received among Postal fans in 2011 that Running With Scissors later retconned <a href="https://postal.fandom.com/wiki/Postal_III" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Postal 3 as a non-canonical game</a>. The most recent title in the franchise was Postal 4: No Regerts, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/" data-ref-id="1900-6417864">debuted to bad reviews</a> in 2022.</p>
