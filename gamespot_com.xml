It has a smaller size that makes it easier to lug around, and Samsung says that this is one of the toughest tablets that it has ever built. One thing to note is that it has a user-replaceable battery, so if you're going to be stuck somewhere without any electricity for several days, you can always bring a few spare batteries to keep this powered. Beyond that, it makes for a good lightweight tablet.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone/dp/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone\/dp\/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone/dp/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone/dp/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone\/dp\/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Keyboard-Included-American-Moonstone/dp/B0DJDPTJBB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$730 (was $775)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li>Screen size: 12.4 inches</li><li>Storage: 256 GB</li></ul><p>Samsung's flagship s10+ tablet is one of the best Android devices around.

                <p>Another new expansion for The Sims 4 has arrived, and Enchanted by Nature shakes up EA's long-running life sim in some big ways. That includes the introduction of a brand-new Fairy occult type, new methods for living off the land instead of in a house, and--most relevant to this article--an entirely new way for your Sims to get sick, called Ailments.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the standard illnesses in The Sims 4 don't pop up that often and are easily cured with generic medicine, Ailments are a whole new category of affliction that require specific cures--or help from a magical being with the ability to fix Ailments. Fortunately, Ailments are more annoying than dangerous--they really aren't severe enough to kill a Sim on their own--but their effects can be so disruptive that it's usually better to deal with them sooner than later.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</a><ul><li><a href="#What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</a></li><li><a href="#List_of_ailments">List of ailments</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530514"></a><figcaption>A Sim with an Ailment is usually easy to spot, since some symptoms will be visible on their skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4530514-thesims4solvingailmentsandwhatnot.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_Ailments_work">How Ailments work</h2><p dir="ltr">Ailments are contagious illnesses that can be caused by catching them from another Sim, being afflicted with one by a Fairy, or by being emotionally out of balance. The contagion factor is real, as hanging out in the same place as an infected Sim has a very good chance of giving your Sim an infection, too. And it's not just direct contact that'll get you--as with real illnesses, interacting with stuff that a sick person has touched can get your Sim sick too.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, being out of balance emotionally--this is indicated by the new balance meter in the Simology tab--makes it likely that your Sim will simply develop an Ailment without any extra help, but it also makes your Sim more vulnerable to catching something from another Sim. Likewise, being <em>in</em> balance fortifies your Sim against catching an Ailment naturally or from another Sim. Think of the emotional balance meter as a measure of your Sim's immune system.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="What_to_do_when_your_Sim_has_an_Ailment">What to do when your Sim has an Ailment</h3><p dir="ltr">There are several different ways that you can deal with your Sim's Ailment when they catch something. The first is to do nothing and let the Ailment run its course. While that may sound silly on its face, some of the ailments <em>do</em> have positive side effects--like Luck Magnet, which makes the infected Sim lucky by stealing luck from the other Sims around them. Gnome Lure, likewise, causes sentient garden gnomes to spawn like during Harvestfest. While I normally really don't like the gnomes, they've got a whole new use in the Enchanted by Nature expansion--Fairy Sims can enchant them with Fairy Dust to bring them to life.</p><p dir="ltr">So if you think the upside of the Ailment is worth the trouble, you can let it play itself out. Otherwise, there are four methods for ending an ailment immediately, all of which are relatively simple:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Use your phone to visit a naturopath, who will cure your Sim for 1,500 Simoleons</li><li dir="ltr">Ask any fairy to cure the Ailment--though fairies <em>cannot</em> cure <em>themselves</em> through magic.</li><li dir="ltr">"Manifest" a cure by visiting Moondrop Spring in the Everdew neighborhood of Innisgreen</li><li dir="ltr">Make your own cure at an apothecary table</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Crafting_your_own_Ailment_cures">Crafting your own Ailment cures</h2><p dir="ltr">Crafting Ailment cures is a relatively easy process because they require only common ingredients that you can find without much difficulty, That's because Ailment cures are the first things your Sim learns to create when they learn the apothecary skill--the Ailment cures require level 1 or 2, so there's no grind involved. Which is a very good thing because even though Fairies can magically cure <em>other</em> Sims, they can't do that with Ailments that they themselves are afflicted with.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain the apothecary skill, a Sim just need to use any apothecary table to "Study Apothecary Cures," and then after a moment they'll be able to craft some Ailment cures--and since the rest only require skill level 2, it'll take just a few more moments of messing around with the apothecary table before your Sim can craft the rest of them.</p><p dir="ltr">And since these cures are low-level recipes, their ingredients are incredibly easy to find by casually foraging anywhere by clicking on any patch of grass in any Sims 4 world, or by purchasing the ingredients using the option on the apothecary table. None of the ingredients are expensive, so buying them shouldn't be a problem for folks who want to get right to it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="List_of_ailments">List of ailments</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Burning Passion:</strong> Makes the infected Sim very flirty, and also very likely to occasionally burn nearby objects</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Creation Impulse:</strong> Gives a Dazed moodlet, while also making the infected Sim better at crafting things.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Emotional Void:</strong> Dampens the infected Sim's emotions, and will also passively do the same to any nearby Sims.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gnome Lure:</strong> Makes gnomes spawn near the infected Sim</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greenie Meanie:</strong> Makes the infected Sim simultaneously very good at gardening and very cranky.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Luck Magnet:</strong> Makes the infected Sim lucky at the expense of those around them.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Simoleon Fever:</strong> Makes the infected Sim cough up money.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sonic Sinuses:</strong> Their sneezes are so powerful that they occasionally break things, but the Sim has improved handiness and can fix things easier.</li></ul>

This week, it kicked things off with an introduction to Vex, a new Siren who taps into her deadly abilities at a fairly stressful, and very unfortunate, time.</p><p dir="ltr">In a gameplay overview, we get a taste for how Vex will differ from other Sirens from the Borderlands games. Sirens are a special (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">very fun</a>) kind of being in the series that are able to tap into psychic abilities and are marked by glowing tattoos. Vex is much the same, but uses her newfound powers to provide her with a squad of minions.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Vex the Siren | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Vex stands apart from previous playable Sirens by focusing heavily on minions that she can summon, transforming her role into a kind of necromancer/pet class. One of her skill trees entirely focuses on a large alien cat familiar called Trouble, which Vex can summon and teleport around the battlefield. Many of the additional skills and modifiers on the tree augment Trouble's capabilities in battle, allowing them to soak up more damage, taunt enemies, or even explode.</p><p dir="ltr">As a Siren, Vex possesses many other abilities too, including one that allows her to send out a blast of phase energy, sprout some gnarly-looking wings, conjure a little orb/turret, and blast enemies with a projectile from her free hand, all in one fell swoop. For her final of three Siren action skills, Vex can summon copies of herself to do long-range DPS or project a psychic reaper that gets up close to enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">For the curious, you can already sneak a peek at Vex's <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/vex/" rel="nofollow ">full skill trees</a> and get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDE_Jn2K5I&amp;ab_channel=Borderlands">deeper look at some of her skills</a>. You know, just in case you want to start prepping your builds for launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgZvUMgtSs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BzgZvUMgtSs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Gearbox released an animated short called Purple Friday that fills in some of the blanks regarding Vex's backstory. In true Borderlands fashion, the short, which comes in at just over three minutes, is exceptionally bloody and chock full of gags. In it, Vex works a retail job at the series' equivalent of a big-box store when she taps into her Siren powers. Along the way, she falls for a cute guy, is threatened by a customer, and even manages to sneak in what appears to be a joke at Borderlands 3's expense in the middle of the gory affair.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fun little peek at Borderlands 4's world, and there appears to be more of it on the horizon. Gearbox is set to roll out similar videos for the rest of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">playable vault hunters</a>, who can be seen at the tail end of the short around a campfire with Vex.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 launches September 12 and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 later in 2025.</p>

The Forgotten Wisdom affix, which grants bonus XP, has also been adjusted to make it so XP motes dropped by enemies will now split experience between party members instead of only granting experience to the player who picked it up. Additionally, the maximum number of motes that can spawn in a dungeon has significantly increased, while the frequency has been slightly reduced. Each mote grants more XP as well, though motes will no longer spawn from monsters summoned by other monsters or in Horadric Strongrooms.</p><p dir="ltr">Other areas that will now have increased rewards include tiers of The Pit above tier 70, which will now grant additional Artificer's Stones on completion. Legion events will also reward more salvage materials and Forgotten Souls when completed on Torment difficulties. Arcana, a new seasonal component used to modify Horadric spells, are also now picked up automatically.</p><p dir="ltr">As for class balance changes, there are a few buffs for each class, with Barbarian receiving the most adjustments. Barbarian abilities like Hammer of the Ancients, Double Swing, Upheaval, and even Whirlwind are getting some significant buffs. Necromancer, alternatively, received the fewest changes, with only a 25% increase to the golem-damage sacrifice bonus from the Hulking Monstrosity passive.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full patch notes below. In other Diablo 4 news, a hotfix on July 9 fixed an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-an-infinite-damage-bug-so-easy-anyone-can-do-it/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">infinite-damage bug</a> for Sorcerer that was so easy just about anyone could replicate it, thankfully limiting the bug's impact.
