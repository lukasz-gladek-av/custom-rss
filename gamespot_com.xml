Later this month, NetEase is debuting a new game mode and a new map that brings Season 3's enemy, Knull, to the forefront.</p><p>The new map is located on Klyntar, the planet of the Symbiotes, and it's called Throne of Knull. It's connected to the Venom Spire that runs through the core of the planet and features Knull himself still trapped in his throne. But perhaps not for long, as he absorbs Phoenix's flames in the first video of the map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P44x3oxvhFY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P44x3oxvhFY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Throne of Knull will also be one of the settings for the game's new mode, Resource Rumble. Starting on August 21, Resource Rumble will pit teams against one other as they attempt to gather enough resource points to claim victory. However, teams can steal victory from the jaws of defeat by robbing their rivals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGfp8UJDpdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGfp8UJDpdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>NetEase also teased an event called Ancient Powers Awaken that launches on August 21 and will offer new epic rewards and a free Old Man Strange costume for Doctor Strange. There will also be new improvements to matchmaking and ranking systems soon. Those adjustments will be announced on August 21 on Marvel Rivals' social media channels.</p><p>Earlier this month, NetEase announced plans to target toxic players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-record-all-voice-chat-to-target-toxic-players/1100-6533630/" data-ref-id="1100-6533630">by recording all voice chat in Marvel Rivals</a>. NetEase has also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-new-character-arrivals-wont-rely-on-mcu-release-schedules/1100-6533078/" data-ref-id="1100-6533078">it's not reliant on MCU schedules</a> to introduce new heroes, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-could-have-original-characters-in-the-future/1100-6534040/" data-ref-id="1100-6534040">may even introduce original characters</a> in the future.</p>
