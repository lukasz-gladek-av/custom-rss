                <p>It is going to be a big, big week for Nintendo and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, as Nintendo has confirmed it will follow up the April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 Direct with two more days of livestreams focused on games for the console.</p><p>Nintendo's Treehouse Live broadcast series returns April 3 and 4 for what's being called a "Nintendo Switch 2 presentation featuring hands-on gameplay of Nintendo Switch 2 games." These Treehouse broadcasts will begin at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on April 3 and 4.</p><p>If the Treehouse Live events for Switch 2 games are similar to previous ones, fans can expect Nintendo to go deep. Previous Treehouse Live events featured Nintendo developers and designers discussing games at length while showing off gameplay. In short, you won't want to miss them. It's not clear how long these Treehouse Live events will run for, however.</p><p>Given that Nintendo is dedicating two days to follow-up broadcasts for the Switch 2 event with these Treehouse livestreams, it's reasonable to assume Nintendo has <em>a lot </em>in store for the 60-minute April 2 event.</p><p>That makes sense, of course, given the console is coming out this year and we still don't know much about it or its games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">In terms of titles</a>, many are expecting to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart 9</a> and a new 3D Mario game, among others.</p><p>As for when the Switch 2 could release, the latest scuttlebutt suggests <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launching-in-june-with-three-phase-rollout-for-games-report/1100-6530366/" data-ref-id="1100-6530366">the system may release in June, priced at $400 or more.</a> Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Director Jared Hess' A Minecraft Movie is what the world needs right now, according to stars Jack Black and Jason Momoa. Speaking at the movie's premiere, Black quoted Burt Bacharach's 1965 song "What The World Needs Now," and added, "We've got to work together, my god."</p><p>"There's so much violence and war and hatred. And that's what I love about this movie--there's a lot of love in it and there's a lot of creativity. There is some anger and violence too, but in the end it's about friendship and working together to make [the world] a better place," Black told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jason-momoa-jack-black-minecraft-movie-jennifer-coolidge-1236175713/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p><p>Momoa, meanwhile, said "everyone needs to escape a little bit right now," and A Minecraft Movie could be a solution for them.</p><p>"It's nice to sit back and have a really fun adventure and giggle and laugh," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Momoa said he's hopeful A Minecraft Movie is well-received and performs well at the box office so he can make a sequel.</p><p>"We won't let you down. We worked our ass off for you, and I think we brought the world to life. I think everybody's gonna love it," he said. "There's so much more to tell; I just hope the fans will be delighted and let us make more."</p><p>A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters this Friday, April 4, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-minecraft-movie-could-compare-to-other-video-game-films-at-the-box-office/1100-6530115/" data-ref-id="1100-6530115">it's expected to perform about as well as Sonic the Hedgehog 3 did in the US.</a> April also sees the release of HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 (April 13) and then Sony's Until Dawn movie (April 25), so it's a stacked month for video game adaptations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-social-media-reviews-to-a-minecraft-movie-are-in-heres-what-people-are-saying/1100-6530503/" data-ref-id="1100-6530503">first social media reviews for A Minecraft Movie have begun to appear online</a>, with people calling it "appalling" and "awkward," as well as "hilarious" and "sharp." That seems to be in keeping with tradition for movies from Hess, whose previous releases, including Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, divided audiences.</p>

The images are supposedly taken from the Star Wars strategy game developed by Bit Reactor. The studio was founded by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-xcom-civilization-devs-have-formed-a-new-studio/1100-6499799/" data-ref-id="1100-6499799">former XCOM developers</a> and partnered with Respawn Entertainment on the project. </p><p>Found by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, these images were spotted in a Bit Reactor artist's portfolio. They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is "Bruno" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Some of the screenshots show gameplay where Mandalorians and a droid take cover while others depict the user interface. One shows what looks like the hub area, called Kafrene Mining Colony.</p><p>As these images are over a year old, it's also possible that the final release could look drastically different. The official <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars website</a> states that there will be a first look at Respawn and Bit Reactor's project during Star Wars Celebration in Japan on April 19.</p><p>This Star Wars project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/1100-6499936/" data-ref-id="1100-6499936">not the only one in the works right now</a>.
