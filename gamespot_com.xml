Pass through the Backward box, then follow that toy ambulance through the room while bypassing the Forward box altogether.</p><p>As the toy ambulance reaches the Out of Bounds gap, walk atop it and ride it across to the other side.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4539024-1729740_20250726170908_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4539024" data-ratio="0.5618305744888" data-width="2054" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4539024-1729740_20250726170908_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4539024"></a><figcaption>You'll have to ride this toy ambulance across the Out of Bounds gap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4539024-1729740_20250726170908_1.png"></figure><p>If you mess up and find the toy ambulance is lost on the other side of the Out of Bounds gap, just use the Forward box to bring it back to you and start over.</p><p>Enter the door ahead and turn left.
