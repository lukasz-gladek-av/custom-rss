                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> will soon add the ability to leash together mobs to each other or objects, opening up new possibilities for how players engage with the game's voxel-based world.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unleash-your-imagination" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> on the Minecraft website, the ability to lead a single mob with a leash has existed for some time. The upcoming changes to the feature, however, will greatly expand what can be done with leashes, allowing players to tie mobs together and attach them to a wider variety of objects.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477072" data-ratio="0.56244131455399" data-width="1065" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477072"></a><figcaption>An example of how leashes can be used to turn Happy Ghasts into hot air balloons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog gives examples of leashing horses together or using leashes to turn friendly Happy Ghasts into hot air balloons. While some leash functionality, like the ability to tie a leash to a fence, isn't new, changes to how they work are. It will be easier to add and remove leashes from knots, and players looking to remove one particular mob from a leashed group can use shears to do so. Keep in mind, players can't leash together other players or use shears to mess with someone else's leashes.</p><p dir="ltr">All the new leashing functionality is available for testing now for those using Minecraft: Java Edition, with testing coming to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition realms on Xbox, Windows, Android, and iOS soon, developer Mojang said. A release date for when the feature would come to all users hasn't been announced.</p><p dir="ltr">To test the feature, players will need to enable snapshots for Minecraft: Java Edition and install it via the Minecraft launcher. For those looking to test on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, players will need to opt in to preview/beta and download those specific test versions. Mojang notes that playing test versions can corrupt a player's world, so those interested in testing out the feature should backup their world or run them in a different save folder from their main world.</p><p dir="ltr">While Mojang continues to deliver new features to Minecraft, A Minecraft Movie is breaking records at the box office, recently becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-movie-is-now-the-no-2-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-of-all-time/1100-6530830/" data-ref-id="1100-6530830">second-highest-grossing video game film of all time</a> after The Super Mario Bros. Movie. While a sequel has not been officially announced, it certainly sounds like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-sounds-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6530854/" data-ref-id="1100-6530854">A Minecraft Movie 2 is in the works</a>, with a Warner Bros. executive saying planning for a sequel would begin imminently.</p>

While this isn't a brand-new feature, it's been relatively well-hidden among the gaming community.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1jycup7/comment/mmxdv4f/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, user trotski94 laid out how to see how much money players have invested into Steam, and it provides the exact dollar amount--a much more accurate number than simply just trying to tally up the items in your purchase history.</p><p>Click on "Help" and then "Steam Support." Go to "My Account," then "Data Related To Your Steam Account," and finally "External Funds Used." The list will show several different categories.</p><p>"TotalSpend" is the total amount of external funds applied to a player's account and is used to determine if it's a "Limited User Account," meaning that the owner has not spent at least $5 within the Steam store.</p><p>"OldSpend" is the amount of external funds applied before Friday, April 17, 2015. "PWSpend" involves accounts linked to Perfect World, which is Valve's publishing partner for CS:GO and Dota 2 in China. It's the approximate USD value of funds applied from Perfect World. "ChinaSpend" refers to applied external funds in Steam China, and is the reported total in RMB, China's currency.</p><p>In other recent Steam news, an early-access game called Velve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-after-launching-in-early-access-this-new-steam-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6530851/" data-ref-id="1100-6530851">shut down mere days after it launched</a>.</p>
