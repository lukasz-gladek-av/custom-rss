                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> revolves around your ability to discover new resources and craft items using those resources. You can craft blocks for building a base, gear to fend off mobs, and weapons and tools to progress into more advanced biomes on the map. However, most of the items you're able to make in Hytale are crafted at different workbenches.</p><p>Workbenches are like Crafting Tables from Minecraft, but Hytale is different in that certain workbenches can craft specific items and materials. Whether you're playing solo or in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-hytale/1100-6537377/" data-ref-id="1100-6537377">Hytale multiplayer</a>, if you want to craft all sorts of items in Hytale, you'll need to know the recipes for every single workbench in the game.</p><h2 id="How_to_unlock_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to unlock workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>When you start Hytale, you won't be able to immediately make all of these crafting stations. Instead, you have to unlock your first workbench, which is done by using the crafting recipe for the regular workbench (3x Stones, 4x Tree Trunks).</p><p>This is done by going to your inventory by pressing "Tab" and selecting the workbench from the crafting menu. With the required resources in your inventory, you can click "Craft," and your first workbench is now ready to be placed down.</p><p>A regular workbench is how you craft all other workbenches in Hytale, so you always want to ensure you have one readily accessible. Fortunately, all it takes is any Stone and Tree Trunks to craft, which are always around you, regardless of what biome you're wandering around. Oak Logs are likely to be the first Tree Trunks you can get after leaving the spawn cave.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_all_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to craft all workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>In total, there are eight craftable workbenches in Hytale, and each one has a different use when it comes to crafting certain items, materials, etc. To have a fully functioning base that can produce any kind of item in the game, you'll want to ensure you have a spot for all eight workbenches.</p><p>Of course, knowing what the workbenches are is only half the battle; you'll also need to know how to craft them and what is craftable at the workbench itself. Below, you can see every workbench, its crafting recipe, and what the workbench is able to produce.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Workbench Name</th><th scope="col">Crafting Use</th><th scope="col">Crafting Recipe</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Workbench</td><td>Starter tools and weapons</td><td>3x Stones<br>4x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Armorer's Workbench</td><td>Armor</td><td>2x Copper Ingot<br>5x Stones<br>10x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Builder's Workbench</td><td>Base-building items</td><td>3x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Farmer's Workbench</td><td>Food/crop items</td><td>6x Tree Trunks<br>20x Plant Fiber</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist's Workbench</td><td>Potions and healing supplies</td><td>5x Gold Ingot<br>10x Bone Fragment<br>10x Venom Sac<br>20x Stones</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture Workbench</td><td>Base furniture and decorations</td><td><p>4x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</p></td></tr><tr><td>Arcanist's Workbench</td><td>Teleporters and magical items</td><td>10x Thorium Ingots<br>20x Essence of the Void<br>30x Linen Scraps</td></tr><tr><td>Salvager's Workbench</td><td>Used to salvage and destroy items</td><td>5x Tree Trunks<br>5x Stones<br>6x Iron Ingots</td></tr></tbody></table><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460" data-ratio="0.53686274509804" data-width="2550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460"></a><figcaption>Some of the craftable Workbenches in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg"></figure><p>There are also four other crafting stations in Hytale that aren't clearly marked as workbenches, but they perform very similarly and are able to craft additional items. You'll want these stations in your base as well, so here's what they are and how to make them:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Station Name</th><th scope="col">Crafting Use</th><th scope="col">Crafting Recipe</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blacksmith's Anvil</td><td>Upgrade or repair weapons</td><td>2x Copper Ingots<br>5x Stones<br>10x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Chef's Stove</td><td>Cooking food</td><td>2x Copper Ingots<br>5x Stones<br>10x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Furnace</td><td>Smelting ore into ingots</td><td><p>6x Tree Trunks<br>6x Stones</p></td></tr><tr><td>Tanning Rack</td><td>Tanning hides into leather</td><td><p>3x Stone<br>3x Light Hide<br>6x Tree Trunks</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
