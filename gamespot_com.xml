          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Launch Week Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Borderlands 4 will cost $70 when it launches, which is notable because there was a period of time when Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford claimed he did not know the price, prompting fears that it could be $80. Pitchford stoked the conversation around pricing by saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">"real fans" would find a way to come up with $80 if that was the case.</a></p><p>Pitchford is so confident in Borderlands 4's pricing strategy that he recently said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">believes the game would be "worth it" at five times the price of entry.</a></p><p>While the standard edition is priced at $70, 2K and Gearbox are offering multiple more expensive editions of the game, including a $100 deluxe edition, a $130 super deluxe edition, and a $150 collector's edition.

                <p>XP has been a regular topic of conversation among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players during Chapter 6 Season 4, as Epic Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-xp-gains-are-reportedly-slower-in-chapter-6-season-4/1100-6533768/" data-ref-id="1100-6533768">apparently slashed how quickly most folks will level up</a> just by playing normally. Since this season is a month longer than last season was, it's not a particularly surprising change. Fortunately, Fortnite is easing the burden a bit by offering double XP all weekend. The boost will last until Monday, September 8 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p><p>Double XP weekends aren't a very common thing in Fortnite. Typically, when Epic wants to help players gain XP faster, it adds limited-time event quests with simple objectives that are easy to complete in Battle Royale, Reload, or whatever other mode the company wants to promote. Fortnite's most recent double XP weekend event like this one happened back in March.</p><p>The double XP is only one of the things Epic changed for this weekend. Blitz Royale is having a Golden Llamageddon event, where the map will be filled with special gold llama pinatas full of top-tier loot. And in Battle Royale, they've unvaulted several old weapons, including the grapple glove, the Boom Bow, the original pump shotgun, and the beloved Holo Twister rifle that was everybody's favorite gun during the first two seasons of Chapter 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859" data-ratio="0.51230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859"></a><figcaption>The Holo Twister assault rifle is back in Battle Royale this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg"></figure><p>And over in Fortnite OG, the path is diverging from how it went in Chapter 1 Season 5 the first time, with the giant purple cube Kevin from back in the day being replaced by the giant red cube Revin.</p><p>All these shenanigans are likely to come to an end at the same time double XP does on Monday, so there's only a limited amount of time to take part before things go back to normal.</p>

The developer discussed some of the movement changes coming to Call of Duty in Black Ops 7 as well as teased more remastered maps from 2012's Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of popular Call of Duty maps have been remastered over the years, and Black Ops 7 is already confirmed to have three at launch. Raid, Hijacked, and Express return this year, but they've all been remastered in previous Black Ops games, leaving fans eager for different maps to appear.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if players can get some Black Ops 2 remasters that have never been seen before, Treyarch design director Matt Scronce simply answered, "Yes, you can."</p><p dir="ltr">Maps like Yemen and Plaza have been highly requested over the years, so hopefully these locations will finally return to Call of Duty as remastered maps in Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce also discussed the movement for Black Ops 7 multiplayer. The developer re-confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 doesn't feature jet packs or wall-running mechanics. Instead, the game includes redefined omnimovement with a wall-jump ability, which can be chained together for up to three jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">"On that second and third jump, you're going to lose a little bit of momentum," Scronce explained. "We honestly want to make sure people aren't ping ponging around the maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision recently revealed that the previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7 has been cancelled</a>, mostly. Weapons, operator skins, and other cosmetics from Black Ops 6 will no longer transfer to Black Ops 7. Only double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to try out the game's multiplayer next month, as detailed in our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">how to get access to the Black Ops 7 beta</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

All the basics are recreated, of course, like the general layout of the office and the desks. The downstairs warehouse is there, too.</p><p>But this user-created space really shines with the finer points, like two chairs on the roof to signify where Jim and Pam watched fireworks together, along with the snowman-like sculptures in the parking lot where Jim was terrorized by Dwight.</p><p>It also includes a radar speed sign outside and multiple people standing around it, mirroring that time Michael ran a humanly impossible 31 mph. These smaller details aren't in the flyover video embedded below, but can be found in the creation itself and shared by the creator in comments posted on Reddit.</p><p>This is just the latest example of the immense creativity of No Man's Sky players, and you don't have to look hard to find more. Game creator Sean Murray highlighted some of his favorite No Man's Sky custom ship builds this week, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-players-are-going-wild-with-the-new-ship-builder/1100-6534464/" data-ref-id="1100-6534464">a ship modeled after Thomas the Tank engine and even himself.</a></p><p>As for The Office, the show's spin-off series The Paper is out now on Peacock. The show follows the same in-universe documentary crew that made The Office, but this time they're making a documentary about a struggling newspaper and the efforts to revitalize it. The show stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore, all episodes are out now, and a second season has already been ordered.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p dir="ltr">Roblox developers announced plans to introduce comprehensive age verification for all players who wish to communicate in-game. The verification will use "a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent."</p><p dir="ltr">Roblox detailed the upcoming changes in a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman, which it published on its website. In the statement, Kaufman claims the new methods will provide a more accurate age estimate than user input alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Once these system are in place, Roblox has promised to introduce more safety tools to prevent children from playing with adults who they don't know in real life. The announcement touts that Roblox has introduced over 100 safety tools to the platform since January 2025, including an open source AI system called "Roblox Sentinel" that's meant to detect early signs of child endangerment.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement does not outline a more specific timetable for these changes or address any privacy concerns players may have.</p><p dir="ltr">"We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow," the statement reads.</p><p dir="ltr">The change will make Roblox compliant with the UK's Online Safety Act, which passed in early August.</p><p dir="ltr">These changes come after Roblox has come under legislative scrutiny. After a 2024 report from <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Bloomberg</a> exposed a pedophile problem on the platform, Congressman Ro Khanna promoted a petition in August to demand that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/">Roblox do more to prevent child abuse</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In March, <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/">Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki</a> responded to the allegations, saying, "My first message would be, if you’re not comfortable, don’t let your kids be on Roblox," which prompted criticism from parents.</p>
