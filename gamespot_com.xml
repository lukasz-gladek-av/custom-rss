                <p>Epic Games is gearing up for its biggest shake-up to Fortnite Creative since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-announces-unreal-editor-for-fortnite-arriving-next-week/1100-6512398/" data-ref-id="1100-6512398">Unreal Editor for Fortnite</a>. Soon, Epic will allow developers who use UEFN to make Fortnite Creative modes, or "islands," to sell in-game items using V-Bucks, the game's real-money currency.</p><p dir="ltr">The news, which Epic announced during the Veteran's Day holiday in the US, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/1ouht3b/ive_got_a_feeling_this_could_ruin_fortnite/" rel="nofollow ">was not met with much excitement from fans</a>. The way the Fortnite Creative ecosystem is currently crammed with clones of tycoon, boxfight, and platforming islands, it's easy to see how adding microtransactions to any of the typical island types could be a bad thing. And it becomes much more difficult to see any possible upside when Epic's example idea is to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow ">sell people a better shovel for 300 V-Bucks</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will allow UEFN developers to sell gameplay items for money soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the reality is actually pretty murky, because V-Buck transactions are a wildcard that could completely shake up the Fortnite Creative ecosystem and encourage creators to try new things. We've got a digital Wild West here, in a sense. Let's try to understand the situation a little better, and get a better sense of where it may lead us, by taking a deep dive into the details.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What's actually happening with V-Bucks and Fortnite Creative</h2><p dir="ltr">Right now, creators can use UEFN to make islands that use the V-Buck mechanic, but they cannot publish these islands yet. The most important detail to understand here is that UEFN developers will not be able to sell any of the same types of things Epic sells--meaning purely cosmetic items are not allowed. That means no skins, no pickaxes, no kicks, and no original cosmetic types. Likewise, you can't sell XP gains, since Epic sells account levels in the shop. Random loot crates are allowed but will automatically be disabled in the many countries where that predatory practice is banned.</p><p dir="ltr">These restrictions mean, essentially, that anything sold in a Creative island must have a gameplay purpose. So in the current Creative ecosystem, the most obvious options are pay-to-win mechanics, like selling better-quality guns in a boxfight map, or some kind of bonus to your gains in a tycoon. Most of the available options are the kinds of things players generally dislike.</p><p dir="ltr">But since the current Creative ecosystem is currently geared entirely toward earning payouts from Epic through engagement and playtime, these V-Buck transactions probably aren't being added for the sake of most existing islands. Most current islands would drive people away if they started charging for things that used to be free, and those island creators will be able to keep earning those same playtime payouts in the same way they have been anyway. In other words, those maps can keep making money the same way they have been, so they may not want to bother with V-Buck shenanigans that could mess up their current streams of revenue.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, adding V-Buck transactions to Creative is at least partially about encouraging UEFN developers to try new things. And it's also about capitalizing on Steal the Brainrot, specifically.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot and your V-Bucks</h2><p dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot is the most popular Fortnite Creative island ever, with tens of thousands of players at any given moment and hundreds of thousands at peak times on the weekend. Steal the Brainrot is unique in that it's actually a licensed port of a popular Roblox game. It has no direct competition in Fortnite, because unlicensed copycat islands have faced legal action, and the Roblox version has a number of real-money transactions that are, thus far, absent from the Fortnite version.</p><p dir="ltr">Kids can use Robux to buy money, items, or Lucky Blocks that contain a random Brainrot--with the best Lucky Block going for $30. The mode also sells access to an "admin panel" that offers the ability to mess with your opponents for $50 or more, depending on the day's prices. We should expect these sort of predatory mobile-style, pay-to-win mechanics to be added to the Fortnite version once Epic allows creators to update their islands with the new microtransaction types.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not hard to figure, then, that Steal the Brainrot will be the first major beneficiary of these V-Buck transactions. But that doesn't mean you should expect to see that sort of thing everywhere in Fortnite.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Are Fortnite Creative and UEFN islands about to be filled with microtransactions?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Steal the Brainrot is a prime candidate for V-Buck transactions, that's not the case for most of the rest of the current Fortnite Creative ecosystem, which is largely built on folks ripping each other off. If one of 500 identical boxfight Pit maps tried selling better guns for V-Bucks, people would just switch to one that didn't do that. And it would be the same story with any of the other common Creative archetypes we currently have. You might see V-Buck donation boxes pop up, but you won't see many paywalls added to existing islands.</p><p dir="ltr">As it is now, there's a decent chance that Epic is adding V-Buck transactions to Fortnite Creative specifically to capitalize further on Steal the Brainrot, and there may not be much of an audience for them in the current ecosystem. But the ecosystem will change as a result of Epic offering this new way to monetize maps. You can expect a lot of creators to try the same old exploitative mobile game-style monetization tricks that we're all too familiar with by now, but there actually is some (hypothetical) good news in all this.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The possible upside to Fortnite Creative V-Buck transactions</h2><p dir="ltr">There certainly could be some decent outcomes from this. Right now, creators can only monetize based on their engagement stats, and that's led to a lot of trend-chasing as creators keep trying to make "better" versions of things that simply exist to waste your time rather than be particularly enjoyable. While plenty of predatory monetization could come with this, the upside is that it should encourage creators to try new types of games.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, this scheme would allow a developer to create an experience within a "paid area" and charge V-Bucks for permanent access--selling a video game within Fortnite, essentially. When devs have more ways to monetize, they're more likely to make more unique things.</p><p dir="ltr">But for now, all this is speculative. Aside from those Brainrots, we don't really know what kind of stuff will sell in this ecosystem. This is one of those situations where nobody, including Epic, really knows how it'll shake out, because it's going to be up to UEFN developers, and their players, to decide what works.</p>

You get to create a character, design a house, customize the furniture, and more as you interact with citizens and live out a cozy life in an open-world town. Not unlike The Sims, there's plenty to do: garden, fish, work, swim, raise children, discover personality traits, and more. Unfortunately, while it was planned to launch in early access on December 8, Massé <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118520/view/627816662678110824" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on the game's official Steam Store page</a> that Paralives' release has been delayed to May 25, 2026.</p>

<p>"We had to make the difficult decision to delay the release," Massé said. "We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode."</p><p>"However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town," Massé continued. "Which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community."</p><p>Massé <a href="https://paralives.notion.site/f138c4f6cb234604be16fe4198d17f51?v=41e2b3e389404b37b4060bc74dead4af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed to an updated roadmap</a> on the game's official website that focuses on the improvements the team will make over the coming months. Alongside addressing bugs and adding activities, these adjustments will include "fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience" to ensure that players are happy with the state the game launches in.</p><p>"We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game," Massé continued. "This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."</p><p>When Paralives launches in early access in May 2026, it'll get new features and add-on content that will be completely free of charge.</p>

                <p>If you're exploring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, Stella Montis, you may also be working on a quest called Cold Case. This quest asks you to head into Stella Montis to search for a J Kozma storage container to loot. This may sound like a tough thing to round up, but in reality, there's an extremely convenient way to get this quest knocked out and return to Speranza with minimal effort. Let's look into it.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to extract with an item you'll receive by looting a J Kozma storage container, so bring in a loadout with a safe pocket just in case someone comes along and tries to ruin your run. As you'll see below, we'll be looting a container directly beside an extraction point, which reduces the chances that you'll encounter any trouble. But it's always better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>When you're ready to finish Cold Case, check below for where to find a J Kozma storage container.</p><h2>Where to find a J Kozma storage container for the Cold Case quest</h2><p>The J Kozma storage container can only be found on the Stella Montis map. While J Kozma storage containers can be found in various locations around the map, the easiest and most efficient to grab will likely be the one inside the Lobby Metro Station. This is because it's directly beside the button you'll need to hit to call in the train for extraction. You really can't get any more convenient.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586" data-ratio="0.56325910931174" data-width="1976" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586"></a><figcaption>Head to the Lobby Metro Station to find the J Kozma storage container.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Head down inside this POI to the extraction point. If you want to get out easily to finish the quest, go ahead and press the button to call the train, then turn 180 degrees to spot a container in front of the button. Walk forward and interact with the container to cause the Old World Books item to fall out. <strong>Make sure you pick up the Old World Books and add them to your inventory</strong>--preferably in a safe pocket just in case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587"></a><figcaption>Interact with the J Kozma storage container, then loot the Old World Books.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the Old World Books obtained for Shani, you'll need to extract back to Speranza to complete the quest. Get in some cover until the train arrives and play it safe, as you never know when another raider could be in the area looking to score some easy loot from folks extracting. Once the train arrives, make a dash for the console inside and get back to Speranza. Easy peasy!</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

The game includes a full co-op campaign and mission collectibles to hunt down. Below, we'll break down the mission list and give you all the details you need before jumping into the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Black Ops 7 - Campaign length and missions</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has a total of 11 campaign missions. This is designed as a co-op campaign for up to four players, but it can be experienced solo, as well. This cooperative design has removed Call of Duty's feature of allowing you to choose the difficulty you play the campaign. Instead, difficulty scales based on how many players are in your party. However, playing solo isn't necessarily the easier route, and it might take a bit longer to complete alone.</p>

                <p>Once you've gone on enough raids and worked your way through some quests, you can eventually gain access to Stella Montis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map. While you're exploring this new map, you'll want to make sure you're working on Lance's quest In My Image, which tasks you with finding and looting three androids in Stella Montis. And about that--we have some good news and bad news we'll dive into further down.</p><p>Before heading in, be aware that you don't need to extract from Stella Montis to complete In My Image, so you can always bring in a free loadout if you just want to navigate this labyrinthine map in search of androids. By doing so, you'll eliminate any major loss of resources if you find yourself in a bad situation and don't get out.</p><p>When you're ready to set off, here's how to complete In My Image.</p><h2>Where to find androids for the In My Image quest</h2><p>Though Androids can be found on other maps, you'll need to specifically find Androids on the Stella Montis map to complete this quest. They look like the same androids that you may have encountered on the lower levels of Blue Gate, but only the ones in Stella Montis can actually be looted. Well, some of them, anyway. Remember when we said we had some good news and bad news?</p><p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no specific spot on the map dedicated to finding androids</strong>, meaning you'll just need to explore the map thoroughly to come across random locations where these inactive robotic humanoids are leaned against walls or splayed out on the floor. Additionally, not every android you come across in Stella Montis can be looted. Some are static and can't be interacted with at all, which means you'll need to keep an eye out specifically for those that have a little icon show up over their bodies indicating that you can loot them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569"></a><figcaption>Loot three androids to complete In My Image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>But there's some good news, too. Androids aren't that rare in Stella Montis. You may need to walk around for a while checking rooms and hallways, but with enough time (and a sharp eye), you'll almost certainly come across enough of them to complete the quest within a run or two. Make sure you're checking corners and other areas that aren't in your direct line of sight, as the androids can sometimes be sitting in spots you wouldn't expect.</p><p>Once you've found and looted three androids, you will complete In My Image and be ready to return to Lance in Speranza. Head to one of the Stella Montis extraction points while being careful to avoid other raiders and the Shredder enemies roaming the area, then make your way back to continue to the next quest.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Valve Talks The Next Steam Deck | GameSpot News</p>
      </div>
<p>"Obviously, the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck," Griffais explained. "The thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product."</p><p>In Griffais' summation, Valve doesn't just want a better battery in the Steam Deck 2--though that would be a welcome improvement, considering it was a point of contention in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">GameSpot's Steam Deck review</a>. Instead, the company wants something more substantial, an upgrade that makes the new handheld worthy of being a Steam Deck successor. To get there, the available Systems on a Chip (SoC) need to catch up to Valve's ambitions.</p><p>"We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life," Griffais continued. "We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."</p><p>This lines up with what Griffais has previously said regarding Valve building a Steam Deck 2. Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge in September 2023</a>, Griffais explained that the company is waiting for a "significant enough increase" in performance technology, suggesting an upgraded Steam Deck may not arrive until 2026. </p><p>"We also don't want more performance to come at a significant cost to power efficiency and battery life," Griffais said at the time. "I don’t anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but we’re still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there."</p><p>Released in February 2022, the company launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-release-better-screen-battery-life/1100-6519051/" data-ref-id="1100-6519051">a revised Steam Deck in November 2023</a> that retained the same performance as the original model but included an OLED display. This Steam Deck 2 sounds like it'll be a much more powerful device, so long as the technology Valve hopes for comes to fruition.</p><p>While a Steam Deck 2 may be a little ways away, the company's imminent hardware lineup is coming out soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine</a> are all shipping in early 2026, and while we don't know the prices just yet, hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">affordability is a key concern</a> for Valve.</p>
