                <p>Project Polaris, the codename for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">next Witcher game</a>, has crossed a major milestone: It's now officially in full production. CD Projekt made the announcement today, November 26, as part of the company's wider earnings briefing.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba said the game--unofficially know as The Witcher 4--has "entered the full-scale production phase," following a period of pre-production. "With new challenges just around the corner, it's the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!," he said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase!

No stopping… <a href="https://t.co/2pJdsg2sWX" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/2pJdsg2sWX</a></p>  — Sebastian Kalemba (@Skalemba) <a href="https://twitter.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The majority of CD Projekt's development staff, totaling 400 of 650 total staffers, are now working on Polaris. This is actually down from 410 people as of July 31, 2024, before the game entered full production.</p><p>CD Projekt has a number of other games in the works, too, including Orion (the next Cyberpunk game), which has 64 people working on it now. Then there's Sirius (a Witcher spin-off) that has 32 people working on it. A total of 15 people are working on Hadar (a new IP), while other staff are contributing to "shared services" and other projects. You can see a headcount breakdown in the graphic below.</p><p>Not much is known about The Witcher 4, or whatever the game might be called. Management previously indicated, back in 2022, that The Witcher 4 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/" data-ref-id="1100-6508062">released in 2025 at the very soonest</a>, but this plan could have changed since then.</p><p>As for the story, we know Geralt will be in the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">he won't be the focus of the narrative.</a> Joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski previously said The Witcher 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">not going to be "The Witcher 3 in new clothing."</a> It aims to break new ground and stand apart from the games that came before it.</p><p>Also during the earnings report, CD Projekt announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold 30 million copies, with its Phantom Liberty expansion shifting 8 million copies.</p>

Niantic is hoping to monetize this data, but even at this early stage, the company realizes that this could be put to use in unintended ways, including during war time.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-data-adding-amplitude-to-war-is-obviously-an-issue-niantic-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic Senior Vice President of Engineering Brian McClendon was asked about a military application of the company's Large Geospatial Model during the Bellingcat’s Bellingfest event.</p><p>"I could definitely see it," said McClendon. "I think the question is would there be anything that they would do with it that would be outside of what a consumer or a Bellingcat want to do with it. If the use case is identical, then that seems completely fine. If the use case is specific in military and adding amplitude to war then that's obviously an issue."</p><p>Take, for example, the ongoing war in Ukraine. If Russia had access to complete 3D models of Ukraine's cities and countryside, it would give the invading country a tactical advantage that it doesn't currently have. For now, Niantic hasn't ruled out selling its LGM data to governments in the future.</p><p>"The LGM is an early stage project and is months or even years away from any kind of product," noted a Niantic spokesperson when asked about the possibility of selling the data. "Just like any kind of AI, there will be important questions that arise and we'll tackle those responsibly and thoughtfully."</p><p>For now, we don't have to worry about Pikachu and the other Pokemon being used to map out current combat zones in the near future. Niantic's early map of the LGM model appears to be largely composed of locations in North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is a long way from being completed.</p><p>One of the franchise's other mobile games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, recently attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-pushes-past-30-million-downloads-tops-app-store-chart/1100-6527660/" data-ref-id="1100-6527660">30 million downloads</a> in its first week alone.

                <p>Activision has responded to concerns about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Ranked playlist, and specifically the efforts being undertaken to try to thwart cheaters. The company says it's banned thousands of players and is banning more people every hour, but some popular streamers have spoken out to voice their ongoing concerns.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1861241515798098184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Activision said the AI-powered systems in Call of Duty's anti-cheat technology, Ricochet, "continue to ramp up with code optimizations" that aim to "accelerate enforcements" against bad actors. Since Ranked play launched last week, Activision has banned more than 19,000 people, and Ricochet is doing "hourly sweeps" to kick more cheaters out.</p><p>Activision has always said the fight against cheaters is an ongoing battle, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">one that may never be solved completely</a>. Popular streamer Nadeshot <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1861245061368787123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the statement</a>, saying it's "complete propaganda" from his vantage point.</p><p>"Ten names minimum in the first three pages we're legitimately spin-botting LIVE on our streams. How could there possibly be 19K accounts banned when the most egregious abusers are giving us the middle finger on the leaderboard? Are we crazy? What is going on," he said.</p><p>Another popular streamer, Westie, <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1861345175219425620" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said </a>Activision's Ricochet updates are ineffective and that they "result in absolutely zero change to the gameplay experience." He also said cheating remains a problem in Warzone. "It feels like the anti-cheat has been turned off," he said.</p><p>Another issue that Call of Duty fans have surfaced is that the Ranked mode on console forces players to use cross-play, which puts them into matches with PC players. A mouse-and-keyboard setup is understood to be the most precise way to play a FPS like Call of Duty, and many have voiced concerns about a "level playing field" when people on console, using a controller, are forced to play against people using mouse and keyboard. Then there is the issue of cheating, as it's generally easier to install cheat software on PC compared to console.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-patch-notes-reveal-movement-change-and-warzone-player-count-adjustments/1100-6528043/" data-ref-id="1100-6528043">reduced the player cap for Warzone's new map, Area 99.</a> Activision also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-had-biggest-launch-period-player-total-in-series-history/1100-6528034/" data-ref-id="1100-6528034">Black Ops 6 had the biggest launch in franchise history, thanks in part to Game Pass.</a></p>

In comparison to the seamless design of the Magic Mouse, these Logitech Mac mice offer a traditional design with clearly defined buttons and different colors. It's worth noting that you'll need to purchase a Logi Bolt dongle to get them to work on a Mac via Bluetooth, but these are very affordable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-956-000007-LOGITECH-Bolt-Receiver/dp/B09JL9Y1WS?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and you can get one for around $13</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Logitech MX Anywhere 3S is on sale for $61 for its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFJ1YSX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black version</a> and $68 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFHSH35?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey model</a>--a nice discount from the usual $80 MSRP. This is a lightweight mouse optimized for Apple MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and iPad tablets, and it features an accurate sensor, USB-C quick-charging, an 8K DPI sensor, and a very precise scrolling wheel. Logitech also offers a version for Windows PCs, so if you like its compact design, you'll be covered if you want to use it on a PC running Microsoft's operating system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">MX Anywhere 3S (Mac)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405695"></a><figcaption>MX Anywhere 3S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405695-logitech-mx-1.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFJ1YSX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $61 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Anywhere-Wireless-Bluetooth-Any-Surface/dp/B0CVFHSH35?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey</a> -- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">MX Anywhere 3S (Windows)</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black </a>-- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY1JM2Q?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pale Grey</a> -- $65 ($<del>80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY51TZ3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rose</a> -- $68 ($<del>80</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech MX Master 3S</a> offers a high-performance option for MacOS and iPadOS users, as this mouse is equipped with easy-to-reach thumb controls.
