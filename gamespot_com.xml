                <p>Playing defense is one of the most crucial elements to success in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. While you might want to sim through all of the defensive series in a game or just use the coach's suggestion plays to get through a drive, you can really turn the tide of a game if you actually concentrate on defense.</p><p>If you want to make that job easier on yourself, it's imperative to use the right defensive playbook in College Football 26. A majority of the game modes allow you to select any team's playbook on offense and defense, giving you freedom to choose what kind of plays you have access to.</p><p>Of course, defensive plays are a little trickier to understand than offensive ones. So, to make matters simpler, you can take a look below at our picks for the best defensive formations and playbooks available in CFB 26. If you make your own custom playbook and combine these formations We've already covered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">best offensive playbooks</a> if you want to check out that side of the ball.</p><h2>Best defensive schemes in College Football 26</h2><p>When it comes to selecting a defensive playbook, you have to consider a few different factors. You need to determine if you want to run a specific kind of defense and what that defense is. Of course, you can also select a solid all-around playbook that features plays from various formations, giving you access to a wide selection of plays.</p><p>Fortunately, we've got you covered regardless of your preferences. Below, you can see our pick for the best schemes, collectively making up the best defensive playbook in the game.</p><h3>3-4 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg"></figure><p>Let's start off with a classic. The modern 3-4 Defense was popularized by now North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick during his 40+ years in the NFL. In CFB 26, it's arguably the best standard defense that covers all of your bases when it comes to countering what play an offense will run.</p><p>In 3-4, you'll have three defensive linemen and four linebackers on the field. 3-4 relies on some stability from the interior of the defense, which means your defensive tackles and inside linebackers need to ensure they're covering the middle of the field. However, you also don't want to leave any passing lanes exposed, which is where your other linebackers come into play. For 3-4, you generally want to user the middle linebacker to cover passing lanes or possibly the defensive tackle to try and get pressure on the opposing quarterback.</p><h3>3-3-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg"></figure><p>Next up, we have an alternate defensive playbook, which uses the 3-3-5 defense. This defensive formation utilizes three down defensive linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. Naturally, with one less lineman/linebacker, you're going to have to get creative when it comes to pressuring the quarterback.</p><p>Fortunately, the 3-3-5 defense utilizes plenty of safety and cornerback pressures to compensate for the missing pass rusher. You can also use your six linemen and linebackers to shoot different gaps on passing and rushing plays. 3-3-5 defense can come with some risk if you don't guess the right play or make the correct pre-snap adjustments, but it can also be a truly difficult defense to play against if you can cover all your bases.</p><h3>3-2-6 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg"></figure><p>The 3-2-6 defense is one you want to use if you're overly worried about defending against the pass in CFB 26. Utilizing six defensive backs and only two traditional linebackers, you'll have a difficult time getting any consistent pressure on the quarterback with this defense. However, that abundance of DBs makes it incredibly difficult for the quarterback to find any open receiver.</p><p>Moreover, the defense often makes use of speedier linebackers that drop into coverage as well, meaning you might only have three defensive linemen trying to stop the run and get to the quarterback. As long as you can predict when a pass is coming and use the right plays accordingly, the 3-2-6 defense will be a thorn in the side of any opponent that wishes to pass to ball.</p><h3>4-2-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, we have the 4-2-5 defense, which is a mix between the 3-2-6 and 3-3-5 defenses. Compared to the 3-2-6 defense, which is all about defending against the pass, the 4-2-5 focuses more on defending the run and getting to the quarterback. While you do still have five defensive backs in the mix, one of them is often responsible for applying pressure from the outside. This, mixed with four down defensive linemen and a linebacker or two, makes getting to the quarterback much easier.</p><p>Of course, what makes the 4-2-5 great is that you also have some flexibility to defend against the pass. You can use all five DBs to drop into coverage along with your two linebackers. On plays where the offense takes some time to develop, you can cover all receivers and possibly get to the quarterback with your four linemen. Quick passing plays might beat the 4-2-5, though, so watch out for those.</p>

                <p>As one of the biggest games in the world, Fortnite has long had its fair share of bad actors targeting it and its players. Epic Games has responded over the years by beefing up its safety and security capacities and investing in protective measures to ensure the stability of the game.</p><p>Recently, Epic took legal action against two individuals, a cheat seller and the perpetrator of a string of DDoS attacks against Fortnite creators. According to Epic's comments on the matter, the DDoSer had been disrupting livestreams of Fortnite content, in addition to conducting "stream sniping" campaigns. The other person, meanwhile, had been selling and using permanent Fortnite bans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1944788275711054250" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We took legal action against two people who cheated and broke our rules:<br>One sold and used cheats and the other carried out cyber attacks on content creators who were livestreaming gameplay (aka: DDoS attacks).

Their social media accounts have also been scrubbed of content.</p><p>In their apology video, the DDoSer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD-KyTph9DI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zebsi</a>, shared that they carried out the cyberattacks under a particular username. They also apologized for the "damage" the attacks did to Epic, the community, and the targeted streamers. The cheat seller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqijCVqMGM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirrored</a>, admitted to using, selling, and distributing "cheats and hardware," and they said that they had cheated in Fortnite tournaments. They also shared that they were permanently banned from the game and would face additional legal action if they cheated again.</p><p>Epic has taken a hard line against cheating in abuse in recent times, and this move to force public apologies from two individuals is a clear example of the company's efforts to increase deterrence. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">Epic won a judgment against a different cheater</a>, resulting in the levying of a $175,000 fine that the company donated to charity.</p>

                <p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> got some serious competition in the realm of hero shooters when NetEase launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. A number of new Overwatch 2 features have also drawn comparisons to Marvel Rivals, including the recent reveal of the third-person <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Stadium mode</a>. But according to Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, Stadium mode and other features weren't made in response to Marvel Rivals. Instead, many of them were planned before Marvel Rivals debuted.</p><p>"I think that competition is healthy," said Keller during a guest appearance on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2508946186" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay3's stream</a>. "It does force people to innovate more and to always be putting your best foot forward, but I don't think what you're seeing in Overwatch 2 right now is a response to Marvel Rivals. So much of what we were doing this year--from perks to Stadium to map voting, we did full hero bans--so much of what we're doing here and all the heroes we're releasing has been in the works for over a year as part of a new strategy for the game to have a big annual kick off to the year."</p><p>Keller suggested that there may things added to Overwatch 2 in the future if the games are still actively competing, but he didn't add any specifics beyond that. During the same stream, Keller acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-director-acknowledges-that-game-needs-more-story-content-to-be-firing-on-all-cylinders/1100-6533118/" data-ref-id="1100-6533118">Overwatch 2 has had very little of the story content, cinematics, and animated shorts</a> that helped define the world in the first game. However, he expressed a desire to place more emphasis on story in the future.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-g-i-joe-costumes-in-july/1100-6532738/" data-ref-id="1100-6532738">Overwatch 2 x G.I.

                <p>The next Nintendo Direct might be coming up very soon. That's according to reputable source Nate the Hate, who said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> today, July 14, that the next Direct is slated for this month.</p><p>"It is the million dollar question. I have been told there is a Direct this month, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases," he said. "Beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point."</p><p>Bananza launches on July 17 for Switch 2, so a possible Direct would happen after that if this report proves to be accurate.</p><p>That's all he had to say about a possible upcoming Direct. Nintendo could have any number of things to announce at a Direct, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">potential Donkey Kong movie</a> or confirmation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>. Activision is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">keen to bring Call of Duty to Switch.</a></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents event slated for July 22</a>. Nate the Hate pointed out that this Nintendo-adjacent event <em>and </em>a Nintendo Direct in the same week is not unprecedented, but he feels safer speculating that the July Direct could happen during the last week of the month instead. If that's true, it would happen just before Nintendo releases its latest earnings results on August 1.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on June 18 and was exclusively dedicated to Bananza. Before that, there was the big Switch 2 Direct on April 2 and then a Mario Kart World Direct on April 17. Nintendo did not hold a Nintendo Direct event in July 2024 or July 2023, but that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-X7hRDf7qr3vJ94YQpTr-eGgfDvyx6gP0lkrBREZtbPWVlMDV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a> might not mean anything.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How The Fallout TV Show Shapes Fallout's Future</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Corden said from what he has heard, part of the forward push for Fallout 5 and Fallout in general came at the expense of ZeniMax Online's next MMO, codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceled as part of Microsoft's latest round of layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As Corden explains, MMOs are expensive to build and have to compete with established games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and even ZeniMax's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. With that in mind, Microsoft made the decision to cancel ZeniMax's unannounced project and invest that money into Fallout, an established IP that would more likely be a "surefire win."</p><p dir="ltr">"From what I heard, it was a case of 'Do we want to sink a ton of money into getting this [project Blackbird] to a point where it can compete with the established players in the market, or do we want to allocate that investment towards making Fallout 5?'" Corden said.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that Corden states that he doesn't have enough information to write a full story about Fallout 5 or who may be developing it, so it's worth taking the information above with a grain of salt.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Blackbird was still in pre-production when it was canceled, but no official details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-revealed-about-elder-scrolls-online-devs-rumored-canceled-game/1100-6532943/" data-ref-id="1100-6532943">next game from the Elder Scrolls Online dev</a> had been announced. It had reportedly been in development since 2018, ran on a new engine, and was to be a new sci-fi IP. Development on the game was said to have been going well and had begun ramping up, with higher-ups at Xbox seemingly approving of the game just a few months prior to cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of who is developing Fallout 5, the fact that it is just now greenlit means it will likely be many years before it releases. However, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly in the works</a> that could arrive sooner. Renewed interest in Fallout reached new heights with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a> in 2024, with star Walton Goggins recently offering an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-update-from-walton-goggins/1100-6529385/" data-ref-id="1100-6529385">update on Fallout Season 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the next Elder Scrolls game is currently being worked on, with Bethesda Game Studios head Todd Howard recently reassuring fans that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/" data-ref-id="1100-6531019">"obviously" working on Elders Scrolls 6</a> even amidst the release of Oblivion Remastered.</p>

This updated version of the classic real-time-strategy game first released by Relic in 2004 will make the game far more playable on modern hardware and will include widescreen and 4K resolution support, upscaled textures four times that of their original resolution, an improved camera, HUD optimizations, and upgrades to lighting, unit reflections, and shadows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY_JzB0WxSA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to "support the ongoing efforts of the modding community" and will be fully compatible with existing mods, according to a press release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War – Definitive Edition</a> will be $30 and additionally include each of the game's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. Each expansion added new playable armies, multiplayer maps, and additional campaigns (in the case of Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, non-linear campaigns playable with different armies). Some of the armies added in Dawn of War's expansions include fan-favorites like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The definitive edition of Dawn of War will essentially replace a previous anniversary edition released in 2006 that bundled together all of the game's content. Those "loyal fans" who own the anniversary edition will receive a 30% discount on buying the definitive edition, with the discount remaining active "for the foreseeable future," according to Relic. That puts Dawn of War – Definitive Edition's price at $21 for anniversary edition owners.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate the release date announcement, Relic dropped a 4K enhanced version of the original Dawn of War's iconic CGI trailer, one that shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens engaged in a desperate battle against an Orkish horde.</p><p dir="ltr">While fans seem to appreciate the updated trailer overall, one change--the removal of a Space Marine sergeant's scream and its replacement with voiceover from a well-established character not depicted in the trailer--has ruffled the feathers of some. Relic in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> said the Space Marine's original "roar was even more beloved than we realized," and that "we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K video game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/" data-ref-id="1100-6532761">Space Marine 2 recently received its long-awaited Siege mode</a> update, while the remastered re-release of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-pc-remaster-had-so-many-launch-issues-sega-is-offering-refunds/1100-6532885/" data-ref-id="1100-6532885">Space Marine has been mired in so many issues</a> publisher Sega has begun offering refunds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Black Ops 7 was first announced in June during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Activision didn't do much in the way of hyping or teasing the reveal beforehand, and that was intentional, as the company was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-will-be-like-a-beyonce-album-release-activision-says/1100-6532275/" data-ref-id="1100-6532275">actively trying to copy Beyonce's approach.</a></p><p>The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years. Treyarch and Raven Software are the main co-developers for Black Ops 7, and these two studios also co-developed 2024's Black Ops 6.</p><p>In addition to Black Ops 7, it's expected that Call of Duty: Warzone will get new updates in the future tied to Black Ops 7. In fact, the Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 stars Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason. The celebrity cast also includes Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, with Guardians of the Galaxy's Michael Rooker reprising his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. There was no announcement about a version of the game for the Switch 2, but Activision and Microsoft have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">remain committed to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo systems.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix is prepping a remake of Dragon Quest VII, according to a new report. The RPG originally launched on PlayStation in 2000 in Japan and 2001 in the US, with this new take supposedly set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the Dragon Quest VII project is labeled as a "remake" instead of an "HD remake," like the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-history-repeats/1900-6418319/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> that arrived last year. So the RPG could be receiving much more than just a fresh coat of paint, such as gameplay alterations. Before then, however, Square Enix has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a> set to launch on October 30.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - 7 Minutes Of Playstation 5 Gameplay | Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka stated earlier this year that he would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-dev-wants-to-do-final-fantasy-6-next/1100-6527894/">love to tackle Final Fantasy VI next</a>. Hayasake made it clear this was just his personal preference while also noting that the beloved RPG was a major reference point for Octopath Traveler, the first HD-2D game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wouldn't be the first time Square Enix has updated Dragon Quest VII, either. In the mid-2010s, the company released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-fragments-of-the-forgotten-past-rev/1100-6443512/">Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past</a> on Nintendo 3DS. The revamped version of the RPG sported a new visual presentation as well as visible enemies on the map.</p><p>Square Enix is busy remaking another major RPG franchise's seventh entry, too. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/">The story scenario for the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake was just completed</a> at the beginning of 2025. In May, the company confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/">the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy would come to Switch 2</a>. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (the second part) launched in 2024, and there's no release date yet for the final installment.</p>
