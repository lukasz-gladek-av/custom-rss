The update also quietly removes one of Call of Duty's most annoying weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">The riot shield is a loadout weapon that's received a lot of hate over the years, as the bullet-deflecting shield is a frustrating weapon to counter in both multiplayer and Warzone. However, players have quickly noticed that the riot shield is gone in Warzone.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857085864074969582" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">As of now, the Riot Shield is gone from Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857085864074969582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's weapon pool doesn't include a riot shield, but all of the weapons from Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 were part of Call of Duty's Carry Forward plan for the game's integration into Warzone. When customizing a loadout, players can cycle through all of the guns and melee weapons for all three games, but the Modern Warfare 2 riot shield seems to be the only item missing.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-anti-cheat-and-weapon-changes/2900-5947/" data-ref-id="2900-5947">The Season 1 patch notes</a> don't address the removal of the riot shield, so it's uncertain if this was an intentional decision, or if the riot shield was accidentally left out with Black Ops 6's integration.</p><p dir="ltr">The riot shield has been a part of Warzone since launch, so while there are probably plenty of players rejoicing the shield's disappearance, there will likely be some fans missing out on their riot-shield strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 of Warzone also adds the brand-new Area 99 Resurgence map, and for the first time ever, the game now has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-mastery-camos-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527349/" data-ref-id="1100-6527349">unique Mastery camo grind</a>.

Zombies won't receive a new map until Season 1 Reloaded, but the new update does add the ability to purchase Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 returns the Gobblegum system from the Zombies mode in Black Ops 3, and it includes special gumballs that offer a range of temporary or one-time use abilities to help in the fight against zombie hordes. Some Gobblegums can help players upgrade their weapon rarity, give them free perks, revive teammates, or even teleport them away from danger.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399719"></a><figcaption>Season 1 Gobblegum packs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4399719-gobblegumsinstore.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 update to Black Ops 6 brings plenty of new cosmetic bundles to the in-game shop, and this includes Gobblegum packs for Zombies players. As of right now, the shop contains a small assortment of packs ranging from 200 CoD Points ($2) for a pack of three gums to a large pack of 12 high-end Gobblegums for 1,100 CoD Points ($10).</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's definitely worth noting that the Gobblegums are an optional loadout item, and Black Ops 6 makes it easier than past years to earn free Gobblegums. Players earn the gums randomly while playing Zombies, and there are even double-XP events that can sometimes increase the Gobblegum earn rate.</p><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums are featured in the Season 1 battle pass, and they'll likely be available as rewards in future events as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 1 battle pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-battle-pass-includes-dlc-weapons-sev-operator-and-new-blackcell/2900-5944/">features over 100 items to unlock</a>, including two new weapons, Sev as a playable operator, and plenty of cosmetic weapon blueprints.

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has reportedly stated that he's been working on his next game since 2020. According to reports, Druckmann revealed this during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion this week in which he appeared alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine.</p><p>A video of the event has been set to private, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">people on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) claim Druckmann stated that he's been working on this new game, whatever it might be, since 2020.</p><p>This would be little surprise, as Naughty Dog's last big brand-new game, The Last of Us: Part II, was released in 2020. It makes sense that Druckmann would begin working on his next project around then. As for what the game might be, that's anyone's guess, but there have been clues.</p><p>Following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, Naughty Dog confirmed that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">working on two single-player games.</a> One of these is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">expected to be The Last of Us: Part III</a> and the other is a mystery. In May this year, Druckmann said the new game he's working on is very exciting to him, and that's he feels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-teases-next-game-and-shares-his-belief-in-ai/1100-6523665/" data-ref-id="1100-6523665">"maybe the most excited" in his life</a> about whatever the game is. "I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said.</p><p>In addition to a potential new The Last of Us game, HBO is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-tees-off-in-spring-2025/1100-6527733/" data-ref-id="1100-6527733">bringing back The Last of Us TV series with its sophomore season in Spring 2025.</a> Druckmann is involved in the production of the show, in addition to his responsibilities in video game development.</p><p>Some are hoping that Naughty Dog might bring back the Uncharted series, but no one should get their hopes up about that. Naughty Dog has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-is-done-with-uncharted-and-might-not-make-last-of-us-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6510879/" data-ref-id="1100-6510879">"done" with the franchise</a> (though a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">different team could, of course, make its own Uncharted game</a>).</p>
