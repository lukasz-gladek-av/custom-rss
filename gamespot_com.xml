                <p>Artificial intelligence remains one of the biggest talking points in video games and many other industries, and now Nintendo of America's president has weighed in to share his thoughts.</p><p>Doug Bowser told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/nintendo-president-on-the-new-switch-2-tariffs-and-whats-next.html?jwsource=cl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> that he sees opportunities for AI technologies to enhance productivity in some areas, but when it comes to actual game development, humans will always lead the way.</p><p>"If developers choose to use AI--and it is a discussion right now at Nintendo--it's not the only method of developing games," he said. "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers. Their artistic capabilities. Their insight into how people play. So there is always, always going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>He added that AI is no different than any other new technology that's come onto the market, saying Nintendo might choose to leverage it if it helps to create "a better gameplay experience."</p><p>It appears Nintendo's executives are aligned in their messaging on this subject, as Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Looking outside Nintendo, Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a>.</p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> launches in June. The price point was announced at $450, but some believe Nintendo will end up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">raising prices due to newly announced tariffs. </a></p>

The console is still slated to release on June 5, and we’ll likely hear more about the preorder situation and any possible pricing adjustments in the coming weeks.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-console-bundle-deals-still-available-at-amazon/1100-6529417/">Astro Bot PS5 Console Bundle Deals Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-steelbook-and-exclusive-crafting-table-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6530625/">Minecraft Movie Steelbook And Exclusive Crafting Table Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-here-are-your-options/1100-6530578/">MicroSD Express Cards For Nintendo Switch 2 - Here Are Your Options</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-building-sets-get-nice-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Lego Mario Kart Building Sets Get Nice Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Grammy-winning artist Sabrina Carpenter is on her way to Fortnite with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">skins, music packs, and more</a>. Officially announced in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Fortnite website, the artist will headline Fortnite Festival Season 8 as this season's Icon, beginning on April 8.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Festival is sort of like a Rock Band-like game mode that lives within Fortnite and lets up to four players perform together online. Carpenter is the latest of Festival Icons joining Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Metallica</a>.</p><p>"I've always found it exciting for fans to be able to interact and engage with music through different art forms and to interact in a way that’s genuinely fun," Carpenter told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/sabrina-carpenter-fortnite-headliner-1235311131/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> in a statement. "So, for the fans that haven't been able to come to the tour, or to any new fans, this is such a special way to still be a part of Short n' Sweet world."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959"></a><figcaption>Give your game a shot of Espresso with these looks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>By unlocking the Season Eight Music Pass, players can access a ton of new Carpenter-inspired content, including new Jam Tracks "Juno" and "Nonsense," which are fully playable as performances with others in Festival. Of course, the biggest selling point is the ability to play as Sabrina herself, who comes with two skins (each with two color variations) based on outfits from her recent Short n’ Sweet tour.</p><p>To purchase the music pass, Fortnite players need 1,400 V-Bucks (roughly $13). After that, players will immediately unlock the yellow babydoll Sabrina Carpenter Outfit--with an included Lego Style. The outfit resembles the one she wore on her most recent tour. At the end of the pass, players will receive a similar bodysuit, another look from her tour.</p><p>One of the bigger changes coming this season will be the renaming of Fortnite emotes; all of those that include dancing will now be aptly called dance emotes in the Locker. While using a dance emote, any player can do the same dance with you--even if they don't own the emote. There will be two Sabrina-inspired dance emotes this season: the Taste Emote and the Please Please Please Emote, which are each choreographed to the song they're tied to.</p><p>As the season progresses, players can unlock more Sabrina goodies like a skirt and boots inspired by another tour look. This has a pink default Style, a Baby Blue alt Style, and another Lego version. There will also be a matching lipstick-stained purse with both pink and blue stylings. Lastly, customizations like her own Battle Bus contrail and microphone.</p><p>Since launching in late 2023, Fortnite Festival has been bringing in a new headlining artist every three months or so. The current season is headlined by virtual pop star <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku</a>. </p>

                <p>Bungie is set to finally reveal what playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, an extraction-shooter revival of Bungie's sci-fi FPS series, will be like. A gameplay reveal showcase is slated for April 12 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon's social media accounts sparked to life in the past week, pointing to an ARG (alternate reality game) that led to online sleuthing for puzzle solutions and secrets, in the process unveiling new artwork for the game and presumably helping to unlock Bungie's official announcement of the gameplay showcase.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie's next game was announced two years ago with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533">stylish trailer</a> but few details other than it would be an extraction shooter set in the same universe of Bungie's old, pre-Halo IP that ended with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon-infinity/" data-ref-id="5000-5911">Marathon Infinity</a> in 1996. Marathon is Bungie's first new game since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> in 2017, though Destiny has received regular updates and expansions since then.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans still don't have many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">official details of what playing Marathon will entail</a> aside from the usual extraction genre staples of competing against other teams to make it out alive with a bag of precious loot (though a brief teaser clip for the gameplay reveal does include a pink robotic cat). Bungie provided a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-gets-its-first-update-in-over-a-year-albeit-with-few-new-details/1100-6527427/" data-ref-id="1100-6527427">detail-light update in October 2024 that hinted Marathon would be bringing a hero shooter</a> approach to the genre, implying some of what some "Runners" (Marathon's name for player characters) would be able to do. A report from around the same time indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">Marathon would be $40</a> and not free-to-play, but it's unclear if that is still Bungie's plan or if plans have changed.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-as-employees-fear-more-layoffs-report/1100-6521967/" data-ref-id="1100-6521967">new game director, Joe Ziegler,</a> in late 2023 following layoffs at Bungie. He previously worked at Riot on its popular free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a>. The game's old director, Chris Barrett, was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-marathon-director-chris-barrett-sues-sony-and-bungie-after-unfounded-firing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly let go from Bungie</a> for alleged misconduct towards women coworkers, and is now suing Bungie and parent company Sony alleging he was fired without cause. Another round of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">layoffs at Bungie, which affected 220 people</a>, happened in July 2024 following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but does not have an official release date or window just yet. No doubt more information will be revealed at the Marathon gameplay showcase, so fans won't have to wait long for more news.</p>
