                <p>The Animaniacs was the follow-up series to Tiny Toon Adventures and introduced young audiences to the Warner Bros. characters Wakko, Yakko, and their sister, Dot. The animated program was a huge hit, spawning merchandise, a movie, and nine video games--including the two spin-off games focused on Pinky and The Brain. Recently, however, a never-released tenth game has been unearthed, and it would have been released on Game Boy Advance.</p><p>The preservationist group <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hidden Palace</a> released information about the game, Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics, and even uploaded it so players can now play the long-lost game. You can watch some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6EQ4aeWY9M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Hello again! Presenting: A nearly complete build of Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics for the Game Boy Advance, a game that was thought to have been lost until now! <a href="https://t.co/5x4gHghzWU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/5x4gHghzWU</a></p>  — The Hidden Palace (@HiddenPalaceOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Like similar games from the franchise, the game sees players take control of the Warner siblings, facing off against the genetically enhanced lab mice Pinky and the Brain. The Brain wanted to take over the famous Warner Bros. Water Tower--and the Warners' lair--and turn it into a rocket. The title of the game came from the duo using hypnosis to put their plan into action.</p><p>The game was likely to be released in 2003 after what seems like an incredibly bumpy road to production. Initially starting as a project for the publisher Conspiracy Entertainment, it was eventually rebooted under another company named Swing Entertainment. It was put aside after Swing entered insolvency proceedings also in 2003, officially putting an end to the project.</p><p>Swing would eventually release Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2005--it would be one of the last Animaniacs games made.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has strongly suggested that the original Switch is about to get more expensive for millions of people. In Canada, Nintendo said it will change prices on the Switch family of consoles, including the Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED.</p><p>Physical and digital Switch games and accessories could be getting more expensive in Canada as well, along with Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions and Amiibo toys.</p><p><a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's announcement</a> did not say if pricing is going up or down--only that a "pricing update" is coming--but many believe this will be a price increase due to the wording specifically mentioning that the changes are coming due to "market conditions." GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Whatever the case, the pricing changes do not apply to the Switch 2 console, games, or accessories. Nintendo of Canada did not announce what the price changes will be, but the company said it will share this information on the Nintendo of Canada website on August 1.</p><p>Recently, US President Donald Trump announced that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/trump-canada-trade-talks-tariffs.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he was ending trade talks with Canada</a> over the country's digital services tax proposal. That's no longer going forward, however, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/30/canada-rescinds-digital-services-tax-after-trump-cuts-off-us-trade-talks.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Canada walking back plans.</a></p><p>The Switch currently sells for $400 CAD, with the Switch OLED going for $450 CAD, and the Switch Lite selling for $260 CAD. The Switch 2, meanwhile, sells for $630 CAD or $700 CAD for the Mario Kart World bundle.</p><p>Many expected the Switch 2 to get more expensive in the US following Nintendo's announcement of the device's price on April 2, which was the same day that Trump announced his "Liberation" tariff plan. While Nintendo did not raise prices on the console in the US, where it sells for $450 or $500 with Mario Kart World, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">did jack up prices on some accessories.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 officially launched on June 5 and became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">fastest-selling console from any company in history.</a></p>

                <p>It's a big day for Game Pass, as the library grows with the addition of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-11-more-games-soon-including-a-great-call-of-duty-game/2900-6674/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6674">underrated Call of Duty game</a>, Call of Duty: WWII. The game is available now on console and PC not just for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but also the less-expensive Game Pass Standard tier.</p><p>Originally released in 2017, Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first WWII-set CoD game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman. The campaign's intensity is ramped up by the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/" data-ref-id="1100-6449627">there is no automatic health regeneration.</a></p><p>CoD: WWII is also fondly remembered by players for its Headquarters social space, which is similar to The Tower from Bungie's Destiny in that it's a big open space <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2s-headquarters-trailer-reveals-its/1100-6452757/" data-ref-id="1100-6452757">where players can mingle together and even challenge players to 1v1 matches.</a> People have been petitioning Activision to bring back Headquarters, or something like it, ever since--but it's never happened.</p><p>The multiplayer mode, meanwhile, was notable for using a simplified "Divisions" system, which replaced the create-a-class system from earlier games. CoD: WWII also has a Nazi Zombies mode. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-wwii-review/1900-6416800/" data-ref-id="1900-6416800">CoD: WWII review</a> scored the game a 9/10.</p><p>In other CoD news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/" data-ref-id="2900-6709">Season 4 Reloaded update for Black Ops 6 and Warzone releases on July 2, adding Beavis and Butt-Head to the game (and lots more).</a> Looking further out, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is coming this year, featuring Gilmore Girls actor Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason.</p>

                <p>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment launched its newest game, the co-op FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a>, in mid-June. The game didn't exactly take the world by storm, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with Steam concurrents topping out under 300 over the last week</a>, and Remedy itself admitting it "had hoped for a better launch." But Steam concurrent numbers do not tell the whole story, of course, and Remedy isn't giving up on Firebreak. Far from it.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha responded to the game's launch and outlined some of what's to come as part of the game's ongoing content roadmap. Puha said the team at Remedy is "super motivated" to build upon FBC and make changes based on player feedback. More than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1 million people</a> have played the game so far, and players haven't wasted time submitting feedback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online," Puha explained.</p><p>We also asked Puha about the decision to bring Firebreak to Game Pass and PlayStation Plus at launch. He said Remedy is still crunching the numbers, but remarked that a "good number" of new players are joining FBC on console every day via the subscription services from Microsoft and Sony.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p>"We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development." -- Remedy's Thomas Puha</p></blockquote><p>Some in the video game industry have questioned whether or not it makes good business sense to launch new games directly into a subscription service, including those who have done just that. Recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">the developer of the day-one Game Pass release Revenge of the Savage Planet questioned whether it was indeed a good idea to launch the game into Game Pass</a>, citing concerns about the "devaluation" of content. We don't know about the financial specifics for any deals Remedy may have made for Firebreak, however. At the same time, others have argued that launching directly into a subscription service could be a recipe for success to help a game reach a wider audience out of the gate.</p><p>Beyond financial performance, Puha said it's "pretty clear" that although people who may join Firebreak from Game Pass or PS Plus might not stick with the game for as long as someone who may have bought the game outright, "it's also easier for them to return."</p><p>Puha also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">reiterated</a> that Firebreak was never designed to require people to play every day to unlock daily login rewards or anything that could make it feel like playing Firebreak was "your other job." The game was purposefully designed to not take over your life, he said. "Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of major updates," he said. "We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development."</p><p>While Puha said Remedy has already had to make key strategic decisions like prioritizing some areas and deprioritizing others due to the feedback at launch, he said fans can expect Remedy to stick with FBC. "Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year," he said.</p><p>You can read our full interview with Puha below.</p><p>Next up for Firebreak is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3 patch</a>, which is targeting release early this week. Remedy said the patch aims to "enhanced the overall game experience" with things like changes to the game's perk economy. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-bringing-major-changes-to-fbc-firebreak-after-launch-backlash/1100-6532591/" data-ref-id="1100-6532591">previous patch that responded to some initial frustrations</a> with the game about the onboarding and progression, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/" data-ref-id="1900-6418376">FBC: Firebreak review</a> scored the game an 8/10. "FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects," reviewer Mark Delaney wrote.</p><p>Remedy's ongoing support for Firebreak is just one of the development efforts that remains ongoing at the company. The Finnish studio is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-enters-full-production-as-alan-wake-2-has-finally-recouped-development-costs/1100-6529420/" data-ref-id="1100-6529420">Control 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/">remakes of Max Payne and May Payne 2.</a></p><p><b>Can you speak to the Steam numbers for FBC so far, and how do you view Steam in terms of importance relative to console in the overall mix?</b></p><p>Steam is a very important part of the business of FBC: Firebreak. The Steam CCU is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn't everything.</p><p>We aren't naïve; we had hoped for a better launch, but the team here is super-motivated to continue building the game and responding to player feedback. We already reacted during launch week with patch 1.2, making some big changes to the game. As Remedy does, we'll do things with smaller teams in our way and try to solve challenges creatively.</p><p><b>What can Remedy say about launching FBC directly into Game Pass and PS Plus? Did this have the desired results for Remedy thus far?</b></p><p>Subscription services are an easy way for a large number of players to try the game, and it's great for cross-platform matchmaking--you have more folks to play with.</p><p>Being on these services also makes it easy for players to return when we release new updates and exciting new content.</p><p><b>What trends has Remedy observed for the Game Pass/PS Plus audience relative to people who may have bought the game outright? Are you seeing people who have never played a Remedy game before try it out, thanks to the subscription offering?</b></p><p>It's very early days, and we have a lot of data, which is very helpful for a game like this. We can see there is a significant number of FBC: Firebreak players who, for example, don't own Control. The game's a bit bewildering for them, to say the least, but we are going to improve on that significantly. Then, it's pretty clear that players from subscription services tend to stick around for shorter periods than those who purchased the game, but it's also easier for them to return. There is a good number of new players coming in every day on consoles.</p><p><b>What are some efforts you might take to help grow the FBC player base and retain the players you have already?</b></p><p>The simple answer is to develop and release great content to the game now that it's live. Post-launch content, as we have always said, will be free. Listen to the player base to understand what they want; their opinion is what matters, while ensuring that Remedy's creativity remains in the mix.</p><p>We never designed the game to be something that requires daily login for some random stuff, making the game your other job. Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of Major Updates.</p><p>We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development.</p><p>One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online.</p><p>The drive within the Remedy development team is incredible to see, but of course, the content ultimately will decide what players think, not words.</p><p>It's been interesting to examine the data and feedback, and see that players who spent many hours playing the experience rated the game significantly higher than those who ended it early. So we know we've got something great at the core of the game.</p><p>We didn’t do a great job at all with onboarding and what we call the “first hours” progression, so players' frustration at the beginning of the game is understandable when there are a lot of systems thrown at you with little explanation, and the tier 1 weapons weren’t hitting that hard amongst other things.</p><p><b>What level of ongoing support can FBC players expect going forward as it relates to new content and updates?</b></p><p>Let's keep in mind the game is barely a week and a half old. We have a lot to process.</p><p>We outlined our post-launch plans before releasing the game, so there are two new Jobs and features coming in 2025. That's still the case.</p><p>Ultimately, we always knew that the launch of these types of games would have an impact on our post-launch roadmap. As it has proven to be, we've rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live. The game is live, players' feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.</p><p>We relied more on building game systems that we can expand in the future, and we can do so, so much more. We are going to discuss what's coming to the game in the near future. It takes time to review the feedback, assess what's possible, and communicate it.</p><p>It's exciting that the game starts evolving now that its live, Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year.</p>

                <p>Believe it or not, the Bandai Namco fighter-jet series Ace Combat is now three decades old. To commemorate the anniversary of the first game's release in Japan on June 30, 1995, the company has put out a neat video showing off how the series has evolved over time.</p><p>The short movie highlights clips from various Ace Combat games, giving a glimpse of how the colorful PlayStation 1 art of Air Combat (the first entry in the series) transformed into the hyper-realistic near-future science-fiction of the later entries, such as Ace Combat 7.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYWwUqkBXAI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYWwUqkBXAI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the series sizzle reel, the video also teases some projects in the works to further celebrate the anniversary. For instance, Bandai Namco overhauled the Ace Combat website, and it announced <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/30th-anniversary-event1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a special symphony</a> to be held on January 31, 2026 at Japan's Saitama Kaikan concert hall. Bandai Namco also shared that additional projects will be announced beginning in July.</p><p>It's cool to see how far Ace Combat has come since the early days. Being roughly the same age as the series and having grown up in the 2000s, I have a soft spot for Ace Combat 5 and Ace Combat 6. I remember playing the fifth game for hours at kiosks in local Targets, and the sixth was one of the first games I owned on my Xbox 360.</p><p>For those of you who, like me, are looking forward to seeing what the Ace Combat team can do with modern hardware, we'll likely still have to wait for a while. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ace-combat-game-confirmed-new-developer-involved/1100-6495310/" data-ref-id="1100-6495310">announced back in 2021</a> that a new game is in the works, but there's been little additional information since then. It does seem like work continues, though: In <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/fan-message/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post to fans</a> today, series brand director Kazutoki Kono wrote, "We're ready. Everything is in place. It's time to take flight once again--toward even greater heights."</p>
