                <p dir="ltr">Razer has announced the next generation of its Razer Blade 16 gaming laptop as part of its CES 2025 lineup. The new model looks to not only be a powerful rig with impressive gaming specs, it's also the company's thinnest gaming laptop yet.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Razer Blade 16 features a 0.59-inch chassis, which is 32% thinner than the previous Razer Blade 16 model. Razer has made other adjustments to the laptop's design to accommodate the smaller size without impacting durability, cooling, or usability. The new laptop has a metal body made from a single piece of anodized aluminum and features vapor chamber cooling. The redesign also includes a new keyboard with 1.5mm travel, which is 50% more key travel than the previous model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423411" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423411"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 16 2025 Model</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Razer Blade 16 will be available with multiple hardware configuration options, with the highest-end model sporting an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. Other components will be detailed later. All models feature a 16-inch OLED display with 3200 x 1800 pixel QHD+ resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.2ms response time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Razer Blade 16 2025 model will be available sometime in Q1 2025. Pricing and preorder availability have not yet been announced, but you can <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/notify-me" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up to be notified at Razer's website.</a></p><p dir="ltr">The new Razer Blade 16 is Razer's first big CES announcement, but we expect the manufacturer will have more to announce throughout the week. Plenty of other companies have also announced new PC gaming hardware, including AMD's upcoming Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards and Ryzen 9 99503XD CPUs launching early this year.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-iphone-and-android-controller-is-50-off/1100-6524903/">Backbone One iPhone And Android Controller Is 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazios-massive-official-strategy-guide-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6528507/">Metaphor: ReFantazio Is Getting A Nearly 600-Page Official Strategy Guide</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-strategy-guides-finally-restocked-at-amazon-get-all-three-while-you-can/1100-6524739/">Elden Ring Strategy Guides Finally Restocked At Amazon - Get All Three While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-buy-doorbuster-deal-xbox-elite-series-2-controller-is-only-120-and-amazon-is-matching/1100-6528306/">Best Buy Doorbuster Deal: Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller Is Only $120, And Amazon Is Matching</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Today at CES 2025, AMD announced its new 9070-series graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. While the company did not reveal prices or availability for these new components, it did offer a preview of the new GPUs' features and performance.</p><p dir="ltr">Specific specs were not disclosed during the company's presentation, both the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are built on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, featuring AMD’s second-gen AI accelerators, second-gen radiance display engine, and third-gen ray-tracing accelerators. AMD claims the performance benchmarks will be roughly in the range of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. That would put the RX 9070 series within a mid-range line of GPUs, rather high-end models--though we're curious to see how they'll stack up against Nvidia's upcoming RTX 5000-series GPUs, which are also expected to be unveiled at CES this week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407"></a><figcaption>Several manufacturers are readying Radeon 9070 series GPUs for launch early this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What was confirmed, however, is that the GPUs' RNA 4 architecture will support the new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) AI-powered resolution upscaling, which AMD also previewed at CES. FSR is similar to Nvidia's DLSS and PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaling tech (which was based on FSR), but FSR 4 is built specifically for the RX 9070 series' new AI accelerators. FSR 4 will launch alongside the new Radeon 9070 GPUs and will support any games that already use FSR 3.1 and above, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as confirmed by Microsoft's Matt Booty during AMD's presentation. The company did not specify how FSR 4 upscaling will compare to its current FSR 3.5 or Nvidia's DLSS.</p><p dir="ltr">AMD did not reveal prices or specific release dates for the Radeon RX 9070 GPUs, but the first wave is expected to launch in Q1 2025, with models planned from multiple manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte, and more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New Ryzen 9 Flagship CPUs</h2><p dir="ltr">Alongside these new GPUs, AMD also unveiled its new flagship desktop CPUs, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, during its CES 2025 presentation. Pricing and specific release date were once again not confirmed, but we did get a more concrete release window of March 2025, and a clearer overview of its specs and performance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406"></a><figcaption>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 16 Zen 5 CPU cores (32 threads), a maximum boost frequency of 5.7GHz, 144MB of total cache, and 170 watt TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D features 12 cores (24 threads), a 5.5GHz maximum boost, 140MB of cache, and a 120-watt TDP. AMD says the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is 10% faster on average than Intel's current Core Ultra 9 285K flagship CPU, and up to 20% faster for gaming. Its gaming performance benchmarks are also within 1% of AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is widely considered the best gaming CPU currently on the market--and one that is notoriously difficult to find in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D are both set to launch in March, but no prices have been revealed yet.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're in the market for an AMD processor but don't want to wait, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has restocked the popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU for $479</a>.
