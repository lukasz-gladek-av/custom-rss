                <p>It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><p>Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:</p><ul><li><strong>December 18</strong>: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 19</strong>: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 20</strong>: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)</li></ul><p>As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.</p><p>Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a>, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">is available for preorder now</a>.

                <p>Fanatical is closing 2025 out with a new build-your-own bundle deal, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+25+PC+Games+For+%2464+With+This+New+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-12-16+15%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-16+15%3A57%3A04&amp;fnarticle_id=6536985&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbest-of-platinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-22-games-for-under-65-at-fanatical%2F1100-6536985%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best of Platinum Collection</a>. This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment.</p><p>One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech. So, really, if you decide to add this to the Best of Platinum Collection, it could be a total of 25 games. The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.</p><p>With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.</p><p>For you horror fans, one of the biggest highlights of the Platinum Collection is the inclusion of Amnesia: The Bunker. The Amnesia games are some of the most tense, atmospheric, and terrifying survival horror games to be found in the genre, and getting it at this price is a steal.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Platinum Collection, including the narrative-driven RPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, the hidden FPS gem RoboCop: Rogue City, the Lego-themed puzzle game Lego Bricktales, and more. Check out the full list below.</p><h2>Fanatical Best of Platinum Collection: Build Your Own Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Amnesia: The Bunker</li><li>Botany Manor</li><li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</li><li>Doom (2016)</li><li>Dungeon Tycoon</li><li>Dysmantle</li><li>Edge of Sanity</li><li>Endless Alice</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Fallout 76</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder</li><li>The Isletide Hotel</li><li>LEGO Brick Tales</li><li>Mini Settlers</li><li>Neon Garten</li><li>The Pale Beyond</li><li>Paradise Killer</li><li>Reveil</li><li>RoboCop: Rogue City</li><li>SteamWorld Build</li><li>SteamWorld Classic Bundle</li></ul><p>If none of these games are quite your bag or you're after something different, there are plenty of other bundle deals through Fanatical.
