                <p>It's been 12 years since Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, but the musician has found a new big venue where he can sing without even leaving his home. This weekend, the hit Roblox game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steal-a-brainrot/" data-ref-id="5000-682152">Steal a Brainrot</a> is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.</p><p>The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p><p>Although musical acts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-stray-kids-are-coming-to-roblox/1100-6537123/" data-ref-id="1100-6537123">Stray Kids</a> have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.</p><p>To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.</p><p>Steal a Brainrot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/" data-ref-id="5000-681260">Grow a Garden</a>, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-switch-2-and-brainrot-dominated-the-youtube-trends-of-2025/1100-6536632/" data-ref-id="1100-6536632">the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025</a>.

According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a>, the platform has had major issues with child predators. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> even sued Roblox over that issue.</p><p>Roblox has since introduced initiatives to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">keep children from talking to strangers</a>, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age.

                <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s Season 2 launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-update-delayed-to-help-refine-the-content-after-fan-feedback/1100-6537352/" data-ref-id="1100-6537352">was pushed back to February 17</a> to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.</p><p>Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take "approximately 40% more hits" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.</p><p>Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve "responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer." The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.</p><p>Since Season 1 has been extended, Battlefield Studios is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-delay-adds-more-challenges-cosmetics-and-double-xp-to-season-1/1100-6537406/" data-ref-id="1100-6537406">adding new weekly challenges</a> and a Frostfire bonus path that includes a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items. Season pass owners will also be able to get a weapon package, an XP boost for your entire career, and more cosmetics.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 are below, and they will go live on January 20 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h3><ul><li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li><li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li><li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li></ul><h3>Changelog</h3><h3>Vehicles</h3><p>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</p><p>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><ul><li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li><li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li><li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li><li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li><li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li><li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li><li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks.
