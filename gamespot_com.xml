                <p>Decades ago, Atari games were some of the first titles to leap from arcades to home consoles. Now, a small selection of Atari's re-imagined classics are heading to AirConsole, an entertainment and gaming platform designed exclusively for cars.</p><p>AirConsole and Atari <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/airconsole-brings-legendary-atari-arcade-games-to-cars-302507956.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that Asteroids Recharged and Breakout Charged are now playable for the in-vehicle entertainment system that is currently available in supported Volkswagen models. To play the games, drivers need an active VW Connect Plus contract and an internet connection on a smartphone. However, the games will only work if the car is parked. Once players scan the accompanying QR codes, their phones become the controllers for the AirConsole titles.</p><p>"The AirConsole team has a phenomenal track record of optimizing the in-car controls and producing amazing playing experiences in vehicles," said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a statement. "We are excited for Volkswagen drivers and their passengers to discover these modern versions of our classic titles."</p><p>Atari will eventually add Missile Command: Recharged to its AirConsole lineup, but no other specific titles were mentioned by name. AirConsole is also working with carmakers Audi and BMW, but the Atari games are currently only available through Volkswagen cars.</p><p>Earlier this year, Atari announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">a new version of the 1984 arcade game I, Robot</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout Beyond</a>, an updated title that was originally intended to be released on Intellivision's Amico, a console that has yet to launch.</p>

Dressed to kill, this Operator is being released to promote the new entry in the horror film franchise. "Last summer, they know what you did. This summer, the Fisherman's in your lobby," the message reads for the brief teaser trailer.</p><p>While it doesn't have a number attached to it, I Know What You Did Last Summer is the fourth film in the slasher series, and it's a direct sequel to 1998's I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Set 27 years after the Tower Bay murders, the movie features a new hook-wielding killer on the loose targeting a group of friends, one year after they covered up a car crash in which they may have killed someone. The movie premiered on July 18 to mixed reviews, and so far, it has scared up a worldwide box office gross of $24.6 million.</p><p>A release date for Fisherman--who bears a striking resemblance to the <a href="https://youtu.be/vgIY_U6Npxg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hash-Slinging Slasher</a> from SpongeBob SquarePants--has not been announced, but they are expected to debut in Season Five of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This new reveal follows hot on the heels of several surprising crossovers in the game, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/" data-ref-id="1100-6533245">American Dad</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis &amp; Butt-Head</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">Eve Macarro from the John Wick spin-off Ballerina</a> have all been added in recent weeks.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-now-asking-players-to-verify-their-age/1100-6533243/" data-ref-id="1100-6533243">a new age-verification measure is being added</a>, and Treyarch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was recently announced with a slick trailer.</p>

People can expect to see gameplay footage and hear directly from developers, the report said.</p><p>Insider Gaming also reported that some influencers are being sent care packages pointing to an upcoming announcement. The post referenced above has since been deleted, but Insider-Gaming said it's legitimate.</p><p>Officially speaking, EA has said it will officially announce the new Battlefield game sometime this summer. Fans theorized it might happen in June alongside the industry's other major gaming events, and when that didn't happen, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">EA boss assured fans a reveal was still coming sometime later.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details on the reveal plans for the next Battlefield.</p><p>EA is currently allowing some people to play Battlefield 6 through a limited closed alpha test.
