                <p>The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Activision Blizzard over claims that the mobile games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile engage in "misleading and aggressive practices."</p><p><a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The watchdog said</a> the games are structured in such a way to encourage people to "play more often, extend their gaming sessions, and take up promoted offers" through "the possible use of deceptive user-interface design."</p><p>"Examples include repeated prompts, both during and outside gameplay, urging users not to miss out on rewards--also through in-app messages and push notifications--as well as to purchase time-limited items before they become unavailable," the group said.</p><p>"These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers--including minors--leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved."</p><p>The group further claims that the parental controls in Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile default to options "that offer a lower level of protection for minors," including allowing in-game purchases, social features, and "unlimited play time."</p><p>The Italian Competition Authority also said it wants to look into how Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile go about collecting personal data. "It seems that consumers--including minors--are led to select all consent options, including consent to profiling for commercial purposes, in the belief that they are faced with a mandatory choice," the group said.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment. The company and its franchises are now owned by Microsoft following the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout.</p>
