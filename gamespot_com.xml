                <p dir="ltr">With a planned release in the next few months, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/">The Game Awards</a> seems like a fitting stage to reintroduce the long-gestating Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake. But that's not part of Ubisoft's plans, according to the Prince of Persia account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The official social media channel poured cold water on a fan account speculating that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will show up at The Game Awards on December 11. "Sorry to disappoint but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at [The Game Awards] this year," the Prince of Persia account states.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖</p>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In June, Ubisoft noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-once-again-promises-that-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-on-the-way/1100-6532466/">the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31</a>--the end of the company's current fiscal year. That was the second time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/">Ubisoft stuck to that release timeline</a>, too. However, it's been a bumpy road for the game since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">being announced in 2020</a>. For instance, in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-changes-developers/1100-6503046/" data-ref-id="1100-6503046">the Prince of Persia remake switched developers to Ubisoft Montreal</a>, the original team behind the Sands of Time series. Before that, Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai were working on the title.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time released in 2003 on PC, PS2, GameCube, and Xbox. From a marketing perspective, Ubisoft might want to focus on The Rogue Prince of Persia, as <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996263159556878586" rel="nofollow ">it's coming to Switch and Switch 2</a> on December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, there are other questions swirling around The Game Awards. The biggest one relates to a statue that showed up in a desert, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">people guessing the teaser relates to Diablo 4 or a new God of War</a>. However, there's been pushback that neither is correct.</p>
