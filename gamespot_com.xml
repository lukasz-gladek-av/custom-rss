<section><p>Like gaming, Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Formula 1, also known as F1, is a hot topic as of late and one of the world’s most popular sports. Whether it's topping the box office with a film starring Brad Pitt, or literally building a track smack in the middle of Las Vegas and hosting a race there, there’s a surging interest in the highly popular international motorsport. While on the surface, Formula 1 seems to be another Grand Prix sport in which drivers test their mettle on the track, diving deeper into the sport reveals a highly competitive battle of technical prowess on and off the track. In many ways, Formula 1 is like playing a video game, in which your gear and build matters right down to the very last detail, making it feel unlike any other sport out there. In fact, I'd argue Formula 1 is <em>the </em>sport to check out if you’re into gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with the basics, namely: what is Formula 1 and how exactly does it differ from other Grand Prix racing leagues that are fairly common but far less popular? In most other leagues, drivers and teams are required to use the same chassis and vehicle specifications. For example, in NASCAR, every driver uses the same type of vehicle, and the racing advantage comes down to pure skill in the moment-to-moment racing. That’s not the case in Formula 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Each F1 team is instead given a series of broad guidelines, specifications, and a budget: a “Formula” for them to follow. Using these guidelines, the teams literally build their race vehicles from scratch, using a fleet of engineers and mechanics. Because every team is able to build their own vehicle, the teams look for every advantage they can in the design and build, right down to the smallest detail. This results in vehicles that have more in common with jets and spacecraft than they do the average car you would see on the street.</p><p dir="ltr">To make matters more interesting, each team has to actually build their vehicle <em>twice, </em>because in the rules of Formula 1, each team is required to have two drivers and two vehicles. And while these drivers cannot communicate with one another, having two racers makes it vital that they are in constant communication with their team boss and engineers. Through radio contact, teams can switch up strategies and make changes to gameplans situations on the fly in the heat of a race, much like how teammate communication would work in a first-person shooter or MOBA video game.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the cars are built, it's finally time to hit the track. Grand Prix events, a series of races in a championship series, in Formula 1 are typically split up into four different races: two practice rounds, one qualifier, and the Grand Prix race itself. In the practice rounds, drivers do exactly what is implied: they practice. In racing leagues such as NASCAR, the tracks are typically a round oval-like shape, providing a consistent driving experience throughout the race. Formula 1 shakes things up by featuring tracks that are filled with sharp turns and straightaways throughout. Because of this--and the fact that highly experimental vehicles are being used--drivers need to acquaint themselves with the track. Using these practice rounds, teams can also make adjustments to their vehicles and factor variables such as weather and track temperature into their final modifications and tire selection. Imagine it like playing a particularly difficult track in a racing game to learn it before hopping into an online match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998"></a><figcaption>EA's F1 25 is the latest entry in the popular series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Actually, let's talk a bit more about games here. Most racing games pride themselves on being accurate simulations of their respective motorsports. From Gran Turismo to EA’s yearly F1 franchise, recreating the motorsport experience is a priority for these games. Simulations are also essential to Formula 1 as well, as drivers use advanced simulators to recreate their cars and tracks without ever having to step on the pavement. With state of the art technologies and a smart use of screens and driving rigs, drivers are able to run <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/sim-racers-rejoice-f1-champ-max-verstappen-says-youre-getting-a-90-to-95-percent-accurate-experience-even-without-that-megabucks-motion-rig/" rel="nofollow ">near-exact replicas</a> of situations they’ll face in the race.</p><p dir="ltr">After practice is where it really starts to count. With all the knowledge the drivers and teams have gained during the practice rounds, they race in a qualifier to compete for starting position in the race. The coveted pole position also known as “P1,” the frontmost starting position, is what the teams strive for, and every further position is considered a disadvantage that could literally add seconds to lap time.</p><p dir="ltr">After starting positions are established comes the real-deal race, in which the teams earn points for the season score based on finishing position. It’s no-holds-barred, and teams are expected to operate at peak performance right down to the smallest detail.</p><p dir="ltr">During the race, when drivers are forced to make pit stops for tire swaps and repairs, the pit crew is expected to have the drivers back out on the course in two seconds or less--and often do. Even choosing when to have these pit stops is considered a tactical decision that is given a great deal of thought and consideration. That’s why teams not only earn points for driving, but also for pit and engineering teams. The Grand Prix event repeats multiple times throughout the season, and at the end, the winning team is crowned for their technical and physical skills, on and off the track. The outcome affects budgets for teams in the following year' the winning team receives less budget to work with than runner-up teams, meaning that other teams will have a chance to catch up from a tech standpoint.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Formula 1 feels like gaming--even for someone who is not actively participating. In most sports, gear and builds don’t factor into performance, but Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, Nico Hulkenberg’s third-place podium win from a P19 starting position, making it his first podium win in 239 races, a feat not thought possible from a “weaker” team. As someone who’s heavily into Diablo, I can’t help but see parallels between streamlining and tinkering with a character build of mine for the highest damage output and putting it to the test in endless repeatable dungeons, and seeing a Formula 1 team made adjustments and modifications to shave seconds off of their fastest lap time. When everything clicks in, gaming and Formula 1 actions can run like clockwork and provide a grand sense of accomplishment especially when critical thinking is applied.</p>

                <p>Playing defense is one of the most crucial elements to success in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. While you might want to sim through all of the defensive series in a game or just use the coach's suggestion plays to get through a drive, you can really turn the tide of a game if you actually concentrate on defense.</p><p>If you want to make that job easier on yourself, it's imperative to use the right defensive playbook in College Football 26. A majority of the game modes allow you to select any team's playbook on offense and defense, giving you freedom to choose what kind of plays you have access to.</p><p>Of course, defensive plays are a little trickier to understand than offensive ones. So, to make matters simpler, you can take a look below at our picks for the best defensive formations and playbooks available in CFB 26. If you make your own custom playbook and combine these formations We've already covered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">best offensive playbooks</a> if you want to check out that side of the ball.</p><h2>Best defensive schemes in College Football 26</h2><p>When it comes to selecting a defensive playbook, you have to consider a few different factors. You need to determine if you want to run a specific kind of defense and what that defense is. Of course, you can also select a solid all-around playbook that features plays from various formations, giving you access to a wide selection of plays.</p><p>Fortunately, we've got you covered regardless of your preferences. Below, you can see our pick for the best schemes, collectively making up the best defensive playbook in the game.</p><h3>3-4 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg"></figure><p>Let's start off with a classic. The modern 3-4 Defense was popularized by now North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick during his 40+ years in the NFL. In CFB 26, it's arguably the best standard defense that covers all of your bases when it comes to countering what play an offense will run.</p><p>In 3-4, you'll have three defensive linemen and four linebackers on the field. 3-4 relies on some stability from the interior of the defense, which means your defensive tackles and inside linebackers need to ensure they're covering the middle of the field. However, you also don't want to leave any passing lanes exposed, which is where your other linebackers come into play. For 3-4, you generally want to user the middle linebacker to cover passing lanes or possibly the defensive tackle to try and get pressure on the opposing quarterback.</p><h3>3-3-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg"></figure><p>Next up, we have an alternate defensive playbook, which uses the 3-3-5 defense. This defensive formation utilizes three down defensive linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. Naturally, with one less lineman/linebacker, you're going to have to get creative when it comes to pressuring the quarterback.</p><p>Fortunately, the 3-3-5 defense utilizes plenty of safety and cornerback pressures to compensate for the missing pass rusher. You can also use your six linemen and linebackers to shoot different gaps on passing and rushing plays. 3-3-5 defense can come with some risk if you don't guess the right play or make the correct pre-snap adjustments, but it can also be a truly difficult defense to play against if you can cover all your bases.</p><h3>3-2-6 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg"></figure><p>The 3-2-6 defense is one you want to use if you're overly worried about defending against the pass in CFB 26. Utilizing six defensive backs and only two traditional linebackers, you'll have a difficult time getting any consistent pressure on the quarterback with this defense. However, that abundance of DBs makes it incredibly difficult for the quarterback to find any open receiver.</p><p>Moreover, the defense often makes use of speedier linebackers that drop into coverage as well, meaning you might only have three defensive linemen trying to stop the run and get to the quarterback. As long as you can predict when a pass is coming and use the right plays accordingly, the 3-2-6 defense will be a thorn in the side of any opponent that wishes to pass to ball.</p><h3>4-2-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, we have the 4-2-5 defense, which is a mix between the 3-2-6 and 3-3-5 defenses. Compared to the 3-2-6 defense, which is all about defending against the pass, the 4-2-5 focuses more on defending the run and getting to the quarterback. While you do still have five defensive backs in the mix, one of them is often responsible for applying pressure from the outside. This, mixed with four down defensive linemen and a linebacker or two, makes getting to the quarterback much easier.</p><p>Of course, what makes the 4-2-5 great is that you also have some flexibility to defend against the pass. You can use all five DBs to drop into coverage along with your two linebackers. On plays where the offense takes some time to develop, you can cover all receivers and possibly get to the quarterback with your four linemen. Quick passing plays might beat the 4-2-5, though, so watch out for those.</p>

                <p>As one of the biggest games in the world, Fortnite has long had its fair share of bad actors targeting it and its players. Epic Games has responded over the years by beefing up its safety and security capacities and investing in protective measures to ensure the stability of the game.</p><p>Recently, Epic took legal action against two individuals, a cheat seller and the perpetrator of a string of DDoS attacks against Fortnite creators. According to Epic's comments on the matter, the DDoSer had been disrupting livestreams of Fortnite content, in addition to conducting "stream sniping" campaigns. The other person, meanwhile, had been selling and using permanent Fortnite bans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1944788275711054250" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We took legal action against two people who cheated and broke our rules:<br>One sold and used cheats and the other carried out cyber attacks on content creators who were livestreaming gameplay (aka: DDoS attacks).

Their social media accounts have also been scrubbed of content.</p><p>In their apology video, the DDoSer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD-KyTph9DI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zebsi</a>, shared that they carried out the cyberattacks under a particular username. They also apologized for the "damage" the attacks did to Epic, the community, and the targeted streamers. The cheat seller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqijCVqMGM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirrored</a>, admitted to using, selling, and distributing "cheats and hardware," and they said that they had cheated in Fortnite tournaments. They also shared that they were permanently banned from the game and would face additional legal action if they cheated again.</p><p>Epic has taken a hard line against cheating in abuse in recent times, and this move to force public apologies from two individuals is a clear example of the company's efforts to increase deterrence.

A number of new Overwatch 2 features have also drawn comparisons to Marvel Rivals, including the recent reveal of the third-person <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Stadium mode</a>. But according to Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, Stadium mode and other features weren't made in response to Marvel Rivals. Instead, many of them were planned before Marvel Rivals debuted.</p><p>"I think that competition is healthy," said Keller during a guest appearance on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2508946186" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay3's stream</a>. "It does force people to innovate more and to always be putting your best foot forward, but I don't think what you're seeing in Overwatch 2 right now is a response to Marvel Rivals. So much of what we were doing this year--from perks to Stadium to map voting, we did full hero bans--so much of what we're doing here and all the heroes we're releasing has been in the works for over a year as part of a new strategy for the game to have a big annual kick off to the year."</p><p>Keller suggested that there may things added to Overwatch 2 in the future if the games are still actively competing, but he didn't add any specifics beyond that. During the same stream, Keller acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-director-acknowledges-that-game-needs-more-story-content-to-be-firing-on-all-cylinders/1100-6533118/" data-ref-id="1100-6533118">Overwatch 2 has had very little of the story content, cinematics, and animated shorts</a> that helped define the world in the first game. However, he expressed a desire to place more emphasis on story in the future.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-g-i-joe-costumes-in-july/1100-6532738/" data-ref-id="1100-6532738">Overwatch 2 x G.I. Joe collaboration</a> began earlier this month and ends today, July 14. Some of the previous collaborations included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-x-transformers-collaboration-trailer-unites-the-heroes-of-two-worlds/1100-6524772/" data-ref-id="1100-6524772">a few Transformers-inspired costumes</a>, as well as some from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-collaboration-is-a-match-made-in-heaven/1100-6531643/" data-ref-id="1100-6531643">Street Fighter</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.

                <p>The next Nintendo Direct might be coming up very soon. That's according to reputable source Nate the Hate, who said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> today, July 14, that the next Direct is slated for this month.</p><p>"It is the million dollar question. I have been told there is a Direct this month, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases," he said. "Beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point."</p><p>Bananza launches on July 17 for Switch 2, so a possible Direct would happen after that if this report proves to be accurate.</p><p>That's all he had to say about a possible upcoming Direct. Nintendo could have any number of things to announce at a Direct, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">potential Donkey Kong movie</a> or confirmation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>. Activision is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">keen to bring Call of Duty to Switch.</a></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents event slated for July 22</a>. Nate the Hate pointed out that this Nintendo-adjacent event <em>and </em>a Nintendo Direct in the same week is not unprecedented, but he feels safer speculating that the July Direct could happen during the last week of the month instead. If that's true, it would happen just before Nintendo releases its latest earnings results on August 1.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on June 18 and was exclusively dedicated to Bananza. Before that, there was the big Switch 2 Direct on April 2 and then a Mario Kart World Direct on April 17. Nintendo did not hold a Nintendo Direct event in July 2024 or July 2023, but that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-X7hRDf7qr3vJ94YQpTr-eGgfDvyx6gP0lkrBREZtbPWVlMDV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a> might not mean anything. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>You might also want to keep an eye on the Nintendo Today app, as Nintendo is known to make announcements there just ahead of sharing information in other places.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How The Fallout TV Show Shapes Fallout's Future</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Corden said from what he has heard, part of the forward push for Fallout 5 and Fallout in general came at the expense of ZeniMax Online's next MMO, codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceled as part of Microsoft's latest round of layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As Corden explains, MMOs are expensive to build and have to compete with established games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and even ZeniMax's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. With that in mind, Microsoft made the decision to cancel ZeniMax's unannounced project and invest that money into Fallout, an established IP that would more likely be a "surefire win."</p><p dir="ltr">"From what I heard, it was a case of 'Do we want to sink a ton of money into getting this [project Blackbird] to a point where it can compete with the established players in the market, or do we want to allocate that investment towards making Fallout 5?'" Corden said.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that Corden states that he doesn't have enough information to write a full story about Fallout 5 or who may be developing it, so it's worth taking the information above with a grain of salt.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Blackbird was still in pre-production when it was canceled, but no official details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-revealed-about-elder-scrolls-online-devs-rumored-canceled-game/1100-6532943/" data-ref-id="1100-6532943">next game from the Elder Scrolls Online dev</a> had been announced. It had reportedly been in development since 2018, ran on a new engine, and was to be a new sci-fi IP. Development on the game was said to have been going well and had begun ramping up, with higher-ups at Xbox seemingly approving of the game just a few months prior to cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of who is developing Fallout 5, the fact that it is just now greenlit means it will likely be many years before it releases. However, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly in the works</a> that could arrive sooner.
