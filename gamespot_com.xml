This makes for a fast-paced game focused on combat and exploration that's easy to set up and learn, but still offers much of the customization, continuity, and replayability of pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The game originally launched in 1989 and was out of print for several years until it returned with the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HeroQuest-Tabletop-Immersive-Fantasy-Adventure/dp/B08Q4J1XHZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HeroQuest Game System (2nd Edition)</a></strong>, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. You can pick up a copy for $91.60 at Amazon, which is very close to the lowest price this year. Though the retailer briefly sold it for under $50 in early 2024, the price has trended up ever since--it hasn't dropped below $85 since Black Friday. The price has bounced between $90 and $110 throughout 2025 (so far). HeroQuest's MSRP is $135.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a cheaper path to accessing the new expansion.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Nightreign</a> is designed as a three-player co-op journey that aims to challenge players' combat abilities, having them work together to bring down tough bosses and explore a shifting map. While you can play Nightreign as a solo player, the game is focused on pairing you with two other players for you all to fight and explore together. Fortunately, both the single-player and multiplayer functions in Elden Ring Nightreign are easy to use, allowing you to minimize your time between expeditions into the Living Lands.</p><p>Below, we'll show you everything you need to know about how to start expeditions and how to set up both single-player and co-op multiplayer runs in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as the lack of proper cross-play support.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_expeditions_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to start expeditions in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, let's go over how to actually get into expeditions once you're past the tutorial of the game that occurs within the first 10 or so minutes.</p><p>After the tutorial, you'll find yourself at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a>, a familiar location for Elden Ring fans. At the Roundtable Hold, you can interact with a variety of NPCs, but the main area you'll spend the majority of your time in is right in the center at the table itself. When you approach the central table, you'll get a prompt to "Commence Expedition," which you want to press.</p><p>When you choose to commence an expedition, the boss menu in Nightreign will appear on your screen. This lists all the current bosses you can hunt down in the game, providing a brief background on each one so you know what you're up against. Before you choose a boss, though, you want to tab over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-psa-guide/1100-6531878/" data-ref-id="1100-6531878">Matchmaking</a> Settings by using the bumpers on your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397"></a><figcaption>Starting an expedition with the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png"></figure><p>On the Matchmaking Settings menu, you're able to invite members to your party, create a password for your friends to use and join your group, and even change your Expedition Type to switch between single-player and multiplayer.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_solo_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First up, if you want to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign, all you have to do is change the Expedition Type from the default "multiplayer" to "singleplayer." These are your only two options, so switching the type once will do the trick.</p><p>Once you have switched your Expedition Type, you can head into the boss menu, select your boss, and then commence a solo expedition. As a note, you'll default to the class that you currently have equipped in the Roundtable Hold, as you have no teammates to go through the class selection screen with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400"></a><figcaption>Going through Nightreign in a party of one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png"></figure><p>Other than that, everything is the exact same as it is in the multiplayer expeditions. You can do the same things, fight the same enemies, and try to defeat all of the bosses to eventually reach the final boss. Of course, as a solo player, this is incredibly hard, and once you die a single time, you're dead for good since you can't be revived.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_multiplayer_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play multiplayer in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now, let's get into playing Elden Ring Nightreign the way the developers intended. By default, your Expedition Type is set to multiplayer, so if you want to play with two random players, all you have to do is commence an expedition, pick your boss, and then the game will take care of the rest. You'll be automatically matched with two other real players, and then the character selection screen will appear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401"></a><figcaption>The tutorial box for setting up team expeditions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png"></figure><p>Only one person can select any particular class, so if a player gets to your favorite class, you need to have a backup or two. Once the characters have been chosen, all three of you will drop onto a map together, and you can start playing from there. There's no limit to staying near your teammates, so feel free to do whatever you think is best. However, you'll eventually wind up with your teammates at the end of the day as the zone encroaches around the map.</p><p>On the flip side, if you want to play with your friends instead of random players, you can do that from the Matchmaking Settings menu as well. All you have to do is select the "Invite Members" option from the menu, which brings up a list of your online friends from your platform. If you invite players, they become members of your party, and you can all hop into an expedition when everyone has readied up. As a note, <strong>if some players haven't progressed to your point in the game, they'll still be able to play, but could experience content they haven't seen yet</strong>.</p><p>To bypass the inviting and joining process, you can also set a multiplayer password. This allows you to matchmake with players using the same password as you, which gives you the chance to play with people that you're not friends with on your platform. You can choose to set the number of players with the password who can join, with a maximum of three players, which fills out the entire party. If you select one or two players, then the remaining spots will be filled with random players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402"></a><figcaption>Setting a multiplayer password for others to join off</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png"></figure><p>Finally, you can also set up to five group passwords. These passwords are so you can more easily see bloodstains, phantoms, and victor records from others who are using the same password. Of course, setting up five passwords takes some coordination if you're planning to use them across a large friend group, so make sure all of your friends are using the exact passwords.</p><h2 id="Does_Elden_Ring_Nightreign_support_cross_play_">Does Elden Ring Nightreign support cross-play?</h2><p>Now that you understand how multiplayer expeditions work, you might be wondering if you're able to party up with your friends or other players who are on a different system. Unfortunately, Elden Ring Nightreign does not support cross-play at launch, meaning that you can only matchmake with players who are on the same system as you.</p><p>However, there is one caveat to that rule. Nightreign does support cross-generation play, which means you can party up with friends and players who are using the same console brand as you. For example, if you're on Xbox Series X|S, a friend on Xbox One can still matchmake with you for an expedition. The same goes for players on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>So, while the game doesn't offer full cross-play, there is a silver lining for those who have a friend group with some mismatched last-generation and current-generation consoles.</p><p>And that just about does it for all of the ways to set up an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

The actual timing seems random, but if you keep completing expeditions--solo or in multiplayer, ending in success or failure--she'll eventually turn up in Roundtable Hold. Check the map after each expedition. When you see an exclamation mark outside the main hall, that'll be the Revenant.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you speak to the Revenant in the hold, change your active character to someone who isn't the Recluse. Speak with her when you're ready, and you'll end up in a spectral realm amidst some ruins. The Revenant is there with all her summons, and she challenges you to a fight. You only need to defeat her, though given the intensity of the attacks from her swordswoman and Pumpkin Head summons, you'll likely have to deal with at least one of them before you can safely attack the Revenant. Meanwhile, she'll be hurling Discus of Light spells at you, and her Giant Skeleton summon casts its beam of ghostflame.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502154" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502154"></a><figcaption>Take out the Pumpkin Head and swordfighter before targeting the Revenant.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Playing as the Raider or Executor is the easiest way to handle these obstacles, since both have high damage output and powerful ultimate arts.

She starts with a set of claws that has a higher-than-average chance of landing critical hits, but they're a close-range weapon. The Revenant also has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">healing</a> Incantation--though no built-in way to recover FP, so use it sparingly.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Necromancy"><strong>Necromancy</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">The spirits of non-boss enemies that the Revenant defeats join her in combat</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Summon_Spirit"><strong>Summon Spirit</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><p>The Revenant can summon one of three spirits at any time and dismiss them to summon another.

Unlike Helen and Frederick, Sebastian moves around very little, which means he's an easy target for fast-moving, hard-hitting enemies. He also struggles to keep up with bosses who move, so you have to re-summon him just to get him in attack range.</p><p dir="ltr">Frederick is the perfect middle ground when dealing with bosses, as he's mobile like Helen and has high damage output. Helen is decent at keeping bosses distracted, though she typically never lasts long enough to make a difference against more challenging enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons__magic__and_Incantations_for_Revenant">Best weapons, magic, and Incantations for Revenant</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502162"></a><figcaption>You won't always find magic drops this good, but even just one decent spell helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Revenant scales well with faith, and arcane and intelligence--aka sorcery--are close seconds. Everything else is a bit of a bust, which puts her in an odd situation. The Revenant can get by fine with a strength- or dexterity-based weapon, but the results are less positive than if she's playing to her strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">Nightreign has a handful of faith-scaling weapons, from the Erdtree Dagger to the excellent Sword of Night and Flame, and while the diminutive Revenant might not seem like a great choice for heavy weapons such as an axe or greatsword, her health scales high enough that you can risk using slower attacks without much harm. In an ideal situation, you'd give her something like Maliketh's Black Blade or the Grafted Dragon Head if you had very lucky item drops, though she's excellent with the Magma Whip Candlestick, Halo Scythe, and Winged Scythe as well.</p><p dir="ltr">If all else fails, just give her whatever <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">Incantations</a> and sorceries you can find and a weapon that causes blood loss. Rivers of Blood also works for her, thanks to its high arcane scaling.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Incantations, really, just use what you can get from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">magic and Incantation drop locations</a>. The Revenant has no specific requirements like the Recluse does, so whether you've stacked three variations of lightning spear or have a mix of dragon breath and fire spells, it doesn't really matter. Just make sure not to rely <em>only</em> on Incantations, since the Revenant has no built-in method of recovering FP. You'll have to use Starlit Shards or random passive buffs to restore her FP.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_relics_for_Revenant">Best relics for Revenant</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502163" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502163"></a><figcaption>The Revenant's two guaranteed Gems are among her best choices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Since the Revenant is built around Faith, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">best relics</a> for her help improve that stat.
