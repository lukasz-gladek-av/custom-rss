                <p dir="ltr">It's not every day that a billionaire gets a new superyacht and the chance to unveil a new video game console. But Valve co-founder Gabe Newell experienced just that last week. On November 12, Newell received his new luxury boat--a diesel-electric yacht that's over 360 feet long--<a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" rel="nofollow ">from Oceanco</a>. It's named Leviathan and was delivered the same day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">the Steam Machine was revealed</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Leviathan has a hospital, science lab, dive center, hot tub, basketball court, and 15 "gaming stations." That's not all for video games, either, as there are two racing simulators to take for a spin on the superyacht. It's unknown if a Steam Machine is on board--or even some form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-actor-stirs-up-half-life-3-rumors-with-cryptic-new-years-message/1100-6528613/">Half-Life 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yachts have great potential to serve as platforms for scientific research," said Newell. "It's about recognizing that you're part of a broader community and ensuring the yacht's presence adds value to the communities around it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4603719-leviathan-delivery-12-1800x1348.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4603719" data-ratio="0.74888888888889" data-width="1800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4603719-leviathan-delivery-12-1800x1348.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4603719"></a><figcaption>Valve cofounder took delivery of this superyacht named Leviathan last week.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/">Newell discussed his daily routine</a>, which included up to two daily sessions of scuba diving. Forbes estimates that he's worth up to $11 billion, and the Leviathan <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" rel="nofollow ">isn't his only yacht</a>. In August, <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Newell actually bought Oceanco</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-explains-the-secret-to-his-success/1100-6533485/">asked about all of his success</a>, Newell has pointed to luck and "being surrounded by really great people." Last week, Valve announced more than just the Steam Machine. The company also pulled back the curtain on the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame, a VR headset. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">unknown how much the Steam Machine will cost</a> when it arrives early next year.</p>

                <p>The new line of Rog Ally devices made by Asus in partnership with Microsoft and Xbox have exceeded expectations, and Asus is now undertaking efforts to ramp up production to meet demand.</p><p>Asus management said during the company's latest earnings briefing that the new Xbox-branded devices have seen an "extremely positive" response from the market, "exceeding expectations."</p><p>Some balked at the $600 and $1,000 price-points for the Rog Xbox Ally and Rog Xbox Ally X devices, but Asus said the market has spoken and there is demand for "premium, higher-end models" of the Rog Ally.</p><p>"These high-ended variants are currently in short supply. We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that exists.

Reviewer Tamoor Hussain wrote, "Where the Steam Deck feels like it can be a dedicated, primary, and only gaming platform that you'll have a seamless and slick experience akin to a console, the Xbox Ally very much feels like it functions best as an extension of PC ecosystems, whether that's Steam, Xbox, or any other."</p>

                <p>Bungie has fully settled the copyright lawsuit over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Red War campaign, closing a dispute that lasted more than a year. According to an entry cited by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">The Game Post</a>, a settlement conference held on November 12 was successful. As the filing states, "Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims," and the court thanked both sides for reaching "an amicable resolution."</p><p>The case began in October 2024, when sci-fi writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau claimed the studio copied "major parts" of his 2013–2014 stories posted on his Wordpress site. He argued that elements such as the Red Legion faction, the Red War storyline, and several plot details were "taken directly" from his original work.</p><p>After Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lawsuit-continues-as-judge-rejects-bungies-use-of-youtube-videos-and-wikis/1100-6531315/" data-ref-id="1100-6531315">failed to get the case dismissed</a>, both sides entered a long discovery process. Bungie repeatedly called the accusations "baseless," but because the original campaign is no longer in the game, the company had to rely on community videos and wiki entries instead of submitting the game itself as evidence. However, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lawsuit-continues-as-judge-rejects-bungies-use-of-youtube-videos-and-wikis/1100-6531315/" data-ref-id="1100-6531315">those are third-party sources</a>, the judge dismissed them.</p><p>As the case progressed, Martineau expanded his claims. He added the Curse of Osiris expansion, saying its story also overlapped with his writing. Later, his legal team attempted to include the Destiny Grimoire Anthology books, arguing that they had only recently discovered them and believed they contained "even more story beats" similar to his own work.</p><p>As the case will not go to trial, the judge also included a 60-day window to reopen the case if the agreement falls apart.</p><p>Last week, Bungie revealed the new roadmap for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-expansion-is-star-wars-inspired-and-gives-you-a-lightsaber/1100-6531341/" data-ref-id="1100-6531341">Renegades expansion</a>, which featured many changes based on player feedback from Edge of Fate, and admitted its original plan had been the wrong path for Destiny.</p><p>"We wanted to provide a preview of the changes coming to Destiny 2 with Renegades and update 9.5.0.1 that goes live the week after launch," the statement read in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/d2renegades_contentcalendar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. "The team has been focused on continuing to make improvements to power and progression, quality-of-life updates, and the start of a new weekly ritual alongside brand-new activities and systems with Renegades."</p>

                <p>Concord barely lasted two weeks before Sony pulled the plug on it, and it seems determined to keep the game offline as it just issued DMCA notices against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-lives-again-as-fan-made-project-unveils-gameplay-test-videos/1100-6536235/">fan-made effort to revive the live-service shooter as Concord Delta</a>. Recently, several Concord fans had managed to resurrect the game with some technical wizardry, and although the project was in a buggy WIP state, it was still a playable build on a custom server.</p><p>The team of developers responsible for reviving Concord did take measures to protect themselves and kept the player circle small, but copyright infringement claims against videos filed by Marscan--a company that monitors online content for large clients such as Sony and has issued DMCA notices to multiple creators in the past for content like the Bloodborne demake--has the group fearing that legal repercussions might be on the way.</p><p>"Due to worrying legal action we've decided to pause invites for the time being," one of the devs behind the project said in the team's Discord group (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" rel="nofollow ">The Games Post</a>). So far, the custom server for Concord Delta has not yet been targeted by Sony--only footage of it in action on YouTube or other social media platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/">Concord had a disastrous launch in 2024</a>, leading to the closure of its developer Firewalk Studios.

                <p>The Entertainment Software Association has released the results of its annual holiday shopping survey, and the data shows that kids really want video games, but not as much as they want cash.</p><p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The ESA's survey found</a> that video games are among the top three things that kids want this holiday, with 58% of kids saying they would like games as gifts this year. Money and gift cards (69%) was the most sought-after gift for kids, followed by clothes/accessories (63%), and then video games at 58%.</p><p>The survey also found that 58% of kids want to play more video games with their parents; the percentage increases to 73% for kids ages 5-7, 66% for ages 8-9, and 62% for ages 10-12.</p><p>The ESA's survey also found that the most likely generation to ask for video games as gifts this holiday was Gen Alpha (ages 5-12), at 62%. Beyond games themselves, kids also want in-game currency (43%), some kind of gaming console (39%), physical games (37%), video game accessories (37%), or a video game subscription (32%).</p><p>Finally, the ESA survey found that, among parents who said they are planning to buy their children video games as gifts this year, they plan to spend an average of $736.83. That figure may look high, but games are generally more and more expensive these days, and consoles are ticking up in price, too, due in part to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>"Our research this year shows that kids not only want games, they also want quality time with their families. In a world where people feel increasingly disconnected, playing video games remains one of the easiest--and most fun--ways to stay close to the people we love," ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis said in a statement.</p><p>This survey was conducted by YouGov and the ESA via a five-minute online survey from September 26-30 this year. More than 1,900 people aged 5-65 took part in the study, the data for which was "weighted to be representative of the overall US population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, education and census region."</p>

                <p>Valve is making a play for living rooms again with its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">Steam Machine hardware</a>, and the company believes that the compact gaming PC could be equal to or better than what "70%" of people have at home currently. In a new interview, Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat explained that the Steam Machine is designed to be both a powerful and entry-level gaming device, capable of running most of the games in your Steam library at high performance levels.</p><p>"As you know, we definitely learned a lot, from 10 years ago. We learned a lot from the Steam Deck. We really feel like we have all the hardware and the software bits to make that vision a reality," Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://youtu.be/VkW3wTHT-p8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tested</a>. "It needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games; we wanted it to be a pretty simple experience. We also wanted to target more of an entry-level device. Affordability is really important, and definitely the price-point played a huge factor in what performance level we're trying to target. Another thing we looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. It gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkW3wTHT-p8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aldehayyat's comments might not be too far off the mark. Older gaming PCs are still capable of running a wide variety of games thanks to upscaling technologies, while in the console space, many games are still released for both current and last-gen machines, like the PS4 and the Switch. Valve has also said that the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and the official tech specs released for it do suggest that it'll be capable of comfortably playing modern PC games.</p><p>The biggest question so far about the Steam Deck isn't <em>how </em>it'll perform, but what it'll cost when it launches next year. Aldehayyat has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">Valve wants to sell Steam Machine units at a "competitive" price</a>, with analysts predicting that it could cost $400 in a best-case scenario or as much as $1,000 if Valve is aiming to break even on every sale or make a slim profit. This is the second time that Valve is launching a Steam Machine, but Valve says it's determined to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/">not repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>
