                <p>Fallout creator Tim Cain has returned to Obsidian, but what is he working on? He's not allowed to say, and says you shouldn't even try to guess. Cain also shared an update about his personal life and a new friendship with a squirrel.</p><p>In a YouTube video, Cain said he recently relocated from Seattle to southern California, and one of the first things that happened was a squirrel ran up to him with no fear. "She just sat there and looked at me, and I shrugged and I'm like, 'What do you want from me? I don't know you.'" Cain fed the critter some walnuts and continues to feed the creature every day when he leaves and comes back home.</p><p>This is how Cain started the video, before getting into his return to Obsidian. He said he's now back at the studio, in-person and full-time. While he has returned to Obsidian, you'll also see his name appear in the credits of an upcoming unspecified game that he did contract work for before coming back to Obsidian, he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kCVWRZqyroA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Cain also mentioned that he did contract work for multiple other games, but they are unlikely to be released. He said the years 2020-2025 were a "weird time in the industry" when lots of games began production and then got canceled, for a variety of reasons. "I really don't know the status of all the games I contracted on," he said.</p><p>As for his current project at Obsidian, Cain said he cannot talk about because "that's covered under NDA." He added, "Don't bother guessing--you're not going to guess right."</p><p>Cain was one of the core designers of the 1997 original Fallout at Interplay Productions. He also worked on the sequel, along with games like South Park: The Stick of Truth and Pillars of Eternity. He was the game director on The Outer Worlds and a creative consultant for The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p>Obsidian has had a busy 2025, releasing Avowed in February 2025, Grounded 2 in July, and The Outer Worlds 2 in October. The studio has no confirmed and announced upcoming games, but we do know that Cain is working on whatever Obsidian may be cooking up next.</p><p>Cain said he's coming out of "semi-retirement" to return to Obsidian. Before this, he was doing the previously mentioned contract work, and making videos for his "Cain on Games" YouTube channel. This channel will continue going forward, he said, adding that no one at Obsidian told him to stop.</p>

                <p>Path of Exile 2 is playable now in early access, but the game's 1.0 release isn't ready yet--and it won't be here soon, it seems. Grinding Gear game director Jonathan Rogers said in an interview that the Tencent-owned studio will likely not hit the previously hinted March 2026 window.</p><p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "But as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p><p>There is no "specific timeline" for when Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release will arrive, but Rogers said he "certainly" hopes it won't be any later than the end of 2026.</p><p>"Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nH1hHyzUSk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7nH1hHyzUSk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other news, Grinding Gear has announced a new update for Path of Exile 2, The Last of the Druids, which is coming on December 12. This update allows players to become a wolf, bear, or wyvern, while the update also includes a balance overhaul, in-game performance optimization, and an expanded passive tree with more than 250 skills.</p><p>Finally, Grinding Gear announced a free weekend for Path of Exile 2, coming up December 12-15.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 was released in early access back in December 2024. You can buy the game now for $30, while it will transition to free-to-play for its 1.0 launch, whenever that comes. The game is available across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
