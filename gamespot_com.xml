                <p>The intrepid climbers of Peak are enjoying the game, but today they hit a wall--an invisible one. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">latest update</a>, which adds a new Mesa biome to the game, had a show-stopping bug (not the ticks, though). Players were finding their progress halted by invisible walls as they climbed the new clime. The good news: it's fixed!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players began to report the invisible wall issue almost immediately, and the game's Discord was filled with complaints about the bug. Now, though, developer Team PEAK and publisher AggroCrab have released a new update to fix the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're working on a fix for the invisible walls in the mesa‚ÄºÔ∏è Keep an eye out for a patch soon üíÄüôè Thanks for the patience yall <a href="https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM</a></p>  ‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Less than an hour after they acknowledged the issue, though, an end to our long nightmare was in sight.</p><p>Peak hit Steam in July to critical and fan acclaim, marrying the silly goofs of games like R.E.P.O. with some seriously fun cooperative climbing. This new update adds the "Mesa" biome to the game, which temporarily replaces the Alpine biome, and will eventually go into rotation alongside it. Where the Alpine level was a chilly place with freezing winds and icy rocks, the Mesa is a sun-baked little world where sunscreen and umbrellas aren't just a suggestion but a requirement to survive. This new biome has it all: cactuses, tumbleweeds, a deadly sun, and tornadoes that will send you flying.</p><p>This new update has more people playing today than any time since Peak launched (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), so this quick fix will be appreciated by many fans and newcomers.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> features dozens of different celebrations that your players can perform after making a big play on the field. From scoring a touchdown to recording an interception to just making a first down, you'll be able to celebrate quite often during a game. However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>

                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>
