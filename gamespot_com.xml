                <p>The newest patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now, and some believe it could be the game's final update. The newest patch is mainly focused on bug fixes.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes?utm_campaign=datv_pub_ww_ic_soco_blog_patch5&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=83168&amp;ts=1737730572767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update</a> fixes an issue where Rook was limited to only being able to flirt with Lucanis in a specific conversation. It also addresses a "blocking" issue with a puzzle in the Converged City, as well as a particularly horrible-sounding bug that caused Rook to get caught in a drowning loop when allies should be rescuing them. There is one quality-of-life change in the update as well, and this adds recommended levels to side quests.</p><p>BioWare has signaled that this may be the final significant update for The Veilguard, saying it is happy with the game's stability levels now and is shifting its focus to look for game-breaking bugs if they should appear. BioWare concluded its note by saying "Dareth shiral!" This <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_language" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">translates to</a> "farewell," and many are taking this to mean BioWare is moving on from The Veilguard.</p><p>This wouldn't be a surprise, of course, as BioWare itself confirmed in November 2024 that The Veilguard would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">receive no expansions and developers would shift to other projects</a>, including the next Mass Effect. GameSpot has contacted EA/BioWare in an attempt to get more details on what's next.</p><p>In other news, BioWare owner Electronic Arts recently announced that The Veilguard failed to reach the company's expectations for number of players. The game "engaged" 1.5 million players during the company's latest quarter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">down nearly 50% from the company's expectations.</a></p><h2><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard January 23 patch notes</strong></h2><p><b>Quality of Life Changes:</b></p><ul><li>Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels.</li></ul><p><b>Bug Fixes: </b></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Rook could only flirt with Lucanis in a specific conversation.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the Regrets of The Dread Wolf quest not triggering properly or stopping Rook with an invisible wall in the Crossroads.</li><li>Fixed a blocking issue with a puzzle in the Converged City area of the Crossroads.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the “Imperium’s Resolve” armor causing negative damage instead of the intended zero fire, cold, necrotic, and electric damage.</li><li>Fixed excessive clipping on Taash’s “Rivain’s Legacy” armor.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented some Rooks from changing the runes on their lyrium dagger.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the Medium Armor Mastery skill for Warriors.</li><li>Fixed a spot on Rivain’s beach where Rook could get stuck in a cycle of drowning, never to be pulled out of the water by their companions.</li><li>Fixed a typo on a note Rook can find in Dock Town.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused photo mode screenshots to be noticeably worse quality when HDR was turned to “On.”</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the photo mode screenshot location to still be shown on screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the fireflies in the opening area of the Crossroads to flicker at an alarming rate on specific settings.</li><li>Fixed a lighting issue in one of the conversations with the whole team in the Lighthouse.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the Mirror of Transformation that blocked players from zooming in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Objective Marker Visibility was not updated when the exploration preset was changed with the other options in the Exploration sub-category.</li><li>Some adjustments to the game credits.</li></ul>

"As creators, we will continue to convey (the relationships between our characters, etc.) through our content," Hamaguchi told Automaton.

Fans apparently took this to mean the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director was officially chiming in on a longstanding discussion about the game's love triangle between Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa. But now Hamaguchi is saying that isn't the case at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Again, I would like to convey to the fans that the characters’ relationships are portrayed through content," Hamaguchi told Automaton. In other words, it's up to players to decide who to ship with Cloud. Though keep in mind the story hasn't been completed yet, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/">the final part of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy taking a big step forward</a> recently.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth just launched on PC after previously only being available on PS5 since February 2024.

                <p dir="ltr">Over four years after its undeniably rocky launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s recent Steam reviews have reached the coveted "overwhelmingly positive" rating.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">Steam's user-review data</a>, 95% of the 12,818 reviews written by users over the past 30 days were positive. (Cyberpunk 2077's overall score--the average of all 716,126 of its reviews--is still sitting at "very positive.")</p><p dir="ltr">When Cyberpunk 2077 launched back in 2020, it was in pretty rough shape. So rough, in fact, that it led to developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-rough-launch-led-to-a-massive-structural-overhaul-at-cd-projekt-red/1100-6519510/">CD Projekt Red's near-total restructuring</a>. But the studio was quick to learn from its mistakes, and spent years working to fix the game's broken bits, and improve on its strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result of this effort was the 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty DLC, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/">completely restructured gameplay</a> and added a compelling new storyline featuring voice work from Idris Elba. Phantom Liberty was well-received by critics and players alike (GameSpot gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">a rare 10/10</a>), and after years spent working to create--and then fix--the game, CD Projekt Red seemed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-deems-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-a-commercial-success" rel="nofollow ">pleased with the result</a> as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Phantom Liberty released just over a year ago, in September 2023. Given the positive player reception, it's not too surprising that the game's user reviews on Steam have become increasingly positive as well.</p><p dir="ltr">So what's next for the Cyberpunk 2077 franchise? Well, the game's core development team has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-core-team-moving-to-boston-to-start-work-on-sequel/1100-6508035/">moved to Boston to begin work</a> on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-be-more-authentically-america-dev-says/1100-6524584/">"more authentically American" sequel</a>.

                <p>A new report suggests NHL players are increasingly turning to video games and weed edibles during their downtime, as opposed to boozing like players of past generations took part in regularly.</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078563/2025/01/24/nhl-weed-gummies-video-gaming-alcohol/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that because technology has advanced so much, it's very easy to "live a virtual life instead of a real one." Buffalo Sabres forward Peyton Krebs, 23, said, "We'll all go out for dinner, but then guys will generally go back to their rooms to play video games."</p><p>One anonymous defenseman told the site that playing video games with teammates can help with camaraderie. "You just have to be more open," this person said. "I'll try to drag guys out of their comfort zone, and then I'll play video games with them."</p><p>Beyond video games, NHL players appear to be increasingly turning to weed edibles over booze during downtime. The Athletic spoke with more than three-dozen current NHL players and asked if they took an edible during the season, and 38% "indicated" they did. Hockey players are known to be big boozers, but this trend may be on the decline. Floridan Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told the site he was told when he entered the NHL a decade ago, "If you can't play hungover in this league, you don't belong in it."</p><p>That attitude may be changing, especially with younger players. Schmidt said it's unacceptable for players to show up to practice at anything less than 100%. Alcohol-fueled partying during the season is on the decline, it seems, as players look to mellow out instead and take better care of their bodies.</p><p>A veteran NHL forward who asked to remain anonymous said he's sad about the lack of boozing as a means of team-bonding. "When I came into the league, we were going out for beers the night before games," he said. "I think (the NHL) used to be more fun back in the day."</p><p>Cannabis is not banned for NHL players, and it is legal in many cities across North America where NHL teams play.</p><p>As for EA's NHL video game series, the newest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-640627">NHL 25</a>, was just recently updated with a new 4 Nations Face-Off update themed around the real-world tournament.</p>
