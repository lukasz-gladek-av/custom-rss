                <p>On the opening night of Gamescom last month, Capcom and Square Enix revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> collaboration that will touch the worlds of both games. Now, Capcom has revealed that its side of the crossover is starting Monday, September 29 with the arrival of its Free Title Update 3. That news came with a fresh trailer that shows off what happens when the worlds of Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14 collide.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1iBhq-C90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ca1iBhq-C90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, FF14's Omega Planetes has found a way into the Monster Hunter world, and it's going to take some teamwork to defeat this mechanical monstrosity. To combat Omega Planetes, two new FF14 jobs are being introduced in Wilds: Dark Knight and Pictomancer. The former gives players Dark Knight-themed armor that can create damage-absorbing barriers and push back against heavy attacks. Pictomancers essentially create images that unleash powerful spells against their enemies.</p><p>Several Final Fantasy 14-inspired cosmetics will be unlockable in this update, including a Chocobo seikret skin and new gestures. The trailer also teases December's Free Title Update 4, which will feature the return of Gogmazios, an elder dragon who hasn't been huntable in the game since Monster Hunters 4 Ultimate in 2015. </p><p>Although Capcom recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, the PC port's optimization issues won't be directly addressed by Free Title Update 3. Capcom has previously stated that those issues will be the focus of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>, which doesn't currently have a date tied to it.</p>
