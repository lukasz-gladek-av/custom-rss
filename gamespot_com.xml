Studio Wildcard may be getting closer to revealing more information, as the team announced the first original expansion for Ark: Survival Ascended, Lost Colony, that will directly link the Ark story to the upcoming sequel this November.</p><p dir="ltr">Lost Colony will see players assume the role of heroine Mei Yin--voiced by Everything Everywhere All At Once's Michelle Yeoh--as she searches a new world for hidden secrets. The expansion will add new abilities, gear, builds, beasts to tame, and more to the game, while those who preorder the expansion will receive "exclusive gameplay preview content" immediately after placing the order.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XM4hkeEAfA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3XM4hkeEAfA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The expansion will include multiple anime story sequences created by Studio MAPPA, which is known for multiple hit series including Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Chainsaw Man.
