                <p>After seven years between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner. In the run up to the game's release, Gearbox President Randy Pitchford has said some off-the-wall things. But his latest remarks about potentially reselling a Borderlands-inspired Fortnite skin sounds like a surefire way to get banned by Epic Games.</p><p>On <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, Pitchford recalled that the Psycho Bandit skin became an in-demand item on Fortnite, and suggested that flipping the Mad Moxxi skin on eBay may also prove to be lucrative.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Is it true that the pre-order incentive Psycho Bandit skin in became one of the most valuable skins in Fortnite sometimes fetching over $2k when trading on eBay? What are the odds this bundle becomes worth much more than the price of the game it is promoting? <a href="https://t.co/wQnLrXngfr" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/wQnLrXngfr</a></p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It's true that the Psycho Bandit Fortnite skin was very popular in 2019, in part because it was only briefly available as a promotion for Borderlands 3. After appearing in the Epic Games Store for a limited time, Psycho Bandit wasn't officially available for purchase in Fortnite until it returned in April 2025.</p><p>Mad Moxxi's Fortnite skin will be available to players who preorder Borderlands 4 on Epic Games Store, and as a standalone purchase for a limited time starting on September 29. However, that skin is unlikely to be as virtually scarce as Psycho Bandit. And since reselling skins on eBay or other third-party outlets is against Epic's terms of service, it's just not a viable strategy.</p><p>Earlier this year, Pitchford said that fans would "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">find a way to make it happen</a>" if Borderlands 4 was $80. Those remarks weren't well-received, although Pitchford also stated that the development budget for Borderlands 4 was "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">more than twice</a>" what Gearbox had to work with for Borderlands 3.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will officially launch on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Switch 2 owners will have to wait until October 3 for the game to arrive.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>No matter how much you might want a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sly-cooper-and-the-thievius-raccoonus/">Sly Cooper</a> game, it doesn't really sound like anyone at the original studio that made it, Sucker Punch Productions, is all that interested. Currently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/infamous/" data-ref-id="5000-32202">Infamous</a> developer is preparing for the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, which is due out at the start of next month on October 2. That game's co-creative director Nate Fox recently made an appearance on Minnmax where he was asked 125 rapid-fire questions. On the topic of Sly Cooper, Fox's response makes it pretty clear that right now, there are very few people at Sucker Punch who would want to make it.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about what percentage of the studio Fox estimated would be excited if he said the next game after Ghost of Yotei would be a new Sly Cooper, he had this to say: "10%." After such a low figure was offered, interviewer Ben Hanson expressed his surprise, to which Fox responded, "It's been a long time, Ben, since Sly Cooper's come out."<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sucker-punch-has-no-plans-to-revisit-sly-cooper-or-infamous-series/1100-6505057/?TheTime=2022-07-01T20%3A37%3A08&amp;PostType=image&amp;UniqueID=9365DB52-F97D-11EC-9B09-5A5C16F31EAE&amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;ftag=ftag%3DGSS-05-10aab8e/" data-ref-id="1100-6505057">Back in 2022</a>, a blog post from Sucker Punch even outright said there aren't any Sly Cooper games in the works.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="460">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ffOTS1CkZVg?start=460" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Fox himself served as a designer on the original game--which came out way back in 2002--reprising this role for the following two games as well. But following the third game's release in 2005, there's only been 2013's Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time, which was made by Sanzaru Games, not Sucker Punch. So it's been two full decades since Sucker Punch made a Sly Cooper game, having released three full games in the Infamous series, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and Yotei in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">In recent years Sly Cooper has mostly been relegated to cameo fodder, having been referenced in both Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Astro Bot. For now, perhaps all you can hope for is a modern-day port of the original trilogy at the very least.</p>

                <p>A new update for Black Myth: Wukong is out now and it addresses a key complaint about the recently launched Xbox version. The new update that arrived on September 10 improves the graphics on Xbox Series X, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-has-big-downgrade-in-performance-mode-on-xbox/1100-6534395/" data-ref-id="1100-6534395">people and graphics experts said the Series X version didn't deliver the best visuals.</a></p><p>This new patch fixes an issue "where graphics appeared blurry on Xbox Series X," developer Game Science said. The studio said global illumination ghosting for the game's Quality and Balance modes was to blame.</p><p>A report from Digital Foundry said the Series S version of Black Myth: Wukong had even bigger struggles, but this newest patch for the game does not mention the Series S. It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> were behind the delay of the game's port, which publisher Game Science denied. The Game Science team has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing the game to the Xbox consoles was unexpectedly difficult</a>.</p><p>Beyond that fix, the September 10 update for Black Myth: Wukong fixes various crashes and errors, along with bugs that could make some quests impossible to pass. The update also fixes an issue where some bosses in Mount Huaguo would "sink abnormally" in some specific conditions. You can see the complete patch notes below, as <a href="https://gamesci.cn/wukong/news/detail?id=220" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared by Game Science on its website.</a></p><p>Black Myth: Wukong came to Xbox on August 20, 2025, which was exactly one year after the game debuted on PS5 and PC. This timing fueled ongoing rumors that Game Science and Sony had some kind of timed-exclusive deal.</p><p>Following the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-myth-game-zhong-kui-announced-with-teaser-trailer/1100-6534105/" data-ref-id="1100-6534105">making a sequel, Zhong Kui</a>, but it's still very early days for the game.</p><h2>Black Myth: Wukong September 10 patch notes:</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the graphics appeared blurry on Xbox Series X due to global illumination ghosting in Quality and Balance modes.</li><li>Fixed crashes and errors occurring under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain side quests became unprogressable or triggered errors when a dialogue was exited abnormally.</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain bosses in Mount Huaguo would sink abnormally when the player moved away.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game responded slowly to controller input in the Text Language dropdown menu within Settings.</li></ul>

It's the same Sapporo beer, but in specially designed packaging to promote the game. And to that end, the packages come with a QR code that players can activate to unlock an in-game reward when Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for PS5.</p><p>The in-game reward is "The Charm of Hokkyokusei," which features Sapporo's famous star logo. Hokkyokusei is the Japanese term for the North Star, and this connects back to Sapporo lore, as <a href="https://www.sapporobeer.com/our-history" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's original brewmaster</a> was said to have followed the North Star to Germany where he learned how to make beer. In the game, using the charm gives players a "minor chance" to "not consume ranged weapon ammo when equipped," according to the <a href="https://mybeerbuzz.com/sapporo-and-ghost-of-yotei-limited-time-package-now-available/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement.</a></p><p>"Sapporo's original brewmaster and the hero in Ghost of Yotei both experience defiance, discovery, and artistry to re-write their fates. These are inspirational stories that connect us to Japan and its remarkable history. We aim to share those stories and bring fans closer to Japan through this partnership," Sapporo boss Zach Keeling said.</p><p>Sucker Punch boss Brian Fleming said when the team visited Japan for scouting trips, the developers knocked back "a few refreshing pints of Sapporo."</p><p>Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garfep.bsky.social/post/3lyiwd66cck2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a social media post</a>, "We made one joke about a 'Yotei Six Pack' and a year later we have the perfect partnership.

                <p>Canadian musician bbno$ is everywhere right now. Pronounced 'baby no money,' and definitely not 'bibinos,' he's collaborated with everyone from the VTuber Ironmouse through to producer Y2K. Several of his tracks have gone viral on social media platforms such as TikTok, including the likes of "Edamame" which was used in the trailer for The Garfield Movie, and "U Mad?" which appeared in CS:GO promotional materials.
