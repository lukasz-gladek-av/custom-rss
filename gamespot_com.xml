                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards</a>, developer Milestone showed off its new project, a resurrection of the classic arcade racer Screamer. While the trailer didn't show off any gameplay, it did tease a darker take on the series set in a neon-light city straight out of old-school anime. Milestone says that it's aiming to blend Screamer's classic arcade driving with a deep storyline featuring multiple character arcs, and the game is currently scheduled to be released in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Screamer draws inspiration from anime and manga from the '80s and '90s. Milestone says that the game's narrative and visual framework will be enhanced by animated cutscenes created in collaboration with Polygon Pictures, the Japanese animation studio behind series such as Tron: Uprising, Transformers Prime, and Pacific Rim: The Black.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ohDOlboyZg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8ohDOlboyZg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Milestone, the Last of Us voice actor Troy Baker is also involved, as he lends his voice to a 'pivotal" character in the game. The storyline will feature themes of human will, revenge, love, and greed with classic sci-fi influences.</p><p>The first Screamer game was released back in 1995, and at the time, it was notable for its arcade-style gameplay and demanding system requirements. Three sequels followed in its wake--Screamer 2, Screamer Rally, and Screamer 4x4--with the series being developed by Milestone. If you didn't have a PlayStation and Ridge Racer or a Sega Saturn with Daytona USA, this was the next best game to play on PC at the time.</p><p>For more, check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">all The Game Awards nominees and winners</a>.</p>

                <p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards,</a> Onimusha Way of the Sword is the first new entry in the series since 2006. Capcom revealed the game with a cinematic trailer and confirmed it's coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p><p>The trailer shows a bunch of red flames floating around in different feudal Japanese locations, before being absorbed by the protagonist. There are also a few moments of combat that appear to be in-game, showing off the third-person action against different supernatural monsters, like fungus-infected samurais and giant monsters. A few different big monsters are shown near the end of the trailer, including a large boar looking enemy walking around on two legs.</p><p>Onimusha is historically a hack-and-slash action series, using historical figures to retell parts of Japanese history, with a healthy dose of the supernatural injected, of course. Previous entries were set in the Sengoku period, but Capcom has revealed that Way of the Sword will be set in the early Edo period, taking place in Kyoto. The last mainline entry in the series was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, with only a mobile game and a remaster released since.</p><p>Check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards announcements</a> to see everything revealed during the award show.</p>
