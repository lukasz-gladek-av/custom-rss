                <p>The indie game Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 billed itself as a sequel to a fictitious franchise. Now Strange Scaffold has teamed up with newcomer Pedalboard Games to produce a sequel, kind of, which is positioned as a remastered version of the first game in the series, which never actually existed until now. It's coming in September.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830150/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_1_ReRaptored/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored</a>, you'll play as Jack Briar, an ATF agent dispatched to the Louisiana bayou to investigate strange dinosaur happenings. The game looks very similar to the original CRDM3 that released in April, albeit with new protagonist. The original game was a story-based match-3 metroidvania, which meant you would explore different story avenues and play match-3 battles to progress. This looks similar, as Jack Briar will earn new traits by exploring and use those to unlock paths. CRDM3 was also a cheeky commentary on game development itself, so we can probably expect that to continue.</p><p>Strange Scaffold produced the first game, but new studio Pedalboard Games is developing ReRaptored. This marks the beginning of Strange Scaffold's "Project Share" program, which allows new studios to access the original code and riff on their concepts. Strange Scaffold's Xalavier Nelson Jr. explained the philosophy behind the move on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lukkwvqj4k2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>.</p><p>"Video games is the only medium outside of music that can take the exact same component pieces and by modifying them and switching around their context, end up creating a new, valid, exciting artistic expression," he said. "And you can see this in the modding world, but not in traditional commercial video game development."</p><p>So Strange Scaffold sent the tools to Pedalboard Games under the care of original co-lead Colin McInerney, letting that team quickly iterate on the project and make a new game out of it.</p><p>"We don't intend to do a Project Share very often at Strange Scaffold, but we hope that by doing it at all and being so open about it that it empowers and encourages other developers to investigate ways to, in radical methods that aren't incentivized by capitalism, share resources with each other, and survive, and get games in players' hands more quickly, and at a higher quality than would otherwise be possible, in a way that's more sustainable, for all of our sakes."</p><p>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116510/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored is coming September 23.</p>

                <p>Ori developer Moon Studios says that it'll be prioritizing PS5--and potentially, Switch 2--over Xbox for the console port of its PC game No Rest for the Wicked, citing "current market conditions" as the reason why. While the studio isn't ruling out an Xbox Series X|S release entirely, CEO Thomas Mahler added that it just made sense to prioritize PS5 before considering other platforms.</p><p>"Given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially Switch 2 for the time being--we'll have to discuss things with Microsoft to see what makes sense for Xbox," Mahler explained on the No Rest for the Wicked Discord (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ori-studios-focus-on-ps5-over-xbox-for-next-game-isnt-a-shakedown-but-common-fcking-sense-says-ceo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>).</p>

<p>In a social media post, Mahler clarified his statement further, explaining that Moon Studios is looking to eventually "ship on all platforms," and on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, he mentioned that optimization for PS5 was easier in comparison to Xbox Series X|S. For a small developer like Moon Studios, this simply made more economic sense for the studio to focus on that platform, Mahler explained.</p><p>"We'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," Mahler wrote. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S, and that'll take more time to optimize compared to porting to PS5 and PS5 Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5 [and ] PS5 Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later. So there's nothing to see here; it's just common sense with us having to make the right moves given the resources we have while making sure we give players what they want as fast as possible."</p><p>Moon Studios wouldn't be the first developer to bring its game to PS5 first and Xbox Series X|S later, and data released last year suggested that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-has-outsold-xbox-series-x-s-2-to-1-newly-revealed-sales-data-suggests/1100-6520964/" data-ref-id="1100-6520964">PS5 may have outsold the Xbox Series X|S</a> by roughly a 2:1 margin. That divide may have increased further since then, as Sony recently confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-4-years-later-ps5-has-more-monthly-users-than-ps4/1100-6532430/" data-ref-id="1100-6532430">49 million monthly users on PS5</a> as of April 30, 2024.</p><p>Microsoft remains cagey with exact figures related to its Xbox Series X|S console, and over the last couple of months, it has adopted a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">this is an Xbox</a>" multiplatform strategy that has seen more of its formerly exclusive games released on PS5. It has also teamed up with Asus to make an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245"> Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC</a>.</p>

This limited-time event is only playable during certain times, but if you happen to catch it and play through a full set of rounds, you can earn some very valuable loot.</p><p>The Sieve is a three-person cooperative activity based in and around the Caldera, the main hub area on Kepler. It is only active for thirty minutes and then has a 1 hour and 44 minute cooldown, meaning that you'll need to be patient or lucky to hop in at the right time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920" data-ratio="0.56260575296108" data-width="2364" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920"></a><figcaption>When it goes live, you can boot into the activity from this icon on the Kepler map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg"></figure><p>If you do launch into it, you'll be matchmade with a Fireteam to take on a series of tasks oriented narratively around the Drifter's mining rig. You'll need to place beacons for Drifter to mine dark matter from around the Caldera, and your Fireteam will need to fend off waves of enemies, including difficult sabotage Minotaurs that can shut down the mining operation for an extended period of time.</p><p>If you successfully complete the mining activity, you are granted rewards and are given the opportunity to start another activity. These are usually oriented around bosses, but the type and strength of the boss varies randomly. After killing the boss, you'll get some more rewards and can start another mining rig defense run.</p><p>Fireteams can go through this back-and-forth cadence for several iterations. Occasionally, you'll get a special one-off event of banking motes (like Gambit) which appears to grant even more valuable rewards.
