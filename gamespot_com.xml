                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that hardcore mode will come to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 next week. The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>
