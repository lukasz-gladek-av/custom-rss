                <p>The PEGI board has announced that it has reversed its decision to classify Balatro with a PEGI 18 rating and will instead have a PEGI 12 rating. The game has a E10+ rating in North America, making its original PEGI 18 classification in Europe strange.</p><p>As revealed in an update on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a>, Balatro's European publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing, successfully appealed the PEGI 18 classification. While the board originally classified the game as PEGI 18 due to explaining various poker hands, the more fantastical elements mitigated the "gambling" aspects and brought the rating down to PEGI 12.</p><p>Another game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord/" data-ref-id="5000-520128">Luck Be A Landlord</a>, also got its PEGI 18 rating reduced to PEGI 12. In this game, players can attempt to pay their rent by using a customizable slot machine and has similar roguelike gameplay elements as Balatro. Since Luck Be A Landlord had no specific gambling skills that could be transferred to the real world, the game was able to achieve its new rating classification.</p><p>However, the board said that any teaching or glamorization of simulated gambling will still result in a PEGI 18 rating.</p><p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorization of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls," the board explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-dev-clowns-on-pegi-ratings-criteria-as-games-with-actual-gambling-are-sold-to-kids/1100-6528491/" data-ref-id="1100-6528491">Developer LocalThunk</a> said that they didn't have a problem with the rating itself for Balatro, but pointed out that games like EA Sports FC have microtransactions and loot boxes while being classified as PEGI 3+, meaning "suitable for all ages."</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ambitious-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-shows-off-20-minutes-of-quest-gameplay/1100-6525882/" data-ref-id="1100-6525882">Skyblivion</a>, the fan-made effort to put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">Skyrim</a>'s engine, is finally nearing completion. TESRenewal, the modding group working on the project, made the announcement in a new gameplay video showcasing some of Oblivion's upgraded cities, but the team said they still don't have an anticipated release date yet. It'll just be sometime in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Making games takes time, this goes double for a volunteer project the size of a AAA game that took a team of full-time devs years to make," the group said, echoing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">similar statement made in 2023</a>. "Regardless we would like to share today that Skyblivion is in a state where we can promise a 2025 release at the latest. We hope with your support to finish the final steps in completing our dream, maybe even beating our own estimation."</p><p dir="ltr">The group does not accept donations for their work and donated proceeds from their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlmcLd2meqw&amp;t=10s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 charity livestream</a> to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvlz8CYCQzc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dvlz8CYCQzc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This video, like TESRenewal's previous update six months ago, includes a lengthy quest walkthrough--The Fighter's Quest this time--that highlights just how much work the group has put into the project. In addition to improved lighting and assets at higher resolutions, TESRenewal added a new leveling system, changed boss encounters, altered enemy scaling, and even expanded locations. They've also made it possible for Oblivion's classes and spellcrafting to work in Skyrim's engine and have incorporated fan feedback throughout development.</p><p dir="ltr">Work on some of Oblivion's cities remains incomplete, but TESRenewal said that bug fixes and optimization are their main priorities in the coming months. When Skyblivion does launch, its updates will apply to the entirety of Oblivion, including all side quests and locations. Skyblivion itself will be free, though TESRenewal said you'll have to own Skyrim: Special Edition, Oblivion, and all of Oblivion's DLC for the Skyblivion installer to work. Oblivion and its DLC are available on Steam.</p>
