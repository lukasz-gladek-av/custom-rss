                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2's full unveiling on April 2 has confirmed one of its most exciting new features: mouse functionality. You can indeed use the console's new Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse, opening up possibilities for point-and-click adventures and strategy games to be an even better experience on the system.</p><p>In an overview of the Switch 2 hardware, Nintendo confirmed that both the left and right Joy-Cons on the system, which are also bigger and more ergonomic than their predecessors, can be turned on their side and used like a computer mouse. The Direct didn't expand too much on the mouse functionality, other than noting that mouse controls will only be available in certain games.</p><p>Nintendo later demonstrated a wheelchair-sports-inspired game called Drag x Drive designed to make the most of the unique dual-mouse controls, but it will be interesting to see how many developers make use of the unique control scheme. From everything Nintendo has shown so far, the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode doesn't look as comfortable to use for long stretches of gaming as a conventional mouse, but it could have interesting uses in porting PC games to the Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo first teased Joy-Con mouse functionality for the Switch 2 in its announcement video for the console.

                <p>After being glimpsed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 reveal</a>, Nintendo formally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart 9</a> during this week's Switch 2 Direct livestream--the game is officially called Mario Kart World. This new look at the kart-racing game showed off several of the familiar faces who'll be hitting the track, including everyone's favorite plumber Mario, several members of the Mushroom Kingdom, and other racers like Donkey Kong.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo will share more details on Mario Kart World during a special Nintendo Direct on April 17.</p><p>Mario Kart World looks like a major step up from Mario Kart 8. It features support for up 24 racers, which is the most in franchise history. There are also appear to be new vehicles, including jet skis and jets, while players can now grind on rails and flip across walls. Mario Kart World also includes time-of-day and weather conditions that change throughout races. Players are free to drive off-road "virtually everywhere," Nintendo said during the presentation.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at Mario Kart World. Nintendo said it is releasing exclusively on Switch 2, so it seems it won't also be playable on the original Switch via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatibility. </a></p><p>The classic Grand Prix mode returns, along with what's called Knockout Tour. In this mode, players take part in races from one corner of the world to another with checkpoints--players are eliminated if they're last to reach certain checkpoints. There is also a Free Roam mode that allows players to basically go anywhere they want for a scenic drive and to take photos with friends on the road.</p><p>Mario Kart 9 has some big boots to fill, as it's a sequel to one of the best-selling Nintendo games of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. As of December 31, 2024, Mario Kart 8 has sold 67 million units on Switch and it has a significant lead on other top-selling games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons (47.44 million units sold), Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (35.88 million units sold), and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (32.62 million units sold).</p>

                <p>2024 was a brutal year for the video game industry, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">thousands of jobs lost due to massive layoffs</a>. So far, that trend has continued in 2025 with recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/" data-ref-id="1100-6530502">layoffs at Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">Striking Distance Studios</a>. Now, Shams Jorjani--the CEO of Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios--is speaking out about the mass layoffs and calling for accountability from the CEOs who make those decisions.</p><p>"I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost… 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," said Jorjani during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries? What's happening is that regular developers are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry."</p><p>Jorjani went on to explain that he isn't against seeing studios expand, but he argues that growth should be responsibly paced for the long-term health of the business and the employees who work there. He added that his "first priority is to make sure that people [at Arrowhead] have jobs for many years." During the same interview, Jorjani noted that the turnaround of Helldivers 2 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devsceo-was-inspired-by-no-mans-sky-turnaround/1100-6530533/" data-ref-id="1100-6530533">inspired by No Man's Sky's comeback story</a>.</p><p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-discusses-gaming-industrys-mass-layoffs-and-what-caused-them/1100-6530246/" data-ref-id="1100-6530246">recently made similar remarks</a> about layoffs and suggested that the video game industry would be in a more sustainable place if companies were making several different types of games rather than a constant cycle of new battle-royale titles.</p>
