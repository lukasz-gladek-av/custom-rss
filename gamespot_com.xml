                <p>With Fallout Day finally here and the internet buzzing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">talk of remakes, remasters</a>, and maybe even a brand-new entry in Bethesda's iconic post-apocalyptic series, one Hollywood star has jumped into the conversation. Actor Danny Trejo, the fan-favorite tough guy from From Dusk Till Dawn, Machete, and Spy Kids--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-this-fallout-4-danny-trejo-character/1100-6433701/" data-ref-id="1100-6433701">and huge Fallout fan</a>--made his opinion crystal clear <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on social media</a>: He wants Fallout: New Vegas back--and now.</p><p>Trejo, who actually voiced the ghoul mechanic Raul Alfonso Tejada in New Vegas, commented on Bethesda's official Instagram post with, "Remaster New Vegas boss!" followed by a fire emoji. That message sent shockwaves through the Wasteland, garnering almost 1,600 likes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trejo's wish wasn’t included in Bethesda’s official lineup for Fallout Day. During the celebration, the studio is set to show off more from Fallout 76's upcoming Burning Springs expansion out this December, and yes, that includes Walton Goggins returning as The Ghoul from the hit Fallout TV series. There are also updates coming to Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter, plus new content via Creations, Bethesda's name for officially supported community mods. Fans can also expect merch drops, live events, and a post-show dedicated to the ever-passionate Fallout community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664" data-ratio="0.64071856287425" data-width="1169" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Instagram/Lan Pitts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Fallout has had a pretty good year in reaching fans outside the games, partially thanks to the success of the Prime Video show. It even had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-teases-fallout-and-five-nights-at-freddys-halloween-horror-nights-houses/1100-6533789/" data-ref-id="1100-6533789">its own haunted house at this year's Halloween Horror Nights</a> at Universal Studios. Professional sports are getting in on the fun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pro-hockey-team-is-hosting-fallout-night-in-partnership-with-bethesda/1100-6535586/" data-ref-id="1100-6535586">themed jerseys for Fallout Night</a>.</p><p>Still, the rumor mill is spinning faster than a Gatling laser. With The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered now out and whispers of a Fallout 3 remaster having leaked back in 2023, fans are convinced that New Vegas might not be far behind. And while everyone's dreaming of a full Fallout 5 reveal, Bethesda has made it clear that it won't happen anytime soon, as the team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">focusing on The Elder Scrolls VI first</a>.</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard reminded fans earlier this year that the studio doesn't want to rush its next big project. "We totally get the desire for a new single-player game," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he told YouTuber MrMattyPlays last year</a>. "But these things take time--we just want to get it right."</p><p>The last mainline Fallout release was Fallout 4 back in 2015, followed by Fallout 76 in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">which found a new surge of popularity thanks to Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>. So while the vault door to Fallout 5 may stay sealed for a while longer, it's clear Bethesda wants every future entry to be a true nuclear event in gaming history.</p>

                <p>Amazon's popular TV series The Boys is going to become its own video game, series creator Eric Kripke has revealed. He said in an interview that "there are plans" for The Boys to spin into its own video game, but not on console. Kripke would like to see a console game someday, though.</p><p>"There is currently a desire, but no hard plans for, a console game. I don't want to give anything away, because I'm not sure what I’m allowed to say or not, but there are plans for some other kinds of video games that aren't necessarily Xbox or PlayStation," he said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-boys-gen-v-finale-video-game-mexico-spinoff-1236558790/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety.</a></p><p>Characters from The Boys have appeared in games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat, but there hasn't been a dedicated game for the series as of yet.</p><p>Based on the comics, The Boys is a TV series for Prime Video that spawned a spin-off series, Gen V, and a spin-off called The Boys: Mexico is also in the works. There is also the upcoming prequel series, Vought Rising, which takes place in the 1950s.</p><p>The series seems ripe for a video game, as the world is full of powerful characters with unique abilities, and the off-beat and comedic tone might be appealing to many.</p><p>Amazon--which hosts The Boys TV show--is also a big player in the world of video games, but it remains to be seen what company may back any future games based on the show. The show is produced in part by Sony.</p><p>Gen V recently wrapped up its second season, which leads into the fifth and final season of The Boys. A release date has not been announced, but it's expected in 2026.</p>
