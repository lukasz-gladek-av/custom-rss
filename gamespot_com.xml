<p dir="ltr">There are also a number of new display options. A "Very Low" option for the game's various display settings have been added to help "improve performance" on some devices, and Bethesda has additionally added support for 32:9 and 32:10 resolutions, as well as more 16:9, 16:10, and 21: 9 resolution options.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the update, it's largely small quality-of-life tweaks or bug fixes. A new marker on the player's compass will point towards their vehicle, for example, and players can now change the keybind for the boost button. Players on Steam can opt-in to the update by right-clicking Starfield in their library, selecting Properties, and then selecting Betas to download the new beta update.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">promised fans of Starfield</a> that the team was hard at work and that there are "lots of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about."</p><p dir="ltr">What those "exciting things" will be is still unclear, but there is some recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-still-not-confirmed-but-new-evidence-emerges/1100-6530141/" data-ref-id="1100-6530141">evidence to suggest Starfield could finally be arriving on PlayStation 5</a> sooner rather than later.

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA authorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">a voice actors strike</a> against the major video game publishers, largely over the issue of AI protections. Nearly 300 days later, that's still the final point of contention between both sides. Now, the publishers have released what they characterize as the "best and last" offer for actors. And the actors have fired back with their counteroffer, all in the court of public opinion.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-actors-strike-saga-aftra-final-offer-1236387081/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the latest contract proposals between the studios and the actors have found common ground on most of the terms for a new deal. That includes 24% wage increases over the life of the contract. But the two sides' lack of agreement over generative AI continues to prolong the strike.</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game publishers, told Variety that, "We are hopeful the union will not choose to walk away when we are so close to a deal."</p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA noted that the video game publishers presented their latest offer on April 30, and the actors responded with a counter-proposal on May 2. According to the actors, the publishers didn't respond to that before making the negotiation terms public. SAG-AFTRA subsequently released its proposal online as well.</p><p>"SAG-AFTRA condemns the video game companies' attempt to sow confusion in the community by releasing misleading rhetoric about our ongoing negotiations," said the union through a spokesperson. "The statement suggesting that the union would 'walk away' from negotiations on this contract is absurd and the opposite of the truth. It is the employers who have threatened--through backchannel representatives--to move work to foreign countries and recast performers, in an unsuccessful effort to intimidate our negotiating committee and membership to capitulate to their demands."</p><p>Voice actors from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">Spider-Man, Resident Evil</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">Mass Effect</a> have previously spoken out about why the performers need protections from AI that could potentially recreate their voices without compensating the performers.

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> trailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">finally here</a>, but what song is playing in it? Whereas the first trailer from December 2023 used Tom Petty's "Love Is A Long Road," this one features the song "Hot Together" by The Pointer Sisters. The song was written by Sharon Robinson and originally released in 1986.</p><p>Similarly to how the lyrics to "Love Is A Long Road" seemingly bore a connection to the story of GTA 6, that may also be the case for "Hot Together." The song is about a couple and their intense, passionate physical and emotional love. The tune tells the story of lovers who could be "hot together."</p><p>"We both know that it could feel good, so good / You led me through the crowded room / And out into the night / You kissed me like you did before / In the quiet of the moonlight," is one of the verses from the song.</p><p>The GTA 6 trailer, meanwhile, shows main characters Jason and Lucia reconnecting after Lucia's stint in prison. There are some steamy scenes in the trailer, too, and it's clear the two are lovers with a complicated connection given their penchant for crime.</p><p>Many have already remarked that GTA 6's story appears to be similar in nature to the story of Bonnie and Clyde, two American outlaws and lovers known for robbing banks and killing people together.</p><p>"Love Is A Long Road" saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-helps-tom-petty-song-surge-37000-on-spotify/1100-6519729/" data-ref-id="1100-6519729">huge boost to its streaming numbers</a> after it was included in GTA 6's first trailer, and it's expected that something similar could happen with "Hot Together."</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That's a while to wait, so in the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">more than 150 new GTA 6 images </a>in the gallery below. Beyond Jason and Lucia, GTA 6's story features a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">big cast of supporting characters</a>. And in terms of places you'll visit, GTA 6 takes players to Vice City itself, along with the surrounding areas, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/" data-ref-id="2900-6538">a park filled with wildlife.</a></p>

                <p>During a livestream reveal event for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2: </a>The Edge of Fate, Bungie announced that it will be introducing World Tiers. These are customizable location difficulties, with varying difficulty and increased rewards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489294-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent38-1screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489294-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent38-1screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489294"></a><figcaption>Three guardians explore Kepler</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489294-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent38-1screenshot.png"></figure><p>Robbie Stevens, Destiny's assistant game director, announced the addition and commented that as Guardians play through the main story quest, they'll unlock more world tiers and therefore higher difficulties.</p><p>"World Tiers allow you to take on a higher level of challenge," Stevens explains, mentioning that the higher the difficulty, the better the loot you will receive. Think of it in a similar way to Diablo's world tiers. The higher ones are more challenging, but also the most rewarding in terms of gear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlylquFX6EE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qlylquFX6EE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The first location to receive this treatment will be Kepler. This new location will be introduced with The Edge of Fate and, unlike its real-world counterpart, will exist within the solar system, right on the edge of it. Bungie didn't note whether the location difficulty customization will extend to its existing locations, or just be rolled out across new expansions.</p><p>We don't have long to wait to find out, since Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, as well as the names of the next three expansions in the Destiny 2 roadmap.</p>
