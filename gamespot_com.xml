                <p>The original Dreamcast controller was a revolutionary device when the console launched in the late '90s, but in 2025, it might feel dated for retro gaming fans. Luckily, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ3NNMF7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Fighters D6 wireless controller</a> just launched, which aims to give Dreamcast fans a more modernized gamepad. It's also compatible with the Dreamcast, Nintendo Switch, and PC, making it a great device for playing on original hardware or playing ports of Dreamcast games, such as the upcoming inclusions of Power Stone 1 and 2 in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-fighting-collection-2-preorders-free-comic-book-deals-release-date/1100-6528240/" data-ref-id="1100-6528240">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> launching later this year.</p><div title="6529935 - Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast Wireless Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3225" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529935 - Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast Wireless Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$55</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Available in both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ44C5WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ3NNMF7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> models, the Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller features a six-button design and a D-pad with dedicated Kailh micro-switches. There are also two customizable modes for the C and Z buttons, including a classic Dreamcast mode. It also uses 2.4 Ghz wireless technology via a dongle that can be inserted into a Dreamcast or other compatible devices. This makes it well-suited for fighting games on the Dreamcast, like Street Fighter Alpha 3, Soul Calibur, and Marvel vs Capcom 2. The Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller also works on PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>                      </div><p>If you're looking for other modern-style gamepads that are great for playing older video games, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKX7JZQD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8Bitdo 64 Bluetooth controller</a> is worth checking out. The wireless controller is geared toward people who are planning to pick up the new Nintendo 64 FPGA console, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-fully-unveils-its-modernized-n64-preorders-go-live-october-21/1100-6527188/" data-ref-id="1100-6527188">Analogue 3D</a>, but it will also be compatible with PC, Switch, and Android devices. The controller features a similar layout as the original N64 controller but with several improvements, including anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, a more modern ergonomic design, wireless Bluetooth connectivity, and support for 8BitDo's desktop app that lets you customize button layouts and more.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller is scheduled to launch for $40 on June 30 and will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKX7JZQD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> models. However, it's likely that the launch date could change, considering the Analogue 3D console was recently delayed. Nevertheless, you can preorder both models at Amazon.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-hd-remaster-collection-is-steeply-discounted-for-pc-on-launch-day/1100-6526150/">Suikoden HD Remaster Collection Is Steeply Discounted For PC On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-master-sword-replica-on-sale-for-big-discount-at-amazon/1100-6523376/">Zelda Master Sword Replica On Sale For Big Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>In just over a month, players will have a better idea of what to expect from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> when it's showcased during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>. Because Nintendo had to share certain technical specs with the Federal Communication Commission ahead of time, players are now privy to a few additional details about the upcoming console.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the FCC has <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=eI2H2dVQ5qDgaEf8hlh%2FwQ%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKEBEE001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted some of the Switch 2 technical specs</a> online. While most of these reports are very dry with technical jargon, they do indicate that Switch 2 will support near field communication, or NFC, which is how the Amiibo figures were able to connect with Nintendo's previous console to unlock new in-game content. It's also been confirmed that the radio-frequency identification (RFID) feature is located in the right Joy-Con, just as it was in the first Switch. While that's not 100% confirmation that Amiibos will continue to be utilized with the Switch 2, it certainly seems likely that they will. </p><p>The FCC filings indicate that Switch 2 will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth. That's an upgrade from the original Switch's Wi-Fi 5 capabilities, but not as fast as Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. These reports also confirm that Switch 2 has two USB-C ports, one at the top and one at the bottom. The system can be charged through either of those ports.</p><p>A previously released Japanese patent application revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-patent-application-seems-to-confirm-switch-2-joy-con-feature/1100-6529310/" data-ref-id="1100-6529310">Switch 2's Joy-Cons will have mouse-like capabilities</a>. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested the company must push "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-switch-2-coming-nintendo-explains-why-it-must-go-beyond-traditional-games/1100-6529363/" data-ref-id="1100-6529363">beyond video games</a>" to get people to engage with more than just its games and consoles. It's not entirely clear what that means for Switch 2 yet, but hopefully more answers will be shared soon.</p>
