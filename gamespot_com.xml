                <p><a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Samantha_Kelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samantha Kelly</a>, who has voiced Princess Peach and Toad in Nintendo games for nearly two decades, is seemingly no longer going to play those parts going forward. Kelly announced today, June 6, that Nintendo is recasting Peach and Todd with other actors.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samanthakellypeach/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Instagram</a>, Kelly thanked fans for "so many years of friendship and joy." Kelly said she is "sad that it's over," adding that she would have liked to voice Peach and Toad for her entire life. She said she was informed of the decision on June 5, the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> launched. </p><p>"Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love," Kelly wrote.</p><p>Kelly lent her voice to more than 70 Nintendo games, spanning DS, 3DS, Wii, Wii U, and Switch. She also did voices for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to IGN.</a></p><p>Kelly confirmed her departure from voicing Peach and Toad after fans did not find her name in the Mario Kart World credits. Takashi Nagasako, who has voiced Donkey Kong for 20+ years, is also missing from the game's credits.</p><p>In 2023, longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet stopped voicing Mario and transitioned to an ambassador role for Nintendo, a role that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-has-no-idea-what-a-mario-ambassador-does/1100-6517466/" data-ref-id="1100-6517466">even Martinet does not understand the meaning of.</a></p>

                <p>During the early stages of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, you'll be tasked with acquiring a few basic resources that will serve as the foundation of your character's gear and base items. Some of these resources include Granite, Plant Fiber, and Salvaged Metal. You'll also be asked to add some Fuel Cells to your inventory, as those are what you use to power anything electronic in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>When it comes to Granite and Plant Fiber, you'll have no issues whatsoever finding either of those resources, as they're as abundant as the sand on Arrakis. However, Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells take a little more searching to find. Below, you can see exactly how to get Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells for all of your early game needs in Dune: Awakening.</p><h2>Where to find Salvaged Metal in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Out of the two resources, Salvaged Metal is the easier one to find. One of your first missions in Dune: Awakening requires you to find 250 of the resource, though, which isn't so easy.</p><p>Salvaged Metal can be looted as a single item all around the starting area of Dune: Awakening. It looks like a small metal box that's usually lying on the sand near rocky formations. Of course, while you can pick up a few of these pieces, that's not going to get you nearly close to the amount you need.</p><p>The best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in large quantities is by raiding scavenger camps in the starting region of the game. All around you are small camps, either inside moisture-sealed caves or underneath some rocky cover, that can be looted for solid amounts of Salvaged Metal. Of course, these camps aren't unoccupied, so you'll have to kill scavengers to get your hands on the resource.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822"></a><figcaption>Scavenger camps are the best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in the early game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png"></figure><p>When you're looting a camp, you can find the singular pieces of Salvaged Metal on the ground, but you can also cut open larger pieces of it using your Cutteray. This is the same item you use to cut open Granite Stone boulders, Copper Ore, etc. Scan large pieces of metal with a yellow icon above them, cut where the blue mark is, and you'll loot roughly 40-60 pieces of Salvaged Metal.</p><p>You can also find these large metal pieces out in the world next to singular pieces, but they're far more common to find at camps. Salvaged Metal can be looted in chests at camps as well, but those chests usually have rarer items inside them. You might even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">find some water</a> in these chests, which is as valuable an item as you can have in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>To find a scavenger camp, just open your map and zoom in. Hover over all of the icons to see which ones are camps. You can discover every camp for yourself by eventually crafting a Survey Probe in Dune: Awakening, but that only comes after you make Copper Ingots at a Fabricator inside your base once you complete your first trial mission.</p><h2>Where to find Fuel Cells in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Unfortunately, Fuel Cells are often located in the same areas as Salvaged Metal, but they're found in far fewer numbers. Fuel Cells look like small, rectangular cartridges on the ground, and you can often find them lying right next to Salvaged Metal pieces.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821"></a><figcaption>A Fuel Cell lying on the floor of a scavenger camp</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png"></figure><p>Instead of looking on the ground for Fuel Cells, though, you want to find scavenger camps with chests in them. Chests have a high chance of containing Fuel Cells and other rarer items, so looting them is one of the most consistent ways to acquire the resource.</p><p>To make your Fuel Cell farming process even better, chests at camps, as well as all world resources, are on a respawn timer in Dune: Awakening. After one in-game day, every item, enemy, resource, and chest in the world and at camps will respawn, allowing you to loot everything over again. If you find a route with plenty of scavenger camps on it, you can make a few runs within a couple of hours and stock up on every resource you might need.</p><p>Scavenger camps and world looting aren't the only ways to acquire Fuel Cells, though. You can also head up to trader camps, like the one at the Griffin Research Tradepost, and purchase Fuel Cells for money. While this isn't the most efficient way to acquire the resource, spending 50 Solari per Fuel Cell isn't a bad fee if you need them in a pinch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820"></a><figcaption>Fuel Cells on sale for 50 Solari in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png"></figure><p>As you progress in Dune: Awakening, you'll find more trader camps and more ways of acquiring both Fuel Cells and Salvaged Metal. However, for the early game, stick to scavenger camps, traders, and simple world looting.</p><p>If you're playing Dune: Awakening on PC, you're probably experiencing some performance issues, so make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-for-dune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">best PC settings to improve FPS and reduce stutters</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Numbers skin was part of the "Frank Woods Operator Pack," which was a preorder bonus given out to those who preordered the digital or Vault edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The Numbers skin featured Woods surrounded by glowing red numbers, but it appears a bug from the recent update caused his entire body to have an intense glow.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just a temporary removal. Players who try to use the Numbers skin during this time will spawn in as the default Woods skin instead. This is an ongoing investigation, so there's currently no date given for when the skin will return. The Season 4 update had a rough launch, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy multiplayer lobbies</a> and Warzone server issues.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Call of Duty features a crossover event with the Ballerina movie, which is part of the John Wick universe. Players can earn free cosmetics and unlock a new marksman rifle during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/#2">Ballerina event in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>. The movie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/">Eve Macarro also has an operator bundle</a> available in Call of Duty's in-game shop.</p>

                <p>Now that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its initial wave of accessories have made it into fans' hands, players have been surprised to discover that Nintendo's GameCube controller for the Switch 2 supports gyro controls.</p><p>The new controller, available exclusively through Nintendo Switch Online and at select physical Nintendo stores, looks almost exactly like an original GameCube controller but features some key upgrades. The original c-stick doubles as the Switch 2's new C-button, which will open GameChat, and the internals have been re-arranged for a more responsive d-pad, according to a parts breakdown on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l3u79o/took_them_nearly_24_years_but_they_finally_fixed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo GameCube Classics – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The most surprising new addition is the gyroscope, which wasn't mentioned by Nintendo in the lead-up to the Switch 2's release. Surprised fans instead discovered the added functionality themselves upon unboxing the new controller--such as Japanese Splatoon content creator <a href="https://x.com/sashibu2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sashibu</a>, who posted to X about the new option to play Splatoon with a GameCube controller.</p><p>Gyroscopic controls were first introduced to mainstream gaming with the Wii MotionPlus in 2009, and have remained in use by Nintendo in each of their consoles since. A <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_games_that_support_gyro_controls" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decent number</a> of Switch titles make use of gyroscopic controls for aiming (the Wii and Wii U both made us of a sensor bar), while some also use them in more novel ways.</p><p>When the GameCube controller for the Switch 2 was first announced, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-one-major-limitation/1100-6530712/" data-ref-id="1100-6530712">Nintendo warned</a> that it was only compatible with GameCube titles in the Nintendo Switch Online Classics library. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamecube-controller-works-outside-of-switch-online-but-could-run-into-issues/1100-6531045/" data-ref-id="1100-6531045">later clarified</a> that it could be used with any game on the Switch 2, but that issues may arise due to lacking features or buttons found on other controllers. The addition of gyro controls and the C-Button seems to contradict the idea that the controller is designed exclusively for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/" data-ref-id="2900-6400">GameCube games on Switch 2</a> (none of which support gyro input) but consider yourself warned.</p><p>The GameCube controller is available to order only for Nintendo Switch Online members, with a limit of one per person. The controller can also be bought in person at select Nintendo stores.</p>
