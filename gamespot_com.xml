                <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a> may want to take note that there's a new third-person action-RPG that blends magic and gunplay. Nesting Games has announced The Directorate: Novitiate, a game that puts players in control of Kana Luna. By day, Kana is just a normal young woman living in Los Angeles in 2006. But by night, Kana goes by the codename Mercury while working as a magical assassin for the criminal underworld. In the first-look trailer below, Mercury uses her innate fighting and magic skills to take on human foes and otherworldly threats.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfQXCis_qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9lfQXCis_qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Mercury, Kana can upgrade her magical abilities to further refine her combat options. Mercury isn't limited to only using guns in battle, and she can incorporate spells into her offense as well. Additionally, the game will be divided between Mercury's activities after dark--including her hunt for a supernatural serial killer--and her normal life as Kana during the day.</p><p>Outside of her working hours, Kana can pursue friendships or romance with the people she meets. However, those choices may endanger Kana's loved ones when the two sides of her life collide. According to Nesting Games, players will ultimately have the option of deciding whether Mercury will stay loyal to "the Edicts of the Directorate" or if she will decide to retain her humanity as Kana. Those choices will define Mercury's portrayal in the game.</p><p>The Directorate: Novitiate can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted on Steam</a>, and early access is expected to debut later this year. For now, there's no word about whether The Directorate: Novitiate will also be available on consoles.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has confirmed the title, setting, and release window of the next piece of DLC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">Tom Clancy's The Division 2.</a> It's titled Battle for Brooklyn and will be released before the end of 2025.</p><p>The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has seen a healthy amount of post-launch support from Ubisoft since then. 2020's Warlords of New York DLC brought the series back to Manhattan, the setting of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division/" data-ref-id="5000-184123">first game in the series</a>. Ubisoft had previously teased that a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/72VfO2i8dx7NAhQ2DAHNJ5/year-6-the-division-2-the-road-ahead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC set in Brooklyn</a> was in the works for Year 6 of support, but it faced a series of delays as Ubisoft focused on other aspects of the game.</p><p>As recently as January 28, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft told players</a> that the DLC would not ship during the Year 6 series of seasonal updates "to ensure we deliver the best possible experience." While that caused worry that the DLC could slip out of 2025 as well, Ubisoft took to X today, January 30, to share the first piece of key art and the title of the DLC.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Agents! We are heading back to New York. The Battle for Brooklyn DLC will be launching this year. Here's a sneak peekâ€”for your eyes only! ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://t.co/dRHLG5eVyB" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/dRHLG5eVyB</a></p>  â€” Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>That key art doesn't reveal much about the DLC, featuring a squad of three exploring a street of Brooklyn with the Brooklyn Bridge in view. Previously, players were only able to briefly explore Brooklyn during the tutorial of The Division, so this DLC should offer a brand-new map to explore alongside a plethora of other new content.</p><p>Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is available for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Year 7 of support for The Division 2 should begin sometime in June 2025, so expect Battle for Brooklyn to launch in the back half of the year.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Anthem Animated Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer mainly focuses on Octane as he battles his way through a match, but we also see what Legends like Alter and Loba get up to between matches: Loba steals stuff, and Alter terrorizes her interdimensional enemies. But a crowd of spectators and fans are also featured in the trailer, with many of them cosplaying as their favorite Legend.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Octane nearly bites the dust, but comes out on top with a narrow victory. The crowd goes wild, and the trailer cuts to a shot of Titanfall 2 big bad Kuben Blisk, who also serves as the official Apex Games commissioner. Blisk looks especially pleased with himself, as if Octane's win might be something he was hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that's notably missing from the trailer is a new Legend. The trailer shows off plenty of familiar faces, but so far, it doesn't look like Season 24 will come with a new playable Legend.</p><p>Although the trailer does provide the name of Season 24 (Takeover), it doesn't provide any details on when the season will launch. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/takeover" rel="nofollow ">Season 24 page</a> on the official Apex Legends website simply reads, "We live to fight," followed by a promise that more details are coming next week. The end of the animated trailer says that a gameplay trailer is coming soon, but doesn't provide a specific date for the trailer or the launch of Season 24, though the new season is likely set to launch in early February.</p>

                <p>PlayStation celebrated its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-kicks-off-with-nostalgic-ps5-themes-and-the-cranberries/1100-6528157/" data-ref-id="1100-6528157">30th anniversary last December </a>and released several PS5 themes commemorating the occasion. Now, the themes are leaving tomorrow, January 31, but won't be gone for good.</p><p>"Thank you for the fantastic response to the classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 limited-time console themes, which will be leaving tomorrow," PlayStation said on Twitter. "Due to the positive response on these 4 themes, weâ€™re doing some work behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1884979891067863448" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Thank you for the fantastic response to the classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 limited-time console themes, which will be leaving tomorrow. <br>Due to the positive response on these 4 themes, weâ€™re doing some work behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in theâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/KYk5DHQ3wO" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/KYk5DHQ3wO</a></p>  â€” PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1884979891067863448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, PlayStation also clarified that there aren't any plans to create additional themes in the future. While these anniversary themes were initially only available for a limited time, many players have been calling for PlayStation to make them permanent.</p><p>Players were able to switch between different themes with elements of PlayStation's classic hardware through the years. The PS1 theme shows part of the original gray box and the PS2 theme references the console's 3D blocks. The PS3 theme has a horizontal screen that references the console's XMB screen.</p><p>PS5 owners can't apply themes aside from the 30th-anniversary collection, even as the demand for themes on PS5 seems to be high. In the meantime, players can customize the PS5's Welcome Hub, which is as close as it currently gets.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, it's dropping the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-is-offering-some-sweet-treats-if-you-play-its-pc-games-with-a-psn-account/1100-6529100/" data-ref-id="1100-6529100">PSN account requirement for select games on PC</a>, and PlayStation will have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-leadership-shake-up-sees-new-sole-ceo-in-charge/1100-6529087/" data-ref-id="1100-6529087">new sole CEO starting on April 1</a>.</p>

                <p>Tomb Raider fans have been eagerly awaiting a new game in the series since 2018's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-guerilla-girl/1900-6416982/" data-ref-id="1900-6416982">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. But since it's anyone's guess when Lara Croft's next adventure will arrive, players may have to be satisfied by the return of one of her spin-off games. Feral Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light-review/1900-6280082/" data-ref-id="1900-6280082">Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</a> is coming to iOS and Android platforms on February 27.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-ufAlMu9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JC-ufAlMu9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was originally released on Xbox Live and PSN in 2010, and it dropped the Tomb Raider branding and the series' traditional gameplay model. Instead, it adapted a fixed-camera viewpoint and embraced co-op gameplay as Lara teamed up with an ancient Mayan warrior called Totec to defeat the evil spirit known as Xolotl. Feral Interactive previously ported The Guardian of Light and its 2014 sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review/1900-6415985/" data-ref-id="1900-6415985">Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</a>, to Nintendo Switch as part of The Lara Croft Collection in 2023.</p><p>Outside of the gaming realm, there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series/1100-6523431/" data-ref-id="1100-6523431">live-action Tomb Raider series</a> in development at Prime Video that may star Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-star-sophie-turner-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-tomb-raider-tv-show-report/1100-6527775/" data-ref-id="1100-6527775">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>.

Additionally, Netflix renewed the animated series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-renewed-for-season-2/1100-6527395/" data-ref-id="1100-6527395">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft for a second season</a>.</p><p>Console gamers may want to pass the time between sequels with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-versions-coming-to-switch-xbox-and-playstation/1100-6527121/" data-ref-id="1100-6527121">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a>, which features modern ports of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness.
