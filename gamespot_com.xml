                <p>Later this year, Bitmap Bureau is revisiting the classic sci-fi action film Terminator 2: Judgment Day with a throwback side-scrolling game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F4DXP5FN,B0F4F1V647,B0F4DY6V7S,B0F4F1J8LQ,B0F4F2T4RB,B0F4DX5JBY,B0F4F3GRF7,B0F4F1GTJR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>. That game had been expected to launch in early September. However, No Fate's publisher Reef Entertainment has announced that the game's release is being slightly delayed.</p><p>According to the message shared on Reef's social media accounts, the new release date for Terminator 2D: No Fate is Halloween, October 31, with the team deciding to give Bitmap Bureau "extra time to work on some final refinements for the day one patch," which is why both the physical and the digital versions of the game had to be held back.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1947688265047298504" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025.<br>Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us.…</p>  — Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1947688265047298504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-day-one-collector-edition-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6530886/" data-ref-id="1100-6530886">two physical editions of Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> were announced earlier this year. There's a standard edition for $60, and a $120 collector's edition that features a reversible box art sleeve, a cloth poster. a 25mm collectible metal arcade coin featuring the game's logo, a full-color manual, and a collector’s box.</p><p>As for the game itself, the story will largely focus on Sarah Connor and the heroic T-800 as players assume those roles to protect John Connor from the T-1000 while attempting to prevent Skynet and its machines from nearly exterminating the human race. In a new twist, players will also be able to control the adult John Connor during levels set in the future war against Skynet.</p><p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available on Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 31.</p><p>The most recent film in the franchise was Terminator: Dark Fate in 2019, which had a dismal response at the box office. Regardless, James Cameron--the director of the first two Terminator films--has hinted that he is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-cameron-hints-at-new-terminator-project/1100-6525759/" data-ref-id="1100-6525759">his own Terminator project</a> for the future.

The big draw here is the sheer size of the game's roster, as it looks like just about every character from the show will be present and ready to throw down. Players assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing for special attacks to be chained together. When combined with the new "Rising" gameplay system, these heroes and villains can dish out a significant amount of damage during combat. The game also looks fantastic in action, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-hero-academias-next-game-already-looks-like-a-big-leap-forward-from-ones-justice/1100-6532925/" data-ref-id="1100-6532925">as the reveal trailer</a> showed off slick cel-shaded graphics.</p><p>So far, only a standard edition has been announced for All's Justice, and no preorder bonuses have been confirmed. However, we'll update this post if any additional versions or preorder incentives are announced. Physical PS5 and Xbox Series X copies are available to preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're unfamiliar with My Hero Academia, the series began as a manga written by Kōhei Horikoshi and was then adapted into the now-popular anime series. My Hero Academia takes place in a world where certain people have superpowers, known as "Quirks." This has given rise to a new era of superheroes who protect the people from villains who use their quirks for crime, and the greatest of these public defenders is All Might. The series' protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, dreams of becoming a hero, but was born without a Quirk. However, a chance encounter with All Might allows him to inherit the ailing hero's powers, which makes him eligible to enroll at the prestigious UA Academy for upcoming superheroes.</p><p>My Hero Academia quickly became a smash hit in print and on TV thanks to its likeable everyman protagonist, colorful supporting cast, and a Japanese take on western comic books, and it will be interesting to see how the new My Hero Academia: All's Justice 3D fighting game will adapt the elements and expand upon the previously released 3D MHA fighting games released so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278"></a><figcaption>My Hero Academia manga</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg"></figure><p>While waiting for My Hero Academia: All Justice, you can catch up on the anime saga, as most of it is available on Blu-ray.
