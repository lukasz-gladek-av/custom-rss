                <p>During its showcase on March 25, Capcom teased the return of a fan-favorite monster to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> for its second title update, coming this summer.</p><p>In the showcase, a fleeting few seconds at the end of the video show the signature long, taloned claws of Lagiacrus. Introduced in Monster Hunter 3, Lagiacrus is a mammoth Leviathan. Shifting colors between gray-blue when dry, and deep blue when wet, Lagiacrus has been a fan-favorite for some time, achieving third place in Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary vote for Hunters' Choice of top monster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464892-mhw-second-teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464892-mhw-second-teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464892"></a><figcaption>Lagiacrus has been teased for MHW second title update</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464892-mhw-second-teaser.jpg"></figure><p>Previously holding a flagship monster title for the third generation, fans of the series knew Lagiacrus was being teased as soon as underwater noises were heard, nodding to its hunt location in previous games. Previously, encounters with Lagiacrus have taken place underwater, so here's hoping a similar fight style will be available when the second title update arrives in Summer 2025.</p><p>Underwater combat hasn't featured in any of the series' installments since Monster Hunter 3, also known as Tri, so Lagiacrus has been largely neglected since its first appearance, but the teaser understandably has Hunters eager to discover the context it will manifest in throughout Wilds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464893-mhw-second-teaser%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464893-mhw-second-teaser%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464893"></a><figcaption>Lagiacrus in Monster Hunter Tri</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464893-mhw-second-teaser%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Lagiacrus was slated to return to Monster Hunter World and Rise, but Capcom stated it faced issues with the skeletal structure of the leviathan in the engines used to create the games.</p><p>Capcom also announced the contents of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunts-wilds-first-title-update-adds-grand-hub-new-monsters-and-more/1100-6530343/" data-ref-id="1100-6530343"> first Monster Hunter Wilds title update</a>, as well as the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-festival-of-accord-blossomdance-event-overhauls-new-grand-hub-area/1100-6530345/" data-ref-id="1100-6530345">Blossomdance event </a>which takes place over a limited time and transforms the game's new Grand Hub area.</p>

                <p>Ahead of its launch later this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> has overtaken Hollow Knight: Silksong in order to become the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p><p>This was spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sims-rival-inzoi-has-become-the-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, who monitored data directly from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and third-party websites like SteamDB. Although Hollow Knight: Silksong technically has more followers on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>, that data shows that over 52,000 people have wishlisted InZoi prior to its March 27 launch, skyrocketing its follower total to over 244,000. That's enough to make it display as the most wishlisted game on Steam. The top five is rounded out, in order, by Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JANvRG0ehgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JANvRG0ehgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi is a life sim game that clearly draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/as-the-sims-turns-25-ea-wants-to-embrace-the-series-past/2900-6185/" data-ref-id="2900-6185">series like The Sims</a>. Players can create and customize virtual humans called "Zois," before watching them go about their daily lives. When InZoi comes out this Friday, it'll be part of the Steam Early Access program. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">early-access review of InZoi</a> saw potential in what it played, praising its visuals and customizations, but noted that there's still much to improve regarding gameplay.</p><p>InZoi launches into early access on March 27, so it'll lose that most-wishlisted spot soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> still does not have a release date at this time, it seems bound to retake that top slot on Steam's most wishlisted ranking.</p>

                <p>The GTA modder and superfan who goes by the handle Dark Space caught the attention of fans by recently releasing a playable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-of-gta-6s-map-has-been-brought-into-gta-5-by-a-superfan/1100-6529130/" data-ref-id="1100-6529130">recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. However, he has announced that he has ceased all work on the project after being struck by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.</p><p>Dark Space created the free-to-download map solely based on the official trailer shots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and some unverified leaks, then uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. GTA fans who have been feeling deprived of any new information about the upcoming game downloaded the modded map off FiveM en masse. That's when he noticed messages from YouTube about his videos being taken down due to a copyright strike. </p><p>In an explanation video, the creator says that Take-Two requested that his videos be removed, resulting in his first copyright strike. Multiple strikes can result in the termination of an entire channel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7LmLfJAuR_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I've also removed the download link to my mod, even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space said in the video. "I think it's smarter to get in front of them than waiting for their email that will never come. To avoid another copyright strike from Take-Two, I'm not going to use any footage from Grand Theft Auto in this video." He went on to explain how he ended up in this situation, giving a brief history of the modding and map-making community for GTA and how they were trying to guess how big the map was going to be in GTA 6.</p><p>"So why did they remove my video and take away my month's income that I spent two months hard to earn? Well, my guess is that the map is a little too accurate," he continued. "They must feel some sort of threat from it existing because they feel that having a playable version of the map to drive around in could ruin the surprise and newness of GTA 6 when it releases."</p><p>That kind of removal request seemed almost inevitable. Former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij recently commented on the frequent takedowns by Take-Two, saying they are "entirely predictable."</p><p dir="ltr">"They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests," he <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1883238047015149881" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a> back in January. "The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.) There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released this fall on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. There has not been an announcement date for a PC release but that will likely be coming later.</p>
