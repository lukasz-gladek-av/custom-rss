                <p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassin-s-creed-unity-review/1900-6415948/" data-ref-id="1900-6415948">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, the eighth game in Ubisoft's long-running franchise. The game was set in Paris during the French Revolution in the late 18th century, and it included a meticulous recreation of the city, including the famous Notre Dame cathedral. However, Ubisoft admitted to taking some liberties with Notre Dame's appearance in a recent video timed to coincide with the reopening of the cathedral five years after it was devastated by a fire.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbRpnqp2y_0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LbRpnqp2y_0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As related in the video above, the decision was made to include Notre Dame's iconic spire even though it wasn't added to the cathedral until 1859, roughly seven decades after the events of Assassin's Creed Unity. Ubisoft kept the spire in the game because it's so ingrained with the image of Notre Dame for modern viewers. The cathedral itself dates back to the 12th century, and it took 182 years to complete construction.</p><p>After the 2019 fire damaged large sections of Notre Dame, it took the better part of half a decade to restore it. However, some of Notre Dame's repairs are still ongoing regardless of the reopening.</p><p>Ubisoft's video was accompanied by the announcement that the video game publisher has teamed up with the Notre Dame visitors app. It will use assets from Assassin's Creed Unity to display images from areas of the cathedral that are inaccessible to the public. Ubisoft has also released Notre-Dame de Paris: Journey Back in Time VR experience for free <a href="https://www.meta.com/fr-fr/experiences/notre-dame-de-paris-journey-back-in-time/5879281975416682/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the Meta store</a>. That includes a virtual walkthrough of the cathedral, as well as a hot-air-balloon tour of 18th-century Paris at the conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-syndicate-review/1900-6416291/" data-ref-id="1900-6416291">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>--the immediate follow-up to Unity--recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-assassins-creed-game-from-nearly-a-decade-ago-just-got-a-60fps-patch/1100-6527835/" data-ref-id="1100-6527835">received a 60fps upgrade</a> on the current-generation consoles.

                <p>Monument Valley 3, the third entry in the indie puzzle game series, is out today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monument-valley-3-announced-exclusively-for-netflix-games-at-gamescom-with-prequel-ports/1100-6525992/" data-ref-id="1100-6525992">exclusively on Netflix Games</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-a-monument-valley-for-the-netflix-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, developer Ustwo spoke about its history with mobile platforms and how introducing live-service elements to Monument Valley 3 was a natural transition. Usetwo is planning to release new content for Monument Valley 3 with every real-life season, along with new activities and puzzles on a regular basis. Previous games in the series had DLC.</p><p>"But for Monument Valley, [we've] always done downloadable content. It's just less rhythmic, less predictable, when they come out," explained director Jennifer Estaris. "And so for me, it was about. How do we make that a healthy habit for players, where they can know that something is coming and they get excited about it? But also tied to the themes of the game about caring for the world, not just being a one-and-done experience."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ew6PCGzOk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E9ew6PCGzOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ustwo's other games have been on Netflix and Apple Arcade before, including Assemble with Care and Desta: The Memories Between, so the developer is comfortable working on mobile platforms. Monument Valley, after all, is a series that started on mobile devices before coming to PC.</p><p>"Personally, I don't think Monument Valley 3 would be a Monument Valley game if it had to mould itself to the requirements of a free-to-play model in order to survive," said lead producer Jonathan Lau. "So it could only have survived on a subscription service, regardless of who that was with."</p><p>So far, Monument Valley 3 is sitting at around a 70 average on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monument-valley-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a> with three reviews in. Both Monument Valley and its sequel are available on Netflix as well. Given that they also received PC versions later on, it's possible Monument Valley 3 might too, but as of now, it's exclusive to Netflix.</p>
