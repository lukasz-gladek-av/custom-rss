                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a>, the popular ghosthunting sim from Kinetic Games, is being turned into a horror movie. The film is coming from Blumhouse, a production company that has made a great number of horror movies in recent years, including Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious, among many more. James Wan's company, Atomic Monster, is also attached to the project.</p><p>The game studio's director and lead developer, Daniel Knight, said in a press release that the team is "thrilled" to announce the movie is in the works. "We never could’ve imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we’re so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond," Knight continued. "Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can’t wait to share more as the project develops."</p><p>Phasmophobia launched as a Steam Early Access game in 2020 and quickly became a hit for friend groups looking for a fun (and terrifying) co-op game during the pandemic. It's gone on to sell more than 22 million copies, and last year debuted on Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The next major update for the game is called Chronicle and seeks to overhaul the game's leveling system and in-game rewards. Sometime next year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-phasmophobia-to-be-so-terrifying-the-devil-is-in-the-details/1100-6527456/" data-ref-id="1100-6527456">already-frightening game</a> is meant to get even scarier with its Horror 2.0 update.</p><p>No release window for the Phasmophobia movie was announced, and it's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/" data-ref-id="2900-5059">video game movies get announced</a> much more often than they get made. However, given the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-succeeded-beyond-my-wildest-dreams-creator-says/1100-6518853/" data-ref-id="1100-6518853">Five Nights at Freddy's movie's success</a>, one could argue Blumhouse knows how to get these projects to the finish line--a sequel to that one is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-a-creepy-new-teaser-image/1100-6532000/" data-ref-id="1100-6532000">set to arrive later this year</a>.</p>
