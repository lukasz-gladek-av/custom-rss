                <p dir="ltr">For the first time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cloverpit/">CloverPit</a> is available on console after surprise-releasing yesterday on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass (Ultimate and Premium tiers). The slot machine roguelike takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, even featuring Jimbo from the former in the new Xbox launch trailer seen below. Players are tasked with paying off their gambling debt from inside a disgusting cell, and if they can't, they take a terrible tumble.</p><p dir="ltr">CloverPit originally came out on Steam on September 26. It was one of the games that actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-demo-released-for-game-delayed-by-silksong/1100-6534469/">delayed its release to avoid Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on September 4. CloverPit planned to launch September 3 initially. That change of course seems to have played out favorably for the roguelike, as publisher Future Friends Games and developer Panik Arcade have stated CloverPit has sold over 1 million copies on Steam so far.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEGZsVMdizs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gEGZsVMdizs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Panik Arcade teased new DLC for CloverPit in the Xbox launch trailer as well. <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1991584781004353984" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the developer notes that the add-on will be named Unholy Fusion and will release on PC and Xbox. However, it's unknown at this time if it will be free or paid DLC.</p><p>CloverPit costs $10 on Xbox for players without Game Pass Ultimate and Premium. The roguelike's surprise-release was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-partner-preview-showcase-every-game-and-announcement/2900-7271/#1"> part of the Xbox Partner Preview event</a> earlier this week. Another notable indie title headed to Game Pass was announced at the presentation, too: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-vampire-survivors-game-crawlers-is-a-big-departure-will-launch-on-game-pass/1100-6536365/">Vampire Crawlers</a>. It's the follow-up from developer Poncle to Vampire Survivors, though this time, the game is a deckbuilding dungeon crawler.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Partner Preview showed off a bunch of cool and interesting projects coming to Xbox consoles and PC in the future, including Armatus, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, and Raji: Kaliyuga. However, the event itself bucked an annoying trend that other trailer showcases continue to follow, as each trailer that aired during the event showed the logos for <em>every</em> console the game will launch on, not just Xbox.</p><p>Traditionally, when a game makes an appearance during one of these events, the final shot confirms the game for the host company's consoles--PlayStation consoles for Sony, the Switch or Switch 2 for Nintendo, and so on. However, in yesterday's event the PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 logos appeared multiple times throughout the showcase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608421-armatus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608421" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608421-armatus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608421"></a><figcaption>The final shot from the Armatus trailer that aired during the Xbox Partner Preview.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608421-armatus.jpg"></figure><p>Of the 16 titles shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, 13 of them included either a PlayStation or Nintendo Switch logo in their ending graphic. The three exceptions were Echo Generation 2, Roadside Research, and Cloverpit, but all three of them are, as of this writing, only coming to Xbox consoles.</p><p>This small detail seems to be another nod toward Xbox's strategy of catering to as many platforms as possible through its "This is an Xbox" campaign and Xbox Play Anywhere, where players purchase a game on one platform and have access to it on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. The Partner Preview yesterday, in fact, began with the confirmation that every game shown during the event would have Xbox Play Anywhere capabilities.</p><p>The Xbox Partner Preview brought 16 game updates and new reveals, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/im-making-this-for-me-not-to-make-everyone-happy-vampire-survivors-creator-on-his-next-game/1100-6536362/" data-ref-id="1100-6536362">Vampire Crawlers from poncle</a>, the previously-mentioned Armatus from Godfall developer Counterplay Games, and Tides of Annihilation from Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games.</p>
