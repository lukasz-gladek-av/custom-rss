                <p>The release of the upcoming RPG Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely far, far away. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-star-wars-rpg-returns-to-the-old-republic/1100-6536905/" data-ref-id="1100-6536905">last night's announcement trailer</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025</a> was surely exciting for Knights of the Old Republic fans, the truth is that the game, led by original KOTOR and Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, is in a very early stage of development.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Star Wars website</a>, Hudson's new studio, Arcanaut Studios, was formed just this year, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/" data-ref-id="1100-6528039">his previous studio closed</a> in November 2024. The <a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">studio's careers page</a> contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-reminds-fans-that-cg-trailers-are-often-used-first-and-foremost-to-recruit-staff/1100-6496192/" data-ref-id="1100-6496192">tactic that developers often employ</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic: Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable.</p><p>"We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead," Hudson told StarWars.com. "I'm grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR<i> </i>fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!"</p><p>Since his work on the original KOTOR, Hudson stayed in contact with Lucasfilm, and the opportunity arose to make a new title in the Star Wars universe sometime after Arcanaut's founding.</p><p>Details are sparse on the premise. It isn't a direct sequel to Knights of the Old Republic, but Hudson says that the new game introduces new characters and will tell an "all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars<i> </i>that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p><p>The Old Republic has been making the headlines as of late, with a report claiming that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-full-star-wars-kotor-2-remake-was-in-development-report/1100-6536775/" data-ref-id="1100-6536775">KOTOR 2 remake was once in development</a> before being put on hold. And in other Star Wars news, The Game Awards 2025 also included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-announced-the-game-awards/1100-6536876/" data-ref-id="1100-6536876">reveal for Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>.</p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest collab is with Kim Kardashian, and in a new interview, the megastar discussed how the partnership came to be, how good she is at Fortnite, and how closely she worked with Epic to bring her vision to life.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69700805/kim-kardashian-fortnite-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elle Magazine</a>, Kardashian said she is a "decent" Fortnite player. "I wouldn't say I'm great, but I wouldn't say I'm horrible," she said. She added that her son, Saint, is "definitely better than I am."</p><p>"But, you know, he doesn't teach me all of his tricks," she said.</p><p>As for how she came to know Fortnite, Kardashian said her brother introduced her to the game years ago. And while she does play Fortnite, she only does so "moderately" because she believes things should be enjoyed "in moderation."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1t45vRyCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EE1t45vRyCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kardashian also confirmed that she worked closely alongside Epic Games on the collab, saying she spent an hour each night--from 10 to 11 PM--talking with Epic to "perfect everything" and ensure that "everything looked as realistic as possible."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kardashian said Fortnite is an "iconic" game and she is happy to join the ranks of high-profile people and brands that have come to the game over the years. "Just to have seen all of the previous characters and how cute they look, I was really excited to have my own character," she said.</p><p>Kardashian previously worked with Glu Mobile on the popular mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-kim-kardashians-mobile-game-is-really-popular/1100-6434875/" data-ref-id="1100-6434875">Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</a>, but it closed down in early 2024 after about a decade of operation. "I love the gaming space," she said in the interview with Elle.</p><p>One of the emotes for Kardashian in Fortnite is called "Slurp the Internet," and it's a reference to her famous "Break the Internet" shoot for Paper Magazine years ago. In that photo, she has a champagne glass on her butt, but in Fortnite, the champagne glass is on her foot. This is "because it could just fit better and look better," she said. Her other emote is called "Diamond Drop," and it's a reference to how she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJ7butR77g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a diamond earring in the ocean in Bora Bora while filming Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. She said she was "brutalized" over the mishap, and is now having some fun with it.</p><p>"You lose your diamonds in the ocean, and a little boat appears. You're just sitting, crying wherever you're at in the game. We got pretty creative with our emotes," she said.</p><p>Additionally, one of her weapons is a purse, and it's modeled after the one she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U26-nQ-1AdA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smacked Khloé Kardashian with</a>, and it even features the "same movement that I hit her with," she said.</p><p>Kardashian arrives in Fortnite on December 13.

                <p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is "littered with falsehoods and disinformation."</p><p>IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">terminating the 30+ UK and international employees</a> in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason." More specifically, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/" data-ref-id="1100-6536894">Rockstar Games told GameSpot</a> that those developers were let go for discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate.</p><p>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals," the union said in an emailed statement. "Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</p><p>The situation has intensified since bursting in October 2025. Protests were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/07/uk-union-accuses-gta-maker-rockstar-games-of-firing-employees-attempting-to-organise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">formed outside Rockstar North's office</a> in Edinburgh.

                <p>Gears of War fans hoping to see a new trailer for the upcoming prequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, may have been disappointed that it skipped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a> this year. That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026.</p><p>The image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window.</p><p>For now, Gears of War: E-Day is only confirmed for Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, it seems very likely to be the second game in the franchise to make the leap to PlayStation 5, given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>--a remake of the original game--became the first title in the series to appear on a Sony console. Cliff Bleszinski--the co-creator of the franchise--has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-creator-is-thrilled-that-the-franchise-isnt-xbox-exclusive-anymore/1100-6534071/" data-ref-id="1100-6534071">he's happy that the Gears of War games are no longer exclusive</a> to a single console.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but there haven't been many updates about it since that time. Just over a year ago, it was revealed that John DiMaggio (Futurama) and Carlos Ferro <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-is-bringing-back-original-marcus-and-dom-voice-actors/1100-6527641/" data-ref-id="1100-6527641">will reprise their respective roles</a>, Marcus Fenix and Dominic "Dom" Santiago.</p><p>The game is an original prequel story that's set 14 years before the first Gears of War, when Marcus and Dom were still young soldiers in the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Their world, Sera, has finally found some measure of peace before the Locust Horde struck on Emergence Day, which threatens to wipe out all of the humans living on the planet. A new city, Kalona, will be one of the central locations for the story within the game.</p><p>Outside of the gaming realm, John Wick and Deadpool 2 director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-is-excited-about-gears-of-war-movie-and-making-his-first-war-film/1100-6534228/" data-ref-id="1100-6534228">David Leitch is set to direct</a> the live-action Gears of War movie for Netflix. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Dave Bautista has lobbied for years to play Marcus</a>, but he has yet to land the part.</p>
