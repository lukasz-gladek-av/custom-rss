                <p>Niantic has claimed that Pokemon Go will not undergoing any major changes after it was acquired by Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">March for $3.5 billion</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/2504/10/news182.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IT Media</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-go-will-not-change-due-to-scopelys-influence-niantic-assures-following-acquisition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, both Niantic and Scopely met in Japan and put out their first statement regarding the merger. "The direction of our game will not undergo any major changes under the influence of Scopely," a Niantic representative explained. "They will just be supporting its further improvement, and we will keep doing what we’ve been doing since the beginning. To put it more bluntly, please rest assured that we will not be shutting down the game."</p><p>Scopely added that it has evaluated Pokemon Go and how well it has been received by players, indicating that Scopely sees value in the game and wants to continue supporting it.</p><p>At the moment, Niantic and Scopely are implementing a new feature in Pokemon Go called Pokemon Stamp Rally. This lets players visit certain locations to collect stamps and obtain special items and encounter rare Pokemon. The feature is currently only available in Japan and will go into effect on April 13, with the first Stamp Rally event taking place at Osaka World Expo.</p><p>Niantic assured fans who were worried about any negative ramifications of the Scopely buyout that Pokemon Go won't include any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-director-says-players-data-wont-be-sold-no-intrusive-ads/1100-6530200/" data-ref-id="1100-6530200">intrusive ads or sell player data to third parties</a>.

                <p>EA Sports hasn't even officially announced College Football 26, but now more details about the game have emerged from an unexpected source. The home improvement chain Lowe's has <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/press-releases/game-lowes-appear-multiple-ea-sports-titles-first-time-04-11-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> a collaboration with EA Sports to feature its branding in CFB 26, along with the newest EA Sports FC and Madden NFL titles.</p><p>Lowe's branding will appear in these games "across multiple gameplay experiences," the retailer said. For CFB 26, Lowe's branding will show up on the broadcast overlay for the Stadium Pulse feature. This feature aims to replicate the pressure of playing an away game by making certain gameplay elements more difficult for a short period of time. Lowe's said this draws "meaningful parallels to the passion homeowners feel when enhancing their own spaces with Lowe's."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053" data-ratio="0.56259259259259" data-width="2700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475053"></a><figcaption>A render of the Lowe's interactive gaming experience that's going on a road trip.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4475053-lowes.jpg"></figure><p>In EA Sports FC and Madden NFL, Lowe's branding will show up in the popular Ultimate Team modes.</p><p>The partnership extends to real life as well, as Lowe's is debuting an "On the Road" interactive gaming experience as part of a nationwide tour for the college football and NFL seasons. More details about this are coming later this year.</p><p>Lowe's said the idea with all of this is to help reach people who might be considering a home project and remind them to shop at Lowe's instead of a competitor.</p><p>"This is such an immersive and unexpected way to introduce ourselves to the next generation of home improvers," Lowe's marketing boss Jen Wilson said.</p><p>CFB 26 has big shoes to fill, as 2024's CFB 25 was the year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game in the US</a>, only beaten by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. There was more than a decade of pent-up demand for the game following the last entry in 2013, so it'll be interesting to see how CFB 26 fares by comparison. </p>

for Emma Frost's big gala event. Squirrel Girl also gets a cool punk-themed "Nut Rocker" costume, and Spider-Man has the "Spider-Oni" skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 2 adds a gifting feature to the game. Players can now gift all those fun cosmetics to their friends.</p><p dir="ltr">The big update makes changes for console platforms to include several sensitivity adjustments. These new options should make aiming and movement easier to customize to a player's preference. This includes additional deadzone settings for both triggers and thumbsticks.</p><p dir="ltr">On the PC side, players can now try an "experimental feature" called the Switch Shader Compilation Mode. The developer describes this as a way to potentially make Marvel Rivals run smoother by compiling shaders only when launching Marvel Rivals for the first time after an update to either the game or graphics driver. This is designed to significantly reduce memory usage and minimize in-game stuttering, but the developer warns that additional stutters can happen depending on the power of the player's PC hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">A few map improvements are included for Season 2. This update corrects terrain issues that could previously cause characters to become stuck or clip through odd locations. It also addresses several sound issues on various maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Several hero adjustments are also detailed in the patch notes. This includes Iron Fist's Floating Fumble, which could sometimes cause the hero to end up floating indefinitely. Another fixes Captain America's Shield Bounce, as the hero previously couldn't ricochet enemy projectiles while moving backward. Now, Cap can send projectiles flying no matter which way he is moving.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire list of hero improvements can be found in the patch notes below, as <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250401/41548_1223996.html" rel="nofollow ">shared by the developer</a>.</p><h2>Marvel Rivals Version 20250411 Patch Notes</h2><h2>1.

For example, if you ended Season 1.5 at Diamond I, your Season 2 journey begins at Silver I.</p><p>2. New rank rewards are in! A dazzling new costume for reaching Gold — Emma Frost - Golden Diamond, along with new Crests of Honor for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and Top 500.</p><p>3. The minimum level required for new players to participate in Competitive has been adjusted to 15. (If you have previously completed at least one valid competitive match, you can still join Competitive in Season 2.0 even if you are below level 15.)</p><p>4. Pick/ban will now come into play starting from Gold III rather than Diamond tier.</p><p>5. When a team includes players from Eternity or One Above All, only solo or duo queuing will be allowed.</p><p>6. Currently, the score you earn per Competitive match is determined by both the outcome and your individual performance. After Season 2.0 launches, we will be increasing the weight of individual performances. The better you perform, the more points you will earn in victory, and the fewer points you will lose in defeat.</p><p><strong>Tournament Updates</strong></p><p>1.
