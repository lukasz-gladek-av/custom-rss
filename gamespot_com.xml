                <p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards,</a> Onimusha Way of the Sword is the first new entry in the series since 2006. Capcom revealed the game with a cinematic trailer and confirmed it's coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p><p>The trailer shows a bunch of red flames floating around in different feudal Japanese locations, before being absorbed by the protagonist. There are also a few moments of combat that appear to be in-game, showing off the third-person action against different supernatural monsters, like fungus-infected samurais and giant monsters. A few different big monsters are shown near the end of the trailer, including a large boar looking enemy walking around on two legs.</p><p>Onimusha is historically a hack-and-slash action series, using historical figures to retell parts of Japanese history, with a healthy dose of the supernatural injected, of course. Previous entries were set in the Sengoku period, but Capcom has revealed that Way of the Sword will be set in the early Edo period, taking place in Kyoto. The last mainline entry in the series was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, with only a mobile game and a remaster released since.</p><p>Check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards announcements</a> to see everything revealed during the award show.</p>
