                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> is just days away from launching, and to kick off the next era of the looter-shooter, developer Gearbox has released a new live-action trailer urging people to "quit" Earth and head to Kairos. Sure, Kairos is a planet ruled by an all-powerful dictator who enforces his whims on the population with invasive behavior-altering technology that has a high likelihood of killing you if it's removed, but compared to everything else happening right now--*frantically waves arms*--that's not a dealbreaker.</p><p>The gap between Borderlands 4 being officially announced and its arrival on PC and console has been relatively short. Gearbox first showed off the game--after hinting at it for months--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/">during the 2024 edition of Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, teasing a new world for Vault Hunters to explore and even more loot to grab as they fight against the sinister forces in control of Kairos.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjgWa7cpCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dKjgWa7cpCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The last few months have seen Gearbox reveal a substantial number of details about the game, including detailed looks at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">four Vault Hunters</a> players will have the option of playing as. There's the science-powered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-finally-introduces-harlowe-the-teams-own-mad-scientist/1100-6534213/">Harlowe</a>, walking Tediore weapons advert <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-rafas-violent-past/1100-6533568/">Rafa</a>, not-so-gentle giant <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-amon-and-his-vault-monster-killing-arsenal/1100-6533957/">Amon</a>, and the Siren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailers-introduce-latest-siren-character-show-off-necromancer-abilities/1100-6533123/">Vex</a> for this new adventure.</p><p>Gearbox also recently spoke about the tone of the game, and how the studio strived to create a grounded sense of humor. Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-developers-credit-borderlands-3-dlcs-for-inspiring-the-sequels-tone/1100-6534241/">the Borderlands 3 expansions served as a big source of inspiration</a>. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving in October.</p>
