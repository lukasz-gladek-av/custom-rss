                <p>The Blue Shell is one of the most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-the-agony-and-the-anguish-of-the-blue-shell/1100-6506941/" data-ref-id="1100-6506941">iconic and divisive items</a> in all of Mario Kart, and with the release of Mario Kart World, fans are digging into new intricacies and strategies. It turns out MKW has introduced a new way to avoid the hated item. And unlike many other methods, this one doesn't require you to hold onto a specific item to pull it off.</p><p>Giant Bomb's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lqxay5ct5k2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb noted</a> that you can you can avoid the Blue Shell with a clever use of the new Rewind feature. Your kart simply rewinds a few seconds and the Blue Shell detonates in front of you, with plenty of space for you to swerve around it. That does make it a trade-off, since you'll lose a little ground by rewinding while the other racers will continue on--but it's much less of a penalty than getting hit by the shell, which also makes you lose all your items and momentum.</p><p>In our own testing, we found that you need to carefully time your use of the Rewind, because if you hit it too early, the shell will simply follow you backwards. But if you hit it just as the shell finishes its spin, you'll be safe. Best of all, since the Rewind can be triggered at any time, that gives you evergreen access to a way to avoid the Blue Shell.</p><p>Typically, most ways to avoid the Blue Shell require items, most notably the Super Horn or the Mushroom. This is one of those advanced strategies that should put players on an even playing field, and makes the Blue Shell much less daunting than it has been in the past.</p><p>For more guides on Mario Kart World, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532118/" data-ref-id="1100-6532118">how to unlock Rainbow Road</a>.</p>
