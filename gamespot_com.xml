                <p>Prior to this month, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick assured investors that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was on track for a 2025 debut, while also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">acknowledging the possibility of a delay</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">the game was pushed back to a May 2026 release</a> earlier this month. Now, Zelnick has shared his reaction to GTA 6's delay after offering an explanation.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick noted that GTA 6 needed the extra time for the developers to polish the title and turn it into become the game that fans want it to be.</p><p>"As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear," said Zelnick "In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."</p><p>"While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection," added Zelnick.</p><p>According to <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive's investors info sheet</a>, GTA 6 only entered full development around 2020. The document also stated that, â€œaffording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment," before adding that GTA 6 is now "the most anticipated entertainment property of all time."</p><p>Considering that the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">GTA 6 trailer amassed a half-billion views</a> within the first few days, Take-Two may be right about the game's prerelease demand.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/">PC version is expected to be released at a later date</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Stellar Blade - PC Features And Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>So what's the cause here? That's currently unclear, but this might be a case that's similar to Helldivers 2. Shortly after the game was released on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">it became mandatory for players</a> on that platform to create and link a PlayStation Network account to keep playing the game. There was a huge backlash to this move--that was later scrapped--and Helldivers 2 was subsequently unavailable for purchase because of it in many countries at the time.</p><p>While Stellar Blade doesn't require a PSN account to be playable on PC, one of the new costumes being added to the game can only be unlocked when a Steam account is linked to Sony's service. It's also worth noting that PSN isn't available in the list of countries impacted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254"></a><figcaption>The countries where Stellar Blade won't be sold for PC on Steam (via SteamDB)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg"></figure><p>For everyone else looking to pick up the action game when it arrives next month, Stellar Blade will offer quite a few graphical enhancements. Support for upscaling tech like Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3 will be available, and there'll be lots of new content as well.</p><p>A total of 25 new Nano Suits are being added to the game, and if you feel like testing your skills, you can fight Xionn's guardian Mann in the Boss Challenge mode. PS5 owners can also get this content, as it'll be added to Stellar Blade for free in an upcoming update.</p>

Antireal even<a href="https://x.com/solarphy/status/1923081236567728236" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> confirms</a> that Cross has followed their account "for a few years."</p><p>Bungie responded via its own <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon dev team </a>X account to say that it "immediately investigated" the concerns, and "confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game." It goes on to state that the issue was "unknown" to the existing art team, and it is reviewing how the oversight happened.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213"></a><figcaption>Comparisons between Antireal's art and in-game screenshots from Marathon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>Bungie also says it reached out to Antireal to discuss the matter. "[We] are committed to do right by the artist," it confirms. "As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission." The developer also confirms that to prevent "similar issues" happening again, it will conduct a "thorough review" of game assets, with particular emphasis on the former artist responsible for the issue.</p><p>However, it's not the first time Bungie has been caught using assets without permission, as X user <a href="https://x.com/GaminCounselor/status/1923219998379544675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GaminCounselor</a> points out. In 2021, the Witch Queen DLC trailer featured fan art of Xivu Arath without credit. In 2023, a Destiny 2 cutscene used near-identical fan art without permission. In 2024, the Ace of Spades NERF gun merchandise appeared to copy a fan-created design. In all cases Bungie reached out to the artists to apologize, credit, or compensate them--but four occurrences of art theft in as many years raises questions about Bungie's internal policies when it comes to these matters.</p><p>Bungie plans to host <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marathonthegame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Marathon stream</a> later today (May 16) at 1PM PT / 6PM ET. It's unlikely that it will address the asset theft during the stream, but given the interactive nature of Twitch, viewers may well have comment to pass. Marathon is set for release on September 23, and while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it won't be "full price,"</a> Bungie says it will be "a premium title."</p>
