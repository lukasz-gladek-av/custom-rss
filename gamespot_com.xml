          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>But devoted trainers and soup lovers who collect all eight cans will have a chance to win the grand prize, which, alongside the Switch 2, includes a copy of the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and a limited-edition collectible can. Campbell’s Pokemon Pewter City Special Stew isn't available in stores, and the soup company calls the can a "true collector’s item."</p><p>All you have to do to enter the sweepstakes is collect Pokemon-themed cans of Campbell's soup and submit a photo of yourself and the soup cans on the <a href="https://www.campbells.com/challenge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campbell's website</a>. The sweepstakes begins today and ends on October 31 at  8:59 PM PT / 11:59 PM ET.</p><p>True to Pokemon, some of these themed cans are rare and will be harder to find than others. If you're missing any of the cans, you may have to employ some similar tactics as you would in a Pokémon game, such as trading with friends or searching online. Listings for cans of Pokemon Campbell's soup are already all over eBay.</p><p>For those who want a proper Pokemon experience, Pokemon Legends: Z-A hits stores on October 16. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-reinventing-pokemon-battles-and-i-couldnt-be-more-thrilled/1100-6534964/" data-ref-id="1100-6534964">GameSpot's latest preview</a> of the title says that studio Game Freak "might have pulled it off" with its real-time battle system.</p>

                <p>Frictional Games, the team behind horror hits like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soma-review/1900-6416245/" data-ref-id="1900-6416245">SOMA</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-dark-descent-review/1900-6280302/" data-ref-id="1900-6280302">Amnesia</a>, didn't show up at this year's Horror Game Awards Halloween Showcase, but it's kicking spooky season off right with a brand-new reveal. Working with Kepler Interactive, the studio released a creepy teaser for a new project called Hotel Samsara. The short video features mysterious shots of an eerie, empty hotel, accompanied by strange chanting in the background, ending with a voice saying "something new."</p><p>Along with the teaser, a <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website went live</a> that looks like it's promoting a fancy investment opportunity. It promises a luxury experience and even includes fake reviews. But fans quickly realized this wasn't just a normal game announcement--it was the start of a hidden puzzle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmHnnvQQxaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmHnnvQQxaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3906667/soma-developers-frictional-games-teasing-next-title-with-hotel-samsara-video/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It's been pointed out</a> that one paragraph had certain bolded letters. When put together, the letters spelled out "steganog," which might be short for "steganography"--hiding secret messages inside normal text or images.</p><p>After signing up for email updates, users received strange messages with hidden phrases like "FOLLOWERS OF __." These clues sparked a full-blown mystery, with fans delving into the website, emails, and even old game files to uncover answers. Many believe this new project could be connected to SOMA, or possibly a brand-new horror story.</p><p>As the community solved clue after clue, Frictional Games posted a thank-you message along with the teaser. "We really wanted to try and create something fun to show you a bit of what we've been working on," its said. "What we didn't expect is just how much you would impress us with your ability to all come together as a community and work with each other to solve everything we threw at you." The studio even admitted it had to make the puzzles harder once it saw how quickly fans were solving them.</p><p>Frictional also said how much fun they had watching the community come together--not just to solve puzzles, but also to create jokes, memes, and theories.</p><p>"It's been a pleasure, waking up excited every morning to check the Discord and seeing which rabbit holes you ended up falling into," it continued. While we still don't know exactly what Hotel Samsara is, one thing is clear: Frictional has once again captured fans' attention with their unique mix of mystery, horror, and storytelling. Whether this turns out to be SOMA 2 or something completely new, the hype has already begun.</p>
