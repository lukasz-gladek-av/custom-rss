                <p>Ubisoft has unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-285282">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, and alongside that a new permanent game mode coming to the shooter, Dual Front. Dual Front is a 6v6 game mode featuring respawns, but it still preserves the tactical elements that Siege is known for.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front takes place on a single large map, split into two lanes heading from one team's base to the other. Each lane consists of two sectors, which teams will have to capture one at a time by planting sabotage devices, similar to planting bombs in the main game mode. The two biggest differences here are that each team has six players and that teams will need to manage both attacking the new enemy sector while still defending their own. Teams can split up however they like, and after dying you have a roughly 30-second timer before you can get back in the fight. There is also a neutral zone in the middle where optional objectives, like escorting a hostage to a helicopter, appear, granting a bonus to the team that successfully completes it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873"></a><figcaption>Dual Front takes place in a large industrial area, with smaller areas like a Gas Station making up the sectors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another big difference is the operator pool. There is a limited number of operators in the pool, 35 at launch, which will get rotated on a regular basis. The pool contains both attackers and defenders, which you can pick from freely. This means you can grab a defense-focused operator and go on the attack or vice versa, creating new strategic ways to try and win a match. Matches are expected to take around 20-25 minutes, and there is a timer automatically ending a match at 30 minutes. When Siege X launches, there will be one map featuring symmetrical lanes, but Ubisoft plans on updating and changing the map each season.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front is just one of the many new features coming to Rainbow Six Siege X when it launches on June 10 as part of Y10 S2 of the multiplayer shooter.</p>

Players can expect gameplay balance improvements and equipment adjustments, in addition to a range of bug fixes. The update also adds more country-specific localization, including traditional and simplified Chinese and new French voiceover.</p><p>One of the big additions in the update is the arrival of a barber shop where players can change Henry's bear and hair styles.
