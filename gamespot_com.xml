                <p>The Liberty City Preservation project, a community mod aimed at adapting Grand Theft Auto IV using Grand Theft Auto V's engine, has been taken down. Publisher Take-Two is reportedly behind the decision, and community members apparently shared messages on Discord about the project being canceled.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, one of the project's creators, who goes by the name of nkjellman, broke the news in the mod's Discord server. The message, included below, was also shared by user Yan2295 on <a href="https://x.com/Yan2295/status/1879613877505466546" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), an active member of the GTA community who used to <a href="https://gamerant.com/grand-theft-auto-6-leak-cities/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">share rumors</a> about Rockstar projects.</p><p>"Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project," the screenshot reads. "We appreciate all the support that the project has received, and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."</p><p>The mod presented an ambitious scale, not just in recreating Liberty City with a modern touch thanks to Grand Theft Auto V's engine, but also in aspects like a fully functioning subway. You can see the sequence in action below, courtesy of X user videotechuk_.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1875227187663794525" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Tour around Liberty City using the subway and getting to Middle Park in GTAV<br>Liberty City Preservation Project is the best work in the GTA modding community to date, IMO.

But as it stands, it'll remain as an unfinished community project. The modding team, called World Travel, has yet to reveal what project it's tackling next.</p>

It looks like Donkey Kong's character model in this game was inspired by the character's look in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512972/" data-ref-id="1100-6512972">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>.
