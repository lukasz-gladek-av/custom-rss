                <p>One battle royale after another. After prolific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">crossovers with Superman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, Fortnite appears to be gearing up for a collaboration with the film One Battle After Another. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical. Now it's hard not to imagine characters from Anderson's extensive filmography joining the fray-- picture Barry Egan from Punch-Drunk Love or Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights wielding a pickaxe and running alongside a humanoid fish and a banana with limbs.</p><p>In the meantime, Fortnite studio Epic Games is still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-plan-to-get-fortnite-back-on-ios-has-hit-a-snag-in-the-uk/1100-6533394/" data-ref-id="1100-6533394">get the title playable on iOS in the UK</a>. This comes after an extended legal battle that resulted in Fortnite's return to the US iOS App Store and the Epic Games Store in the EU iOS App Store.</p>

A multiplayer reveal is set for next week, where we'll get a sample of the game's new and returning modes, as well as how Battlefield's iconic classes will look in this new modern skirmish.</p><h2>How to watch the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will be livestreamed on Battlefield's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels. Following the showcase, which will feature developers from Battlefield Studios, viewers will be able to watch press and content creators play the game's new multiplayer suite live.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal start times</h2><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will kickoff at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET on July 31.</p><ul><li>11:30 AM PDT</li><li>2:30 PM EDT</li><li>7:30 PM BST</li><li>4:30 AM AET (August 1)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>EA and Battlefield Studios have claimed that Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will showcase various elements of the multiplayer suite. Specific mention is made of new and returning modes, which lends some credibility to reports of a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">battle royale mode</a> coming to Battlefield for the first time in the franchise's history.</p><p>Besides the aforementioned battle royale mode, it is incredibly likely that the team will be showing off both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-leak-shows-off-rush-mode-and-it-looks-fantastic/1100-6532821/" data-ref-id="1100-6532821">Rush</a> and Conquest, which are arguably Battlefield's signature game modes. The former sees teams planting bombs at pairs of objectives on a small section of a much larger map. The completion of these goals unlocks another set of the map and another pair of bomb sites, until eventually the entire map is unlocked or conversely, the attackers are held off within the time limit.</p><p>Conquest is Battlefield's flagship mode, often touting each respective games' biggest player count, and features warring teams fighting over a series of points of interest in a Domination-like competition. Holding the majority of the points begins to deplete the losing team's respawn counter, which also goes down with every kill.</p><p>Given the emphasis on New York City in the game's initial reveal, a safe assumption would be that the team will show off a multiplayer map taking place there. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-teases-all-out-war-ahead-of-full-reveal/1100-6533382/" data-ref-id="1100-6533382">teaser trailer</a> ahead of the reveal also made mention of Georgia (the country) and Gibraltar, which suggests these could also be maps in the latest game. Expect to see a lot of player destruction of the environments, as well as an emphasis on urban warfare in a deliberate callback to some of Battlefield's most iconic multiplayer arenas.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has also been very open about how it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">tweaking Battlefield's classes</a> following criticism of the last major release in the franchise, Battlefield 2042. That game released with specialists, which were reminiscent of heroes in titles like Overwatch 2, and their implementation proved to be controversial to stalwart Battlefield fans, who felt like the change diluted what they loved about the tactical squad-based gameplay of the series' past. Expect to hear a lot about these changes, as well as other alterations made to character and loadout customization.</p>

<section><p>The idea of a "forever game" is a myth, and game makers should be cognizant of the end of their products.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal." He added: "Support for all games cannot last forever."</p><p dir="ltr">This was in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-addresses-the-stop-killing-games-movement/1100-6533318/">"Stop Killing Games," a consumer movement</a> that rallies against purported "planned obsolescence" of online video games from publishers. Sparked by the shutdown of Ubisoft's The Crew, the movement has gained traction in the past year through petitions directly to European governments.</p><p dir="ltr">From a certain point of view, Guillemot sounds dismissive--like an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/joni-ernst-town-hall-00376747" rel="nofollow ">elected official shrugging off constituent concerns</a> about healthcare coverage by citing the inevitability of mortality. But the limited lifespan of modern live-service games is a reality that publishers and studios never address, at least publicly--or until it's suddenly time to pull the plug. Rarely does an executive acknowledge that their online game will, one day, come to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever a company ships a video game, there's hope from all stakeholders involved that the title will make an impact. Newly shipped online games, in particular, would love to become the "forever game" for as many players as possible--the next Fortnite or Destiny 2. Nowadays, online games are in a relentless and never-ending pursuit of an unknown and unseen finish line. However, as we've seen with the likes of Concord, MultiVersus, XDefiant, and too many others to count, becoming the next Fortnite is an uphill, and perhaps in current market conditions, unfeasible goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft's XDefiant, which shut down in June</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The failures of so many aspiring killers of Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, Destiny, etc., lead me to ponder the "forever games" that continue to thrive. Will we be playing Fortnite Chapter 30 Season 4 in our twilight years from the cloud through data centers on Mars?</p><p dir="ltr">If we all take the "nothing is eternal" comment to heart, Fortnite will not literally last forever. One day, perhaps in the absurdly far future, Epic Games will stop adding new content to Fortnite. Some number of years later, Fortnite will go offline, and the game as we knew it will be dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe companies can stop killing games, but that won't stop games from dying. And the folks who make online games should at least consider how they'll give their games a merciful death when it's time.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo--a company not renowned for its online titles--did something strange before releasing Splatoon 3: it gave the game an endpoint. The shooting game would only get two years of seasonal content, including new maps, weapons, and clothes--though the game would very much remain playable.</p><p dir="ltr">I recall going through all stages of grief while playing Splatoon 3. Having an expiration date for new content was conflicting. At first, playing it felt meaningless; I knew that, despite whatever level of success or popularity it reached, Nintendo was already planning to toss it aside, as it had with Super Mario Maker 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yet, unlike those two other cases, Nintendo was very clear upfront about the level of support Splatoon 3 would receive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5760" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413"></a><figcaption>The Grand Festival event for Splatoon 3, which came at the end of two years of content updates</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From my own experience, those two years with Splatoon 3 were immensely meaningful and special--knowing how long the game would remain fresh made me want to experience as much of that time as possible. And the fact that it got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splatoon-raiders-spin-off-game-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6532308/">Switch 2 update</a> with new weapons, beyond the two-year limit, served as a pleasant surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">But what about a case like Mortal Kombat 1? Upon its release, game director Ed Boon sometimes spoke of <a href="https://x.com/Murdoink/status/1922686641396764849" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"years of content"</a> for the fighting game. So, when the news broke about this "Definitive Edition," which would feature less than two years of content, including 12 new characters and a story expansion, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/">produced outrage from fans</a>. After all, that's about the same amount of new content--and just a few months short--of the amount of support the preceding game, Mortal Kombat 11, received.</p><p dir="ltr">To fans dissatisfied with the state of MK1, this perceived death of the game was premature. It's an example of how the "fairness" of a video game's end-of-life support is ultimately defined by the relationship between the developers' transparency and the consumers' expectations. Maybe NetherRealm Studios wasn't candid enough about the life of MK1, but players might have expected too much--how many more characters did that game need? Still, any imbalance on either side of that developer-player relationship can lead to a PR nightmare.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite video games having more than enough "video game" in it, today's business models have consumers constantly yearning for more. These games need to be constantly supported, improved, and iterated upon; otherwise, they're a "dead game." Yet we also hear cries that online games are becoming too bloated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-many-modern-games-remedy-dev-says/1100-6531538/">rooted in FOMO</a>, and becoming second jobs.</p><p dir="ltr">To escape either of these pitfalls, developers of a live game could make it clear from the start that their service will only have, say, three years of new content. It may sting to hear at first, but I'd argue that it could make those three years impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers can stay focused with a clear goal in mind and move on to the next project afterward. Players can have proper expectations, knowing they have something quantifiable and solid to look forward to without devoting an indefinite amount of time. It's an option that might not make investors happy, but it's not one that companies should count out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2, which launched its latest expansion in July</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There lies the distinction, though, because at least Splatoon 3 and Mortal Kombat 1 are still playable online. Where the more challenging conversations lie is when those online services cease entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">With the total shutdown of a live-service game, especially one like The Crew, in which digital licenses are stripped away, there are legal and financial ramifications--and since the genesis of Stop Killing Games, there has been no shortage of internet debates surrounding them. But from a moral and philosophical standpoint, what does the complete shuttering of a game really mean?</p><p dir="ltr">As simple and true as Guillemot's point might be, it doesn't actually address one of the bigger points from Stop Killing Games, which is preservation and additional end-of-life options. When a video game is completely unplayable in any form, that is certain death.</p><p dir="ltr">The possible solutions for averting demise aren't revelatory: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/">offline modes like with Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> and private server support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-citys-closure-is-part-of-a-painful-truth-of-the-games-industry-studio-says/1100-6511390/">like with Knockout City</a> are viable options. These solutions take time, labor, and devotion to implement, and as developers will tell us, they aren't easy to accomplish.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, the industry must rethink the path it is on where it has trained players into expecting endless content, and any gap or shortcoming spells death. We have to imagine a time when Fortnite concerts will be a thing of the past, and Destiny 2 actually has a final shape. This broader existential issue of end-of-life for video games and how to make it palatable for consumers is something that game makers must consider, and soon. "Forever" is running out.</p>
