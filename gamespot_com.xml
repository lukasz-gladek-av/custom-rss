                <p>One of the original Xbox's designers, Seamus Blackley, said that computing power isn't a helpful selling point anymore when it comes to consoles.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Blackley said that the power-first approach worked for the original Xbox back in 2001 since graphics weren't as polished as they are now. Focusing the narrative on computing power helped the Xbox stand out among Japanese hardware companies.</p><p>"We were a Western company and we were saying 'Okay, weâ€™re going to lose money on these to make them super powerful' and take a bet on the games being awesome," Blackley explained. Back then, the original Xbox was the only console with a built-in hard drive that could handle games like Halo: Combat Evolved, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Fable, and Shenmue 2.</p><p>It was a way for Xbox to get its foot in the door in the video game-console space, but Blackley said had he still been at Microsoft, he wouldn't have continued the power-focused branding for Xbox.</p><p>He also noted reminisced on seeing Gran Turismo for the first time on the original PlayStation, and how he absolutely had to buy it because its graphics were ahead of its time. However, he acknowledged that graphical power hit a plateau and that he doesn't get excited about power anymore.</p><p>Blackley explained that the battle for content has pivoted to where platform-holders need to create compelling experiences. He pointed to the Nintendo Switch, where he said he played through The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild three or four times. The portability factor also granted him long Skyrim sessions on airplane flights.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft have taken note of the Switch's immense success and are reportedly both producing native portable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/" data-ref-id="1100-6528023">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">Xbox systems</a>, respectively.</p><p>Currently, the most powerful console on the market is the PS5 Pro. Despite its hefty $600 price tag, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">Sony said that it did not negatively impact sales</a>. It seems like Xbox boss Phil Spencer echoes Blackley's sentiments, as he said Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-playstation-and-nintendo-console-market-isnt-growing-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527787/" data-ref-id="1100-6527787">isn't planning on releasing a mid-gen</a> refresh like Sony did with the PS5 Pro because an incremental increase in graphical power doesn't provide a unique experience.</p>

                <p>Marvel Rivals has been a big success on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but the game hasn't come to Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon for 2025, some are wondering if the superhero shooter could come to the new Nintendo system, and it doesn't sound too far fetched.</p><p>Producer Weicong Wu told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that NetEase is already speaking with Nintendo and "working on some development kits" for the Switch 2.</p><p>"Whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that," Wu said. "The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that."</p><p>It's quite surprising to hear a developer from such a big company working on a major title like Marvel Rivals speak so openly about the Switch 2. Companies are better known to be much more guarded with information about Nintendo's next console.</p><p>The Switch 2 is coming out this year, with Nintendo expected to share lots more information about the console in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">April during a special Nintendo Direct event.</a> The system, along with the launch of GTA 6, is expected to have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">outsized impact on the overall video game industry in 2025.</a> The Switch 2 was formally confirmed in January 2025, but many remarked that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">the reveal didn't pack a punch. </a></p><p>As for Marvel Rivals, the game's developers recently announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructure its season rankings</a>, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-reworks-its-ranking-system-again-due-to-fan-complaints/1100-6529388/" data-ref-id="1100-6529388">quickly reversed that decision</a>. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with how much they hated it, causing NetEase to backpedal within hours.</p>

The Human Torch will be added as part of the Season 1 mid-season update on February 21, alongside The Thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ORBFXYlQ3U">new trailer</a> shows that Johnny Storm will be primarily a flying character, similar to Iron Man or Storm. His primary fire is a fireball he throws that leaves a small burning area on the ground where it hits. He has six charges, which appear to recharge over time instead of being reloaded. Human Torch can also use a dive attack, which propels him into the ground, dealing damage and knocking enemies back.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another ability the Human Torch has is to create a square of fire, with the borders of the square dealing damage to anyone standing on them or crossing over. His ultimate ability lets him throw out multiple fire tornadoes, which move around after being placed. The trailer also showed his team-up with Storm, which set her ultimate ability--also a tornado--on fire, presumably doing even more damage than usual. Johnny's flying ability and high-damage output is likely to make him a popular pick once he drops.</p><p dir="ltr">The Human Torch joins Marvel Rivals on February 21, alongside the Thing, who should get his own gameplay trailer later this week. All future Marvel Rivals heroes, including Human Torch, are available for free. The mid-season update includes other changes to Marvel Rivals, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-changes-take-aim-at-triple-support-meta/1100-6529553/">nerfs aimed at the triple-support meta</a> and rewards for players with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-now-reward-you-for-leftover-battle-pass-currency/1100-6529551/">leftover battle-pass currency</a> at the end of the season.</p>

                <p>Out of the all the side quests you can embark on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, Forged of the Star-Stuff has the longest, but arguably most rewarding payoff. This quest begins whenever you find a Fragment of Starmetal and requires you to reach the final map of the game to complete it. The Fragments of Starmetal are difficult enough to find, but having to potentially wait dozens of hours to find out what the metal does can be agonizing.</p><p>Fortunately, the quest is worth the wait, as you can score yourself an incredible weapon in Avowed with the Starmetal. The question is, how do you find Fragments of Starmetal and complete the quest?</p><p><strong>Be aware this guide naturally contains some light spoilers.</strong></p><p>First and foremost, once you find a Fragment of Starmetal, the Forged of Star-Stuff quest is automatically triggered in Avowed. You can view the quest in your journal but the game offers nothing in the way of an explanation for what to do with the metal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png"></figure><p>You can find a Fragment of Starmetal as early as Dawnshore, but unfortunately, you have to go through every single map in the game until you can use it. If you speak to certain vendors across the three maps of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp, you can ask about the Starmetal. Specifically, asking blacksmiths about the metal will yield the most answers.</p><p>Regardless of who you speak to about the Starmetal, though, you'll get told the same thing: The Starmetal can only be worked by a smith in Solace Keep. Solace Keep is the main hub city in the final map of Avowed, called Galawain's Tusks. You can only reach this map by progressing through Avowed's main story. So, if you happen to find the Fragment of Starmetal in Dawnshore, you'll have to go through the events of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp before you're finally able to do something with the item.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_into_Solace_Keep_and_complete_Forged_of_Star_Stuff">How to get into Solace Keep and complete Forged of Star-Stuff</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585"></a><figcaption>Talking to Forgemaster Dela in Solace Keep</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png"></figure><p>When you finally reach Galawain's Tusks, you need to travel all the way north to Solace Keep. Solace Keep is extremely well-guarded and doesn't let outsiders in, however, so you have to speak to the guards at the drawbridge before entering the city.</p><p>You are able to persuade the guard to let you in through a few methods. I was able to tell him I got the clear water running by completing an earlier side quest in Galawain's Tusks, but you can also use persuasion checks and certain background dialogue to convince the guard to let you through.</p><p>Once inside Solace Keep, head straight through the mess hall until you reach a pathway that leads downstairs. This goes into the forge, where Foregmaster Dela is standing in front of a statue. Talk to Dela and show him the Starmetal you have in your inventory. He'll start to clamor over the metal and offer to make you a unique weapon from it. You have the choice between a Starmetal Sword or an Arquebus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584"></a><figcaption>The unique Moonstrike arquebus weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png"></figure><p>The unique sword is called Meteor Blade while the unique arquebus is called Moonstrike. Both are fantastic weapons, but the Moonstrike is a little bit better and more useful, in my opinion. However, if you find more Fragments of Starmetal, you can bring them back to Dela and he will make you more weapons with them, allowing you to possess several unique Starmetal weapons. You can also bring more Starmetal to Dela so he can upgrade your existing weapon.</p><p>Forged of Star-Stuff doesn't end until you find the location of every Fragment of Starmetal in Avowed, but once you have one weapon, the quest is essentially completed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png"></figure><p>So far, we know of four different Fragment of Starmetal locations, but there are certainly more on the map that have yet to be discovered. Here are the four locations we know of:</p><ul><li><strong>Galawain's Tusks</strong>: Right beside the Ash Forest in a meteor pit where the Revenant bounty is located (northwest of Solace Keep)</li><li><strong>Dawnshore</strong>: At the Godless Altar directly south of the gate to Emerald Stair on the eastern side of the map</li><li><strong>Shatterscarp</strong>: In the Abandoned Mines directly across from Ruanga's house (seen during the One Last Drink side quest)</li><li><strong>Emerald Stair</strong>: Right underneath the Damp Burrow text in the northern part of Emerald Stair on a rock (to the east of the Abandoned Farms and Rolling Crags)</li></ul><p>We'll update this guide with more fragment locations if they are discovered. All you really need is one to complete the Forged of Star-Stuff quest in Avowed, but like we said, a few more overpowered weapons surely don't hurt, right? Well, they don't hurt <em>you</em>, anyway.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

Sanza is missing one last cartographer somewhere in the fiery region and it's your job to find out where they are. Unlike the other cartographers in Mapping the Living Lands, however, the one in Galawain's Tusks is alive and well, and you have a decision to make regarding their fate.</p><p>To see where the Galawain's Tusks cartographer is located in Avowed and how to finally complete Mapping the Living Lands, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Cartographer location in Avowed</h2><p>Unfortunately, the cartographer in Galawain's Tusks is just about as far as possible from the starting position in the region. You have to travel all the way north to Solace Keep and then find a jail tower where the cartographer is being held prisoner. This jail tower is called "Soreena's Mercy" and it's located to the northwest of Solace Keep.</p><p>You don't have to enter Solace Keep or complete any additional story missions in Avowed to reach the cartographer. You don't even have to actively track the new Mapping the Living Lands quest.

At the very end of the prison cells, you'll see an NPC standing outside of one of the cells. There's a person inside named Renato, who you can speak to through the cell.</p><p>Renato is Sanza's missing cartographer, and he was arrested by the Wardens at Solace Keep for stealing supplies so he could stay alive to complete his mission for Sanza. As you continue speaking with him, you'll be able to make a choice regarding his fate. You can either convince the Warden to release Renato, which isn't too difficult, or you can say you're going to take his map and leave him to rot in the cell for his crimes. The alternative is to fight the Warden and free Renato yourself, but that's mostly unnecessary unless you're playing a more aggressive character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558"></a><figcaption>Choosing to free Renato or leave him in the cell. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png"></figure><p>If you choose to free Renato, he will end up giving you his cartography map anyway. If you take his map and make him stay in the cell, the outcome is the same, as you can take the map back to Sanza in Paradis to complete the Mapping the Living Lands quest. This is the last of these quests in Avowed, so if you've completed the other three regions, you're officially done with this questline.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

The mid-season update will also add The Thing and Human Torch, along with a new map and balance update.</p><p dir="ltr">Shared in the <a href="https://youtu.be/FMPCzylKgc8?si=jxolri2w_qBGMha6&amp;t=189" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision</a>, leftover Chrono Tokens, the battle-pass currency, will be exchanged for Units, an in-game currency used to buy cosmetics from the store, like hero skins. While the exact ratio wasn't revealed in the video, this exchange will be available to players who have purchased the premium version of the battle pass and redeemed all of the rewards in the battle pass. If you meet those two requirements by the end of the season, whatever tokens you have left will be exchanged at whatever the ratio is. It wasn't stated if the ratio will be revealed along with the patch notes for the mid-season update, or if it will be revealed towards the end of Season 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FMPCzylKgc8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Tokens are earned exclusively from challenges--daily, season, or event--so players cannot earn them endlessly. However, in Season 0 there were certainly far more tokens that could be earned than needed to unlock every item in the battle pass, and the Season 1 battle pass is tracking to be similar. Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so this exchange offers a reward for players who finish a battle pass within the same season it's released.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update drops on Friday, February 21, bringing a new Duelist and Vanguard to the roster, along with a new map and balance updates, like some much needed nerfs for certain Strategist ultimates.</p>
