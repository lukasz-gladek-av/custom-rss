available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_will_be_on_Game_Pass">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be on Game Pass</h2><p>Microsoft owns Activision and the Pro Skater series as part of its buyout of Activision Blizzard, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available at launch on Game Pass. You will need to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass to play the game at launch.</p><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_skaters">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 skaters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455171-thps-doom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455171" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455171-thps-doom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455171"></a><figcaption>Yes, THAT Doom Slayer is in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455171-thps-doom.jpg"></figure><p>Alongside the Hawkman himself, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will feature many of the original skaters from those two games, several new faces, and a few interesting editions from id Software's Doom series of first-person shooters. Interestingly, Jackass star Bam Margera isn't on the list and is nowhere to be seen in the debut trailer. While Activision did mention that it has more secret skaters to reveal, it looks like Margera has seemingly been cut from the roster.</p><p>While Margera found success after Jackass with skateboarding deals and the MTV series Viva La Bam, recent years have seen him deal with substance abuse and health issues. Jackass director Jeff Tremaine had originally planned to include him in the fourth film, but Margera was fired from the project and a restraining order was issued against him by the filmmaker.</p><p>The classic THPS games also featured several memorable guest characters, and while we're not certain if Darth Maul, Marvel's Wolverine, or if Officer Dick will show up, we do know that the Doom Slayer will be in the game as a digital deluxe and collector's edition bonus. An interesting fact here is that Doom Guy was originally in THPS 3's PC edition, so this is a nice bit of continuity for the remake.</p><p>Here's the full list so far of skaters in the game:</p><h3 id="Returning_skaters">Returning skaters</h3><ul><li>Tony Hawk</li><li>Bob Burnquist</li><li>Steve Caballero</li><li>Kareem Campbell</li><li>Rune Glifberg</li><li>Eric Koston</li><li>Bucky Lasek</li><li>Rodney Mullen</li><li>Chad Muska</li><li>Andrew Reynolds</li><li>Geoff Rowley</li><li>Elissa Steamer</li><li>Jamie Thomas</li></ul><h3 id="New_skaters">New skaters</h3><ul><li>Chloe Covell</li><li>Jamie Foy</li><li>Rayssa Leal</li><li>Yuto Horigome</li><li>Zion Wright</li><li>Wireframe Tony Hawk (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li><li>Doom Slayer (Preorder (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li><li>Revenant (via the digital deluxe and collector's editions)</li></ul><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_gameplay">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455172" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455172"></a><figcaption>The Hawkman returns.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455172-thps34%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The interesting thing about these two THPS games is that they represent two very different eras for the franchise. THPS 3 was the final game for several years to use the traditional two-minute time-limit for each stage, while THPS 4 scrapped the timer and gave players the option to explore each stage at their own leisure during career mode. For Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-4s-remake-isnt-just-limited-to-two-minute-levels/1100-6529951/">Iron Galaxy is unifying the experience</a> by keeping the time-limit structure intact for both games. It has been suggested that certain objectives have been reworked for THPS4, to accommodate this change.</p><p>Regardless, you'll still be able to play through these games at a leisurely pace through Free Skate mode, and there'll also be Speed Run and Single Session modes to try out.</p><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_skate_parks">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 skate parks</h2><p>Just like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2, all the locations from the THPS 3 and 4 will be making a return in this remake. The reveal trailer was mostly focused on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 with quick peaks at the Airport, Rio, and Los Angeles maps, but we also got a glimpse at the College and Alcatraz skate parks from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. Developer Iron Giant has also teased Waterpark, one of three new locations that'll be in the game.</p><ul><li>Airport (THPS 3)</li><li>Alcatraz (THPS 4)</li><li>Canada (THPS 3)</li><li>College (THPS 4)</li><li>Foundry (THPS 3)</li><li>Rio (THPS 3)</li><li>San Francisco (THPS 3)</li><li>Tokyo (THPS 3)</li><li>Waterpark</li></ul><h2 id="Tony_Hawk_s_Pro_Skater_3___4_soundtrack">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455173-thps34%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455173" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455173-thps34%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455173"></a><figcaption>Nothing beats nailing a cool trick while listening to Ace of Spades.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4455173-thps34%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 saw the licensed soundtrack expand across multiple genres, and while we don't have the full mixtape yet, it sounds like the soundtrack will see the return of several bangers from yesteryear.

                <p>Leaked gameplay footage of the next, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">still-untitled Battlefield game</a> is making its way online, giving fans a glimpse at what the future of the franchise will entail.</p><p dir="ltr">A small number of players are currently playing the next installment in the Battlefield franchise as part of an early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-battlefield-labs-test-begins-this-week-report/1100-6529917/" data-ref-id="1100-6529917">Battlefield Labs playtest</a>, and though those playing are under an NDA, gameplay footage has unsurprisingly leaked online. Publisher EA, at least initially, seemed to be pulling down leaked footage of the playtest, but many clips continue to circulate online for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/" data-ref-id="1100-6526539">large scale playtest</a> being described as existing so that players can give feedback on a pre-alpha version of the game, the new Battlefield looks to be fairly far along. This new entry takes place in the modern day rather than in the past (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-1/" data-ref-id="5000-454570">Battlefield 1</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-v/" data-ref-id="5000-482208">Battlefield V</a>) or the future (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>), bringing to mind the look and feel of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-4/" data-ref-id="5000-147664">4</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaked footage shows the classic Battlefield game mode Conquest being played on an urban map named Abbasid. The UI looks similar to that of Battlefield 2042, but also features a return to the franchise's tried-and-true class system, with players able to choose between Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon.</p><p dir="ltr">Destruction looks to be back in a big way as well. Footage shows more detailed environmental destruction than in Battlefield 2042, with a single rocket able to completely decimate a building as upper floors collapse onto themselves. While Battlefield 2042 did feature destruction (a series staple), it was more limited, with many of the game's buildings unable to be collapsed.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all to say it's about what you would expect from a Battlefield set in the modern day. Movement looks to be slower compared to something like Call of Duty or even previous Battlefield games, though that is something that could definitely be tweaked from the playtest to the full version of the game. There's also a fair number of visual bugs (flickering and debris floating in the air), but as this is an early test, much of that is to be expected.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1897938457378291779" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, the official Battlefield account outlined some of the key features being tested as part of this first Battlefield Labs playtest, namely gunplay and movement. The new Battlefield's servers will feature 60Hz tick rates to ensure the game "more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players," and will display bullets faster after pressing fire to "decrease input delay, make shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets." The article continues to state that the developers have adjusted the recoil of the game's weapons to all "feel unique" when firing them, and that weapons "visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you're actually firing and controlling it."</p><p dir="ltr">As for movement, the new Battlefield is bringing back the ability to crouch sprint (previously featured in Battlefield V), as well as perform combat dives and rolls. According to the article, updates have also been made to the game's visual indicators to make it easier to know when it's possible to vault over something or lean around cover.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Battlefield X account gave the disclaimer that some features seen in the Battlefield Labs playtest are placeholder and work-in-progress, with bugs and performance not being representative of the final game.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Battlefield general manager Byron Beede said the team put a focus on "finding the fun" for the next entry through rapid prototyping and early player feedback. Four different studios are currently contributing to the next Battlefield, with what Beede described as the "largest, strongest, most focused team" in the franchise's history. Battlefield creator DICE is handling the game's signature multiplayer alongside help from Criterion, while Criterion is additionally making the game's single-player campaign alongside Motive. A fourth studio, Ripple Effect, is working on a mysterious "new Battlefield experience," having previously built <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-portal-how-battlefield-2042s-custom-mode-creator-works/1100-6497921/" data-ref-id="1100-6497921">Battlefield 2042's Portal mode</a>. That mode, which allowed players to create custom game types and play with weapons and on maps from older Battlefield entries, is rumored to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-reportedly-bringing-back-the-portal-platform-from-2042/1100-6529232/" data-ref-id="1100-6529232">returning for the unofficially titled Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Battlefield does not currently have an exact release date, but according to a recent EA quarterly earnings report, it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">arrive by March 2026</a>.

When bored aliens transform Earth into a giant video-game style dungeon, Coast Guard veteran Carl becomes a participant in a life-or-death tournament. Carl is accompanied by a cat named Princess Donut. Throughout the series, the duo squares off against a wide array of monsters and solves puzzles. In case the name Princess Donut didn't give it away, Dungeon Crawler Carl doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the high stakes, the series frequently leans into the ridiculousness of the scenario with darkly humorous dialogue and over-the-top violence.</p><p>You can start your journey with Carl and Princess Donut by picking up the hardcover edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeon Crawler Carl (Book 1)</a> for $20.30 (was $30) at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">The upcoming hardcover editions follow the same release schedule as the first three novels: Ace is publishing one hardcover per month for the next three months. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593955978?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book 4)</a></strong> releases March 11 and is available to preorder for $25 (was $30) at Amazon. You can save even more on Book 5, as preorders for <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593955994?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Butcher's Masquerade</a></strong> are discounted to $20.49 (was $35) ahead of its April 8 release. Book 6, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059395601X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Eye of the Bedlam Bride</a></strong>, will be published in hardcover on May 13, and preorders are up for grabs for $34 (was $39).</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering why the retail prices are higher for later books in the series, it's likely related to page count. Books 1 and 2 were 464 and 384 pages, respectively, whereas Book 5 is 720 pages and Book 6 is the longest book in the series at 832 pages.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the cover art for all six hardcover editions below.
