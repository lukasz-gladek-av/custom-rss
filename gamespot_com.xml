                <p>In 2015, developers Pilgrim Adventures and GrabTheGames Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-deed/" data-ref-id="5000-450997">The Deed</a>, an adventure-RPG that upended the traditional structure of mystery stories. This week, The Deed is available on Steam for free for a limited time, but only if you grab it quickly.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2P0BdvGoUo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2P0BdvGoUo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From now until Saturday, September 27 at 10 am, The Deed is free to all users on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/The_Deed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The best way to describe the premise is to invoke the board game Clue. Except this time, you're not out to find the killer because your character is the murderer, and the goal of the game is to get away with the crime. </p><p>Players assume control of Arran Bruce, a man who believes that he's the rightful heir to his family's ancestral home, Dunshiel House. Arran's father disagrees, and has cut him out of the will in favor of Arran's younger sister. For Arran, the solution is simple: His sister needs to die. How she dies is up to you as the player. </p><p>There are ten possible murder weapons, including a rope, a candlestick, and rat poison. Your weapon of choice also informs your decision about who to frame for the crime. Household servants and other members of Arran's family could be the prime suspects, if you play cards right and convincingly leave enough evidence. </p><p>Once Arran's sister is dead and a fall guy or girl is selected, there's one last task. The police send an inspector to investigate the crime and interrogate Arran. If players can't keep their stories together, they might be Columbo-ed and wind up in prison. There are multiple endings and not all of them positive for Arran. </p><p>While The Deed is only available for free this week, GameSpot has assembled our picks for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">the best free Steam games</a>, which you can grab right now.</p>

                <p>Last Year, Pacific Drive took players to an alternate version of the Pacific Northwest filled with bizarre horrors. The indie survival game was one of our favorite releases of the year, and soon it's getting a big new expansion, Whisper in the Woods, later in 2025. Even better, you'll be able to add a new physical edition of the game to your collection when the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRRN2T1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pacific Drive: Ritual Edition</a> launches for PS5 later this year.

This comes with the base game, an in-game cosmetic pack, a reversible cover, three physical art cards, and a traveler’s journal. It’s currently on sale for $36 (was $40), making it a nice alternative to the upcoming steelbook of the Ritual Edition. Meanwhile, PC players can grab the Steam version at a discount via Fanatical, where the standard edition is currently on sale for $13.64 (was $30) or the Deluxe Edition for $16 (was $35).</p><h2>Pacific Drive Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Preorders+For+The+New+Pacific+Drive%3A+Ritual+Edition+Are+Live+At+Amazon&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-25+16%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-25+16%3A33%3A04&amp;fnarticle_id=6534904&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fpacific-drive&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorders-for-the-new-pacific-drive-ritual-edition-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6534904%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pacific Drive standard edition (PC)</a> -- $13.64 ($30)</li><li><strong>Pacific Drive: Deluxe Edition</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Drive-Deluxe-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CNVGGZRL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $36 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Preorders+For+The+New+Pacific+Drive%3A+Ritual+Edition+Are+Live+At+Amazon&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-09-25+16%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-25+16%3A33%3A04&amp;fnarticle_id=6534904&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fpacific-drive-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorders-for-the-new-pacific-drive-ritual-edition-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6534904%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC</a> -- $16 (<del>$35</del>)</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRRN2T1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pacific Drive: Ritual Edition (PS5)</a> -- $60 | Release TBA</li></ul><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pacific-drive-review-road-trippy/1900-6418183/" data-ref-id="1900-6418183">Pacific Drive review</a> gave it a strong 8/10, highlighting its powerful upgrade system, unsettling version of the Pacific Northwest, and a excellent soundtrack featuring artists from the region. “Rarely does a video game make driving as engaging and enjoyable as Pacific Drive does, even though it can be much more challenging than any real-life drive I've ever taken,” wrote critic Mark Delaney. “With a ton of gameplay depth, an intoxicating atmosphere, and a New Weird story I obsessed over, the debut game from Ironwood Studios dazzled me even though it occasionally left me stranded in the breakdown lane.”</p><p>Looking for other Amazon exclusives? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Limited-Exclusive-PlayStation/dp/B0D187PJHJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws: Limited Edition</a> comes with a cool Rogue Infiltrator Character Pack featuring cosmetics for its main characters, and it’s currently discounted to $30 (was $53).

This set is called Deluxe Pack ex, and it guarantees at least one rare card in every pack. However, unlike previous expansions, it will only be available for a limited time.</p><p>According to the official <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon website</a>, every Deluxe Pack ex pack will include "one card with a rarity of ♦♦♦♦ or higher from previous expansions, from Genetic Apex to Wisdom of Sea and Sky." Moreover, the expansion will introduce "parallel foil" cards that boast a special shine effect, as well as older cards with new artwork. You can take a look at some of the cards in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmdrQkRfUBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hmdrQkRfUBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As mentioned, unlike previous Pokemon TCG Pocket expansions, the Deluxe Pack ex set will only be available through October 29, giving you a month to take advantage of the improved rates and fill out your card collection. However, the game has a few events lined up for that time period, including a Raichu ex drop event and a special Bonus Week event.</p><p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has been introducing new expansions on a monthly basis since the game officially launched last October.
