                <p>It's no secret that a video game based on 2008's The Dark Knight was in development at one point, before the plug was ultimately pulled. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-footage-for-batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-surfaces-online/1100-6522392/">Footage of the game</a>--which was being developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">by the now-shuttered Monolith Productions</a>--has surfaced online over the years, and this week, a new video showed how this Batman adventure would have taken a cue from the live-action films with its dynamic soundtrack.</p><p>As part of a treasure trove of materials uncovered by retro games enthusiast and archivist Mar Talida, the footage showcases early cinematic footage, game design documents, concept art, and much more. If you have an ear for video game soundtracks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbadrp5ek2v" rel="nofollow ">there's even video of the game's dynamic audio system</a> and how it would change depending on the situation that players found themselves in. Batman live-action films have had iconic soundtracks, and Monolith's game used some of Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight soundtrack to demonstrate this feature.</p><p>It's worth noting that all of this content came from very early in the pre-production of the Batman game--codenamed Project Apollo--as the assets were dated to around 2009-2010 and naturally look rougher than the 2024 leak.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcba4da5xk2x" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiexnglfrkoagem3zaekq35capabq2ux3cwacqlek5gdc2hwzn35la" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>I've recovered a cache of documents and videos from the pre-production phase of Project Apollo, a canceled Batman game Monolith worked on for Warner Bros.

  </div><p>While the project was eventually scrapped and elements of it were used to develop Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its signature Nemesis System, Batman fans weren't left out in the cold thanks to Rocksteady's popular Arkham series of games. Since then, things have changed drastically at publisher Warner Bros. Games, as it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-game-publisher-undergoes-major-shakeup/1100-6532546/">weathered major organizational </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-game-publisher-undergoes-major-shakeup/1100-6532546/">shifts</a> and could soon have a new owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-bid-for-warner-bros-now-looks-more-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6537239/" data-ref-id="1100-6537239">in the form of Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paramount-not-giving-up-on-buying-warner-bros-launches-lawsuit/1100-6537335/" data-ref-id="1100-6537335">Paramount</a>. Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>, and DC studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a> in the future.</p><p>Fortunately, Batman returns later this year in Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The new Lego game looks like it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-isnt-just-another-lego-game/1100-6534151/">taking a few pages out of the Arkham playbook</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-releases-in-may/1100-6536781/">and it'll be released on May 29</a> for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date.</p>

                <p>When single developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone officially released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> in 2016, the farm-life sim wasn't intended to have any voiceovers. That hasn't stopped a dedicated fan from creating a Stardew Valley mod that adds vocal performances to the game.</p><p>Voice actress and software engineer Shannon Hobby released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22550?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Stardew Valley voice over mod</a> as a proof of concept in 2024. But this week, Hobby has updated the mod with vocal performances for all of the romanceable characters in the game. Hobby's intent is give every character in the game a voice, but it's still a work in progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1f9o67Y5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z1f9o67Y5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm a voice actor and software engineer and I've combine these skills to make something wonderful for a game that I really care about that's super important to me and I know is important to a lot of people," said Hobby in her initial announcement video. "I think this was a perfect opportunity to combine those skill sets and make something that I'm proud of for a game that I really care about and give back to the community a little bit."</p><p>Hobby went on to explain that she is not using generative AI for the game's voices. Instead, all of the voices are provided by real people whom Hobby has paid out of her own pocket. She also shared the cast list below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JanFuzzball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Michelle</a> as Emily</li><li><a href="https://heiditabing.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heidi Tabing</a> as Penny</li><li><a href="https://thatdamvoice.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Meyers</a> as Sebastian</li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/@saiyanserenityv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemi Haydee Stanton</a> as Haley</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aiden_dawn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aiden Dawn</a> as Leah</li><li><a href="http://www.eamonkinsmanvo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eamon Kinsman</a> as Alex</li><li><a href="https://x.com/hopkinsjacob5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jacob Hopkins</a> as Sam</li><li><a href="https://www.gmhakim.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GM Hakim</a> as Harvey</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/TPOTcos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nia Celeste</a> as Maru</li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/animenji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmanuel "Menji" Menjivar</a> as Elliott</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DianaJurand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Jurand</a> as Abigail</li><li>Jonathan David Bullock as Shane</li></ul><p>Audio Editing Assistance was provided by Victoria Cheng.

That update doesn't currently have a release date, but Barone has warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-1-7-update-is-going-to-take-a-while-before-it-releases/1100-6534909/">it's going to take "a while."</a></p>

                <p>How expensive can a game be while still feeling like you're only dropping five bucks on it? According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> co-creator Nick Kaman, $8 is the ideal price point for a $5 game.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Nick Kaman explained that the team had a $5 "joke" that actually ended up informing Peak's standard pricing. "We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?" he said. "In a player's mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that's still five bucks."</p>

<p>"Four bucks is also kind of five bucks. Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free," Kaman continued. "So we've got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks... that's ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn't become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal."</p><p>This "eight bucks is five bucks" joke originated in conversations between developers at Landfall and Aggro Crab, when developers from both studios were working together to create Peak. While Peak originally launched at a reduced price of $5, its standard price is $8, or more specifically $7.99, based on the pricing of Landfall's indie horror hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/content-warning/" data-ref-id="5000-624337">Content Warning</a>.</p><p>Even though Kaman's whole joke is kind of confusing and hard to follow, psychological pricing is a very real science in the business world, and the strategy seems to have paid off for Peak. The offbeat co-operative climbing game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">third best-selling game on Steam</a> over the holiday season, moving almost 800,000 copies in just two weeks.</p><p>Peak is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for $4.95--basically $5--which is the cheapest price the indie hit has sold for since it released in June.</p>
