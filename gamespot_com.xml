                <p>According to one analyst, Call of Duty as a franchise is "underperforming" in 2025 due to a variety of factors. Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said in an interview that some of the factors that he believes are contributing to Call of Duty's decline include "community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition."</p><p>In terms of the competition, Elliott called out Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, along with Fortnite, which recently had a popular Simpsons season and launched its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">positively received Chapter 7.</a></p><p>"Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elliott told Eurogamer</a>. "Attention is scarce."</p><p>Elliott went on to say that players are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Call of Duty's "lack of innovation." Prior to Black Ops 7's release, Elliott said people would buy Black Ops 7 even if they complained about a lack of innovation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">because many people buy new Call of Duty games yearly as part of "autopilot" purchasing.</a> Elliott also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">predicted that Black Ops 7 would outsell Battlefield 6</a>, but he made this prediction prior to the release of both games.</p><p>Elliott also pointed out that Call of Duty's turn toward more "Fortnite-like cosmetics" and "non-military character skins" like Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj has "alienated a significant portion of the fanbase who prefer a more grounded military aesthetic."</p><p>For what it's worth, Black Ops 7 does not feature the same kind of wacky and over-the-top skins that Black Ops 6 had, in part because Activision said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/" data-ref-id="1100-6534614">heard the concerns that Call of Duty had strayed from its identity</a>. Warzone, however, still has all of those kinds of skins.</p><p>For Black Ops 7 specifically, Elliott said the game's co-op campaign was a "major point of criticism," while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">the game's use of "AI slop"</a> was a sore spot for some.</p><p>"Player reception was [also] largely negative, with a mostly negative Steam user score and review bombing galore. Long-standing player frustrations, like the perceived impact of skill-based matchmaking--and the focus on heavy microtransactions (skins and bundles) over core gameplay quality, continue to drive players away from the franchise," he added.</p><p>Additionally, Elliott said Black Ops 7 launching into Game Pass "cannibalized traditional full-price game sales" for Xbox and PC. He pointed to the reporting that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">Black Ops 6 missed out on $300 million in potential sales</a> due to the game being on Game Pass.</p><p>"Our estimates have signaled time and time again that Game Pass cannibalizes game revenues--and Call of Duty is no different," he said.</p><p>Beyond all of this, Elliott said the marketing for Black Ops 7 was "pretty abysmal and underwhelming," while the game's formal reveal event at Call of Duty Next was "messy and did little to excite the community."</p><p>"This is again in stark contrast to the community-driven, focused marketing of Battlefield and Arc, whose development and marketing has been incredibly community-driven," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">sold more than 10 million copies</a>, reportedly, but there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-reported-black-ops-7-regional-sales-numbers-are-unimpressive/1100-6536468/" data-ref-id="1100-6536468">no sales data available yet for Black Ops 7</a>. Any comparison would be incomplete and unfair, as Black Ops 7 is on Game Pass and is available on more platforms than Battlefield 6. No shooter has outsold Call of Duty in terms of full-year in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">since 2006</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">Battlefield 6 has already eclipsed the first-month sales of Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3.</a></p>

                <p>Late last month, Santa Ragione, the developer behind the indie horror game Horses, revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> while the game was still in development. The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well.</p><p>Santa Ragione shared <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy statement on its site</a>, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store.</p><p>In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game.</p><p>"We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels, stating clearly that the game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," reads the statement from Santa Ragione. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera. And finally, we explained that the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general."</p><p>Although Santa Ragione was given an opportunity to appeal, the judgment was quickly upheld and now the game is banned from the two biggest PC storefronts... and possibly a third as well. Horses had been set to be released on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store</a>, but the listing now redirects away from the game's page and it doesn't appear to be listed on that site any longer. GameSpot has reached out to Humble for comment.</p><p>Santa Ragione previously disclosed that it invested $100,000 in the development of Horses, and that it may close as a result of being locked out of Steam. Getting banned from Epic may have made the studio's situation even more difficult. Regardless, Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>. And while it's not an adults-only game, some aspects of it are very disturbing. The horses at the center of the game aren't really horses at all. They're people who have been forced to wear horse masks and live like a horse.</p>
