                <p>This year's first <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> (AGDQ) charity livestream has shown players a side of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> that they may not have been aware of before. Free Roam mode lets fans explore the open world of the game, but someone at AGDQ has demonstrated how to turn that into your personal playground.</p><p>A speedrunner named Helix went through Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode to complete the All ? Panels category in under 30 minutes. The goal is to activate every single question mark block in the game. To pull that off, Helix needed to pull off a lot of tricks, as well as some lucky breaks, and judicious use of the game's rewind feature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ATxMOTKWzg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ATxMOTKWzg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Helix clearly has a mastery of Mario Kart World's open world, as some of the question marks aren't easily accessible without knowing where they are or how to reach them with your chosen character. For this speedrun, Helix went with Para-Biddybud because his light weight and ability to stay in the air longer than most of the other racers. Helix also explained that this is best attempted with a fresh save file, or else Free Roam mode will drop players near the last course they completed.</p><p>Earlier this week at AGDQ, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> content creator DThaiPome <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-dressed-up-as-pac-man-to-play-pac-man-during-agdq-livestream/1100-6537187/" data-ref-id="1100-6537187">came dressed up as Pac-Man</a> to perform a speedrun of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3987">Pac-Man World 2</a> in about 30 minutes. AGDQ will continue until Sunday, January 11 and the proceeds of this week's event go to <a href="https://preventcancer.org/about-us/vision-mission-and-goals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>.</p><p>Some Nintendo fans recently came to the conclusion that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-nintendo-fans-think-that-mario-kart-world-dlc-news-is-incoming/1100-6536722/" data-ref-id="1100-6536722">Mario Kart World DLC news is immanent</a>, but that has yet to be confirmed by Nintendo itself. Nintendo has revealed that it will be phasing out the Mario Kart World Switch 2 bundle.</p>
