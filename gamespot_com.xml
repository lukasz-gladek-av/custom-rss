Multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kwee87/gearing_up/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">images</a> and videos (some of which were pulled as this article was written) circulating online show what appear to be Switch 2 systems in stores and even potentially already at home with some users.</p><p>But the systems may nothing more than paperweights for now, as the Switch 2 is said to be unable to be used without a day-one mandatory online update. That might mean that anything more than further impressions of what it's like to hold the unit will have to wait until launch day. You can read our initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">hands-on impressions with Switch 2</a> for some sense of what to expect. </p><p>We can't say for sure if any of the leaks thus far are legitimate. It's a certainty that Nintendo is shipping units to stores ahead of the June 5 launch, so it's possible that some legitimate footage is emerging and that people may have already gotten their hands on a unit.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A source told Wario64</a> that they obtained a Switch 2 console and tried to boot it up. However, the console reportedly returned the message, "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p><p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> reported that there will be a "significant" day one patch for the Switch 2. Exactly what's included in the update, however, is unknown.</p><p>The Switch 2 officially launches on June 5, with Mario Kart World as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch title</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: Mists of Pandaria Classic will launch July 21, Blizzard has announced, and there will be a new way to get brought up to speed for those who haven't played some of the game's previous Classic expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has long sold WoW character boosts, and in WoW Classic, started selling them ahead of the arrival of The Burning Crusade Classic. The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>. While still featuring modern WoW's gameplay, the event saw players make new characters and speedrun through Mists of Pandaria content with faster leveling speeds, powerful gems that triggered additional effects in combat, and new limited-time rewards like mounts and armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">WoW's next remix event will be for the popular Legion expansion</a> later this year. Meanwhile, WoW's long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing system</a> is still on track to arrive as part of its Midnight expansion. During a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a>, we said the possibilities for housing customization already feel endless.</p>

                <p>It's a big day for Ubisoft's The Division 2, as the game has joined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> library alongside the debut of its new expansion, Battle for Brooklyn.</p><p>The Division 2 is available via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. People who subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate get a perk in the form of the free EMS outfit, which itself includes five EMS-themed items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S65EIG8H3Z4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S65EIG8H3Z4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Division 2 comes to Game Pass just as the game's seventh year of live service begins with the Year 7 Crossroads update. This season is all about nostalgia, with new modifiers and gear that are callbacks to the original The Division, Ubisoft said. Year 7 also includes a range of quality-of-life improvements, including better onboarding for new players.</p><p>The Division 2 is also included in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/" data-ref-id="1100-6531805">PlayStation Plus Extra catalog</a>, while Ubisoft+ subscribers can get it through their membership as well.</p><p>Additionally, the Battle for Brooklyn expansion is out now, taking players to Brooklyn as part of a "brand-new linear campaign." The campaign can be completed solo or in co-op, and the story involves learning how the Cleaners have cooked up their dangerous Purple Flame weapon.</p><p>Everyone who buys the $15 Battle for Brooklyn expansion gets an automatic level-40 boost, along with the DLC-exclusive Catalyst Exotic mask that provides special in-game bonuses. Battle for Brooklyn is also included in The Division 2's Gold and Ultimate editions.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year.</p>
