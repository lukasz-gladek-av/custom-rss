Moving around hub areas like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds is now smoother, and the visuals overall are more detailed.

We also made it easier for other special weapons to fight against the Crab Tank.</p><p>For Toxic Mist, we have reduced the amount of ink consumed to make it easier to fight in combination with main weapons. On the other hand, we have simultaneously extended the time before ink begins to recover so that this change does not lead to tactics where players simply continuously throw their sub weapons.</p><p>The next update will focus on multiplayer balance based on analysis of changes to the situation that come with these weapon additions.</p><hr>

Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> winning several game of the year awards 10 years earlier, The Veilguard simply wasn't as well-received among fans. Now, a new report is shedding light on The Veilguard's troubled development and why it failed.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has offered a comprehensive look back at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but perhaps the most surprising thing is how much of the story was already known. One of the most common refrains in the report is that BioWare was hamstrung by the initial plans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">to make The Veilguard a live-service title</a>. Even switching back to a single-player game didn't allow the team to recapture the fully-realized stories and options that the previous titles had.</p><p>The report also appears to confirm the account of former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider, who previously spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams</a> at BioWare. Even when the two teams were brought together for The Veilguard, the tribalism remained.</p><p>"As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings," states the report. Bloomberg also notes that the Dragon Age team was infuriated when the Mass Effect team were allowed to make "big, ambitious swings," while the former was told there wasn't the budget or time to do so.</p><p>"It always seemed that, when the Mass Effect team made its demands in meetings with EA regarding the resources it needed, it got its way," Gaider told Bloomberg. "But Dragon Age always had to fight against headwinds."</p><p>In the aftermath, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff and reassigned some developers to other teams inside EA</a>. A much smaller team at BioWare is currently working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After the 2019 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein/" data-ref-id="5000-464088">Code Vein</a>, Bandai Namco staked its claim in a genre it helped popularize as the publisher of games like Dark Souls. Code Vein married that Souls gameplay with its penchant for anime aesthetics to manifest a world of vampires and tough-as-nails action. Now, years later, the team behind that freshman effort is returning with an expanded sequel that will give fans of the sleek anime souls-like more to chew on.</p><p dir="ltr">Keita Iizuka, producer of Code Vein and its sequel, acknowledges that the genre has changed since Code Vein released, but sees it as a challenge to rise to. “Yes, games like Elden Ring are very praised,” Iizuka starts with a glint in his eye, “But I like to consider those games our rivals.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> CODE VEIN 2 — Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-681504">Code Vein 2</a> started development just after the first game wrapped, it is clear that the developers have tried to anticipate where souls-likes might go. While the first title was a bit like souls-likes at the time in structure--which is to say, the non-linear freedom to get lost but not much choice in where to go--Code Vein II looks to rectify this. This time around, the game is expanding around the edges, letting players look for bosses and dungeons in an open environment. The player-character, once again custom-made, even has a slick motorcycle to help facilitate exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">And explore you must, even if you have played the first title. Code Vein 2’s world has no connection to the first game in terms of narrative, IIzuka says.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is a new world, new characters, and a new story,” he explains. This does mean that Code Vein’s ending cliffhanger, which implied a connection to the God Eater series but still left fans desperate to know more, will not be followed up on with the sequel. Those hoping for some resolution to the harsh cut-to-black tease from Code Vein’s ending will not find it in this sequel, at least as far as Iizuka is willing to admit right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994"></a><figcaption>Code Vein 2 does not follow up on the first game's cliffhanger ending.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Instead, Code Vein’s narrative tells the story of a world where humans and revenants, the series’ name for vampires, must join forces to stave off a world-destroying force that threatens them both. To do so, you as a revenant hunter must travel between the past and the present to better the world. This is also the driving force behind Code Vein 2’s other major improvement: a time-travel mechanic where actions and quests in the past affect the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for examples, Iizuka mentioned that saving a bridge repairman in the past gives the player access to a dungeon they otherwise might not have been able to reach in the present. If an NPC has a life goal of creating a specific tool, that character may not have survived into the present, but helping them achieve their goal likely means that tool is waiting for you to use years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those new mechanics, Code Vein 2 is not looking to reinvent the wheel. Iizuka is clear-eyed on his vision: marrying sleek anime-style characters and action with the more thoughtful and pensive gameplay of a souls-like. As such, players will find aspects of Code Vein have been expanded, like a brand-new agile dual-wielding weapon type to attack enemies while looking cool doing it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995"></a><figcaption>Like the first game, partner NPCs play a crucial role in combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Partners also once again play a major role, which Iizuka believes sets the Code Vein series apart from other games. With it, players encounter and recruit NPCs to go through dungeons and beat bosses with them. The decision of who to take with you is a strategic one, but even characters who may not make sense strategically could be a player’s favorite or have story implications. Iizuka wants players to have to think hard about who has their back.</p><p dir="ltr">“That sense of overcoming trials and achieving victory creates a unique sense of enjoyment,” he explains. “Because [Code Vein 2] takes place in a different world with new characters, even if you have played [Code Vein], I think you will fall in love with these new characters.”</p><p dir="ltr">Code Vein 2 is releasing in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
