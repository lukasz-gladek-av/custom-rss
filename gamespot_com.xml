                <p>PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting February 4--<strong>Payday 3</strong>, <strong>High on Life</strong>, and <strong>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-january-2025/1100-6528590/" data-ref-id="1100-6528590">January's PlayStation Plus free games yet</a>, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p>Sony also mentioned that it will focus more on offering PS5 titles through the monthly games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. While PS4 owners may still receive free games as part of the subscription,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-moving-away-from-monthly-ps4-games/1100-6529101/" data-ref-id="1100-6529101"> Sony says these will only be occasionally handed out from next year</a>.</p><h2>Payday 3</h2><p>It hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for Payday 3, which was supposed to kick off the next era of the popular bank-heist-simulator series. While the core game isn't bad, numerous server issues and low player numbers made for a rough launch, but developer Starbreeze hasn't thrown in the towel on Payday 3. yet. As part of an effort titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-and-lots-more-in-a-series-of-patches/1100-6521545/" data-ref-id="1100-6521545">Operation Medic Bag</a>, Starbreeze has been steadily improving on the game with several patches and an offline mode.</p><h2>High on Life</h2><p>If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, then High on Life will appeal to you as it shares much of the same oddball humor as the hit animated series. A first-person shooter that features <em>very</em> talkative guns and an alien space cartel who get "high" on humans, the game was made by Squanch Games, a studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland and Tanya Watson. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-resigns-from-squanch-games-amid-domestic-violence-allegations/1100-6510838/" data-ref-id="1100-6510838">Roiland resigned from the company in 2023</a>, following a series of controversies.</p><h2>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</h2><p>A remake of the original Pac-Man World platformer, Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is a charming game featuring the Bandai Namco icon. Its gameplay was overhauled and its graphics were updated for this 2022 release, which saw Pac-Man embark on a quest to save his friends and family from the ghosts who had kidnapped them.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus Free Games for February 2025</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512"></a><figcaption>PS Plus February 2025 free games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg"></figure><p><em>Available February 4 until March 3.</em></p><ul><li>Payday 3</li><li>High on Life</li><li>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</li></ul>

                <p>Sony has announced a key change for the future of PlayStation Plus. Sony will shift away from offering PS4 games as it looks to focus on PS5 games instead. Sony said it's making this change as part of the evolution of PS Plus overall. This isn't starting soon, though, and will begin in January 2026.</p><p>"As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date," Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-payday-3-high-on-life-pac-man-world-re-pac/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>PS4 games that players have already redeemed from PS Plus are not affected, provided players stay subscribed to PlayStation Plus. "For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh," Sony said.</p><p>Sony went on to say it plans to "continue to evolve" PS Plus and will "optimize the benefits you receive" over time. "As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy," Sony said.</p><p>Sony made this announcement as part of a wider reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-february-2025/1100-6529091/" data-ref-id="1100-6529091">the February batch of free games for PS Plus subscribers</a>.

                <p>We've all participated in some form of online trash talk at some point in our lives. UFC fighter Brian Ortega, whose professional record is currently 16-4, was on the receiving end of some serious berating during a Fortnite game and decided to do something about it.</p><p>Ortega posted a video on his social media where he had a light-hearted confrontation with a young fan named Emi. Ortega flew from Los Angeles to North Carolina to exact his revenge in a way that might have Emi thinking differently about who he talks trash to online, as the former champion planted him in a rear naked choke and put him to sleep momentarily.</p><p>"A lot of people ask me, 'Hey, play with me on Fortnite!' Cool, cool. Only problem is, you guys be talking mad you-know-what," Ortega said. "So I had a homie, an online homie, start talking mad smack. The real reason why I flew to North Carolina is because he was talking shit, we made a bet. I said, 'Bro, I’ll fly over there and choke you out.' Here he is. I showed up."</p><p>The camera panned to Emi sitting down. Ortez continued by asking Emi "You going to go to sleep?"</p><p>Emi responded with "yes" while lightly laughing.</p><p>Ortega then applied a fully locked-in rear-naked choke to the fan and squeezed until he passed out. After a few seconds, the young man then woke up and flashed a peace sign to ensure Ortega's audience he was all right in the end.</p><p>"Shit, man! I took a nap! That felt weird," Emi added. "That shit was kinda fun!"</p><p>"When talking crap on Fortnite turns into a real-life lesson," Ortega wrote in the post. "For all my gamers out there, remember you never know who you might be playing with--respect to Emi for taking it like a man. No one was harmed in the making of this video. Professionals only."</p><p><em>Image source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IVFp2l2jl8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFC</a></em></p>

                <p>When it comes to court battles, very few individuals would want to be on the opposite side of Nintendo. The video game company famously defeated Universal Pictures in a Donkey Kong-related case four decades ago, and it's rarely lost a high-profile case. But now, there's at least one man who can claim a legal victory over Nintendo: Don Mario. Well, sort of.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-loses-trademark-fight-against-super-mario-supermarket" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Don Mario is the owner of Super Mario, a local supermarket in San Ramón, Costa Rica. Nintendo seemingly left the Super Mario shop alone for years, and only opposed the store's name when Don Mario had to renew the trademark with Costa Rica's trademark authority, the National Register. Apparently, one of the reasons why Don Mario--and his son, Charlito--emerged victorious is that supermarkets are among the few Super Mario trademarks that Nintendo never bothered to register.</p><p>"Thank you enormously to my legal advisor and accountant José Edgardo Jimenez Blanco who took care of the registration and the subsequent fight for the right to a trademark," wrote Charlito Mario on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/supermariosr/posts/pfbid0oDC4Z9GKPdLtrDiGmG3tXRNW6qTZXgGwn7T93WPmHPWm8m2Q6jDhxmNpPaV63zUXl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>. "For a moment, we thought about throwing in the towel. How were we going to win the [fight against] such a commercial monster? ... Well... Edgardo and I stood firm and a few days ago we received the good news. Super Mario is here to stay."</p><p>As for Nintendo, the famously litigious company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">went after an alleged Switch pirate in court</a>, and reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">sent lawyers to visit Genki</a> after it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">showed off a Switch 2 mockup</a> during CES. Nintendo's patent attorney Koji Nishiura also recently explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-the-company-believes-some-emulators-are-illegal/1100-6528831/" data-ref-id="1100-6528831">why the company believes some emulators are illegal</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Age of Empires 25th Anniversary Livestream</p>
      </div>
<p>Explaining what happened in the first place, Microsoft said it announced the DLC too early, "before it had been built." Looking back on this, the team said, "We now feel that announcement was premature."</p><p>"We know that this is a huge disappointment, and many of you were excited for more content. We were able to put out a patch for the game towards the end of last year but understand that it was not the size and scope you were hoping for," the developer said.</p><p>The Age of Empires development team went on to say that, although the promised DLC is not coming, the studio will keep the game's servers online and provide customer support services. The team also pointed fans to the official <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/?q=&amp;game=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Age of Empires 3 mods</a> page to find something new to play.</p><p>The canceled DLC was originally expected to launch in 2024, but was delayed indefinitely prior to its cancellation. Details about what the content would be were never disclosed.</p><p>The last expansion for Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition was 2022's Knights of the Mediterranean. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is not the newest edition of the game, as Microsoft released Age of Empires IV in 2021 and Age of Mythology: Retold in 2024.</p>
