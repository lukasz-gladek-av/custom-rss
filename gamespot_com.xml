          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<h3 id="New_map_and_community_unlock_event">New map and community unlock event</h3><p>The game's first four maps have been joined by a fifth called Stella Montis. Referred to as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions," Stella Montis will presumably be an unforgiving map filled with snow or icy conditions.</p><p>This new map requires the community to work together to open, however, meaning it won't be available immediately. This multi-phase community event--called Breaking New Ground--will begin at <strong>1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET</strong> and ask players to figure out how to open the path to Stella Montis via the tunnels in Speranza.</p><p>As everyone works toward contributing resources to the tunnel efforts, they'll earn a new currency called Merits that will help push things to a second phase of the event called "Staking Our Claim," which will unleash players into Stella Montis with an all-new progression track, challenges, and rewards. This portion of the event will last until December.</p><h3 id="New_enemies">New enemies</h3><p>The North Line update also includes two new ARC foes for players to take down: Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>The Matriarch is described as "a hulking ARC that makes the Queen look friendly by comparison," so you'll want to start getting your Wolfpacks and Hullcrackers ready. This giant enemy will only spawn during certain map conditions, similarly to the Queen's Harvester event.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Shredder is exclusively available to fight on Stella Montis, and it's expected to force players into close-quarters encounters. In a game where even a hit or two can spell disaster, the Shredder sounds terrifying by name alone.</p><h3 id="New_rifle__grenades__and_mines">New rifle, grenades, and mines</h3><p>Another weapon called the Aphelion joins the fray, too, adding another energy-based firearm for players to use when tackling the ARC. In addition to this fresh weapon are two new grenades--Seeker Grenade and Trailblazer Grenade--and three new mines--Pulse Mine, Deadline Mine, and Gas Mine.</p><h3 id="New_quests">New quests</h3><p>Lastly, players can continue helping Speranza with a new questline focused on Stella Montis and the resources (and dangers) that await there. We'll be updating our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a> with these as we dive in and begin taking on the ARC in Stella Montis.</p><h3 id="More_on_the_way_in_December">More on the way in December</h3><p>The North Line update is just the beginning of a long road ahead for raiders enjoying their time in Arc Raiders. Embark Studios has already teased what to expect in its next major update, saying, "The North Line is just the beginning of Arc Raiders’ post-launch roadmap. The next update, Cold Snap, arrives this December--introducing the Flickering Flames event, new snowfall Map Condition, the awaited Expedition Project Raider reset, and more."</p>

                <p>Only a few weeks after the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, fans learned that the franchise's new cozy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>, is coming in early 2026. However, Pokopia will only be given a physical release as a Game-Key Card, rather than a cartridge with the full game. That's proven to be a controversial topic among Switch 2 players, some of whom are angry enough that they claim they'll skip Pokopia entirely.</p><p>Nintendo of Japan's <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a> confirmed Pokopia's Game-Key release, followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official YouTube video</a> that used it as a Game-Key Card example, and the reaction has been swift. Unlike digital releases, fans are able to resell Game-Key cards. But for players who prefer to own the complete game on a cartridge, it's viewed as Nintendo breaking its pledge not to publish its own games that way. The game was developed by Koei Tecmo's Omega Force, so technically Nintendo hasn't broken that promise. However, not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Nintendo introduced Game-Key Cards alongside the Switch 2 in part as a way to mitigate the size restrictions of Switch 2 cartridges. The only thing on the card is a digital license that allows the player to download the game directly to their Switch 2. This differs from a digital purchase in that the Game-Key Card needs to be in the console for the game to play, but it's also transferable to a new owner if the player who purchased it no longer wants it. </p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will be released on March 5, 2026 for Switch 2. On Thursday, November 13, Nintendo will debut a new trailer for Pokopia that will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay.

                <p>Activision has released more details on what its teams are doing to try to stop cheaters in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for its upcoming launch this week.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ricochet-anticheat-day-one#Evolved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision reminded people that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-enable-tpm-2-0-so-that-your-pc-is-ready-for-windows-11/1100-6496686/" data-ref-id="1100-6496686">need TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</a> to play Black Ops 7 on PC as the foundation for anti-cheat measures. Activision says this can be thought of as a handshake that tells its Ricochet anti-cheat system about your PC, "I'm legit. Let's play."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The developer said it has "evolved" its machine-learning-based anti-cheat measures with the aim of helping the system become "smarter, faster, and fairer."</p><p>"Our aimbot-detection models are trained to decide whether a player’s targeting was performed by a human or an aimbot. In Black Ops 7, these updated models will discriminate between natural aim and cheating with even greater precision by taking what they have learned from real gameplay to catch more cheaters than before," the developer explained.</p><p>Beyond aiming, Activison's Ricochet anti-cheat efforts include behavioral models that examine <em>how </em>people play to deduce if they are possibly cheating. "These upgraded models now analyze not just where a player aims, but how they move, how they engage, and how their play changes," Activision said.</p><p>As an example, if a player is consistently getting kills on a map at places that aren't usually "hotspots," this can be flagged "for deeper analysis."</p><p>"Our pattern recognition is trained on real matches, learning what genuine skill looks like--and recognizing when it's not," Activision said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Activision said some of the new anti-cheat systems for Black Ops 7 that were tested in the multiplayer beta will be "even more effective" when the game launches.</p><p>"Our mission is simple: Make every round you play fair. Each Ricochet anti-cheat upgrade means cleaner matches and wins that reflect real skill. You deserve nothing less, and that's our promise to you," Activision said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is available to preload now. For more, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-times-and-preloading-info-revealed/1100-6535917/" data-ref-id="1100-6535917">Black Ops 7 release times</a>, including details on how to trick your console into thinking it's in New Zealand so you can play early.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"First of all, I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: How do you survive? I believe it's important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p>To answer his own question of surviving in a competitive development market, Lee expressed that "human creativity" is what'll push an OK game to a fabulous game. This sentiment mirrors what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer in October 2025</a>, that there are "no shortcuts to making great games" despite using AI to "assist in some content creation."</p><p>Not everyone agrees with either Lee or Strandberg, though. Strange Scaffold founder Xavier Nelson Jr. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded with condemnation on Bluesky</a>, personally confirming that "a lot of other studios"--whether indie or AAA--are not using generative AI in their games. Tommy Thompson, founder of AI video game analysis company AI in Games, also disputed Lee's argument, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tommy.aiandgames.com/post/3m5geygzyzs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on Bluesky</a> that "very few [studios] have gone all in" on AI. Developer Neil Jones, creator of the 3D runner Aerial_Knight's Never Yield, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aerialknight.com/post/3m5gwkm6iw22h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that this is an admission that "they're going to fire you." And former Chucklefish animator Adam Riches shared his contempt for Lee's comments, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supernorn.bsky.social/post/3m5gohsq7qk2m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking to Bluesky</a> to say that Nexon is "too cheap to care about their craft."</p><p>While people are upset with Lee's notion that "every game company is now using AI," one CEO came to his defense: Epic Games' Tim Sweeney. Posting in <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the replies to Eurogamer's review on X</a>, Sweeney said that "political opinions" should stay in the opinion section, not reviews. He continued in <a href="https://x.com/Doubttom/status/1988054048579481663" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to X user doubttom</a>, who asked if disliking AI should be considered political:</p><p>"Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines," Sweeney said. "Since the author states the pessimistic case, I’ll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people."</p><p>It's worth noting that there are some AAA studios banking on AI. EA said its workers should view the controversial technology as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" while demanding its employees train AI on their work. Krafton Inc. has announced plans to invest $70 million to become an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">AI-first company</a>." Square Enix wants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">generative AI to automate at least 70% of game QA and debugging work</a>. And even Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741">laid out plans for incorporating AI in its games</a> going forward. This is not to mention the myriad developers who've recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI should be embraced by the industry</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">those who refuse to work with it will sell themselves short</a>.</p><p>Although a hot-button topic, this isn't the first time Embark Studios has used AI in its games. The developer's last game, the 2023 free-to-play multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-finals/" data-ref-id="5000-570887">The Finals</a>, also featured text-to-speech (TTS) that was generated using AI because <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-finals-uses-ai-text-to-speech-because-it-can-produce-lines-in-just-a-matter-of-hours-rather-than-months-baffles-actual-voice-actors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the team could produce voice lines in hours rather than months</a>. Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-finals-dev-defends-ai-voices-says-its-not-trying-to-replace-humans/1100-6518802/" data-ref-id="1100-6518802">defended its choice back then</a>, stating that "making games without actors isn't an end goal" and a combination of recorded voice audio and audio generated via TTS tools merely expedited the process.</p><p>Regardless of the discourse surrounding the game, Arc Raiders has been a smash hit since its October 30 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">smoked the multiplayer shooter Helldivers 2</a>, becoming one of the most-played games on Steam.</p>
