                <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> launching day on on Game Pass recently, some wondered if the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">1 million sales figure</a> could have been even higher had it not launched into the subscription service. This is not a new debate, as people have been discussing the economical merits of Game Pass for years, but Expedition 33 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">and Oblivion Remastered</a>) coming to Game Pass recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">reignited the chatter.</a></p><p>Palworld communications and publishing boss John "Bucky" Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916636430992052706" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighed in on social media</a>, writing that Expedition 33 is just the latest game to be "unwittingly dragged" through online discussions about Game Pass. Buckley said he has more knowledge than most on this topic given Palworld launched day one into Game Pass back in 2024 to great success.</p><p>"I'll just say yes, yes it is very worth having your game on Game Pass," he said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916710392778350762" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a>, the developer reminded people that he's speaking from the perspective of an independent game developer, so his comments should be understand from that context. Buckley said he has no experience in the AAA space and can't speak to "what sort of deals are cooked up there."</p><p>But Buckley said Palworld developer Pocketpair has brought two games already to Game Pass--Palworld and Craftopia--and the studio is "very happy with both."</p><h2><strong>"Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming"</strong></h2><p>Much of the discussion around Game Pass has centered on whether or not a subscription service like Game Pass could take over and become the dominant form of game consumption in the future. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said he doesn't see that happening, at least not soon.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnsxkebdjk24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that spending on video game subscription services in the US experienced growth in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID and a little more at the end of 2024 thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass. But in general, spending on subscription services has been "basically flat" lately.</p><p>As such, Piscatella said, "Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming (although they can continue to be part of it)."</p><p>Not everyone is as optimistic about Game Pass as Buckley from Pocketpair when it comes to launching games into the service. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said this kind of strategy for big new releases has never made sense, and instead represents a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">"lost opportunity" for a game sale.</a></p><p>Take-Two might consider bringing older titles to Game Pass, like Take-Two recently did by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">bringing GTA 5 back to Game Pass</a>, but for new releases, it doesn't make business sense for Take-Two, Zelnick said. Take-Two has one of the most highly anticipated games of all time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, coming up soon, and no one should expect it to come to Game Pass at launch or soon thereafter. Experts believe the game could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in its first year alone</a>, so it's not hard to understand why Take-Two wouldn't want to put the game into a subscription service out of the gate, or ever.</p><p>Every company operates differently and has different goals in mind, and Take-Two's business approach doesn't have to line up with what other companies are doing.</p><p>For example, Rebellion just recently launched Atomfall into Game Pass on day one, and it led to Atomfall experiencing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-release-atomfall-is-devs-most-successful-game-in-32-years/1100-6530519/" data-ref-id="1100-6530519">biggest debut for any game in Rebellion's 32-year history. </a> A key thing to know here, however, is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">Microsoft paid Rebellion for this</a>, thus mitigating some of the cannibalization risk. Rebellion's own CEO said the company might have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">lost out on game sales by launching into Game Pass</a>, but on balance, it was the right thing for his company in this particular situation.</p><p>Even Microsoft itself has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">games that launch into Game Pass are known to experience decreased game sales.</a></p><p>This discussion and debate is not going to be resolved soon, or ever. Game Pass represents <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">a paradigm shift in the gaming landscape</a>, and was always going to elicit passionate responses from fans and pundits.</p>

Despite middling ratings and reception when it originally aired in Japan, the anime found new life in North America several years later thanks to its after-school time slot. The show, with its dramatic mech-on-mech action and even more dramatic sci-fi melodrama, almost single-handedly established a foothold for the entire Gundam universe in the West. In the process, it created an entirely new generation of Gundam fans eager for more, helping to bring more Gundam shows overseas and creating a new market for the franchise's popular Gunpla plastic model kits.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Official Gundam Wing Collaboration Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Flash forward to 2025, and Gundam Wing is celebrating its 30th anniversary in a number of ways, among them crossing over with Blizzard's free-to-play shooter with four premium skins that pay homage to some of the show's most popular Mobile Suit designs. Mercy takes on the starring role as Gundam Wing Zero, while Soldier: 76 transforms into the iconic Tallgeese piloted in the show by the masked Zechs Merquise. Ramattra, meanwhile, transforms into the fearsome Gundam Epyon. And, of course, Overwatch's designated edgelord himself, Reaper, adopts the mantle of none other than Gundam Deathscythe.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to talk with Overwatch 2 art director Dion Rogers and associate director of product management Aimee Dennett on how the crossover came to be, what it was like to work with Bandai, other Gundam Wing characters didn't make the cut, and the role Gunpla model kits played in both the selection of which Mobile Suits to feature and in the actual look of the skins themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it has long wanted to collaborate with Gundam, as it's one of the most-requested IPs among the staff. When it reached out to IP-holder Bandai about a potential crossover, the pieces began to fall into place for Gundam Wing's 30th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the first decisions Blizzard had to make was which version of the Gundam Wing's various Mobile Suit designs it wanted to use: those from the show, or ones from its sequel movie, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. Blizzard opted for the latter, though it wasn't an easy decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a big debate around do we use the Gundam Wing show designs, or do we use the Endless Waltz film designs?" Dennett said. "So that kind of doubled the amount of possibilities. We did a lot of the characters in both the film design and the show design. We wanted to pick one or the other. We didn't want to do a mix, so we ended up liking the collection of the film."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286" data-ratio="0.56256684491979" data-width="1870" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286"></a><figcaption>Some pairings, like Gundam Deathscythe and Reaper, were an obvious choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When deciding on which Overwatch characters would get skins, Rogers said it came down to a number of factors. First and foremost, the team narrowed down which characters would seem like a strong fit or ones who would seem odd not to include. The team then looked at factors like whether or not a particular character hadn't received a skin in a while or which ones might surprise players to use. Some combinations were obvious for thematic reasons, like Reaper and Deathscythe, or for visual reasons, like Wing Zero and Mercy due to them both having wings.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blizzard eventually landed on the four Mobile Suits and Overwatch heroes mentioned above for the collaboration, there were others that didn't make the cut. Rogers said he really wanted to make something work for D.Va due to her already being a mech pilot and the opportunity to have her cosplay as one of the show's human characters, but that Blizzard couldn't quite make it work.</p><p dir="ltr">Ana, for example, was originally proposed for Tallgeese but didn't come together. Gundam Heavyarms, a fan-favorite featured prominently in the show, was a shoe-in for the gatling-gun wielding Mauga that also didn't pan out in the end, with Zarya being another potential candidate. Dennett said Mauga's Heavyarms weapon looked "unbelievable," but that overall, the skin just didn't look right on the character.</p><p dir="ltr">"For Heavyarms, he was actually in the lineup," Dennett said. "We tried him on Mauga just because their weaponry is so similar. It's funny, you always have in your head, 'Oh, these are obvious combinations,' but once you see it on paper, it's not. Some don't look as great and some look absolutely amazing. We never planned Tallgeese on Soldier: 76, but once we saw the design, it was the opposite of Mauga Heavyarms. We were like, 'Oh, that looks so cool.'"</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483338,1300-4483337,1300-4483330,1300-4483329" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deciding which Mobile Suits to ultimately feature as part of the collab was its own process, one Blizzard said was informed not only by fans of Gundam Wing on the Overwatch team but with help from Bandai. The company also collaborated with Blizzard on how each character should look.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers said Overwatch crossover skins always take the approach of the game's heroes "cosplaying" as their favorite characters. Blizzard initially worked hard on making each skin appear more Gundam and less Overwatch due to player feedback from previous collabs, while still trying to maintain each hero's unique and recognizable silhouette. Bandai came back to Blizzard and instead wanted to see more of each Overwatch hero, like Ramattra, in the designs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bandai felt like they didn't want us just slapping Gundam Wing on top of Overwatch," Rogers said. "They wanted to really feel super collaborative and they really leaned in on that idea that our characters are still there, but their IP."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328" data-ratio="0.56273358248799" data-width="1873" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328"></a><figcaption>Ramattra as the popular Gundam Epyon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bandai also had cold, hard data to help inform which Mobile Suits might be best to include for the collab--specifically, data related to Gunpla model kit sales. A Bandai artist who does artwork for Gunpla kits even contributed the collab's in-game lobby artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">"They didn't mandate we do anything," Dennett said. "It was all suggestions, but they did share a ranking of Gunpla sales and that did factor into the equation…That's not to say Gunpla sales were the factor, but it definitely helped us inform which were a pretty obvious choice and which ones weren't."</p><p dir="ltr">Gunpla played a role in the creation of the actual skins, too. Rogers said the team examined the actual Gunpla models for each Mobile Suit and looked to mimic their internal structure in their respective skin.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the actual models in-game, we tried to match pretty closely the skeletal work, within reason, the internal structure of the Gunpla, onto the actual hero," Rogers said. "Obviously they're human, so you can do only so much, but it's pretty authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2's Gundam Wing collab goes live April 29, with its four Mobile Suit-inspired skins joining the in-game shop alongside free Gundam-themed challenge rewards, including unique Pachimari weapon charm. Bundles for each skin (and corresponding items like sprays and Play of the Game animations) will cost 2,800 Overwatch Coins, with a mega bundle containing everything going for 5,900 coins.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Meta is laying off over 100 employees from its Reality Labs division, which focuses on VR, AR, and wearable hardware, an unnamed source recently revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The layoff has primarily impacted Reality Labs employees who were working on VR software for the company's line of Meta Quest headsets, along with employees who were focused on hardware, (including VR headsets), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">the source shared with Bloomberg</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the source--who asked not to be named due to the fact that they were sharing details that had not yet been made available to the public--Meta's goal is to combine and streamline tasks being worked on by the two teams within Reality Labs. In June 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-reality-check-inside-the-45-billion-cash-burn-at-reality-labs-125717347.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Labs had lost nearly $50 billion</a> over the course of the previous four years.</p><p dir="ltr">Meta has confirmed that layoffs have taken place, but refused to elaborate or provide details on exactly how many employees had been affected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size," Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said when asked to comment on the layoffs. "These changes are meant to help studios work more efficiently on future mixed-reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the content Meta has evidently deemed as expendable includes <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/supernatural/?srsltid=AfmBOop7SLuRXUollXinrhtzlvqbhia_JeGP90rgo-2m0Nn3XnzqZYYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supernatural</a>, a VR-based fitness app that gives users access to training content from various fitness coaches and personal trainers, including a stretching program led by Jane Fonda and a "Boxing With Bon Jovi" workout. Supernatural was initially created by Within Unlimited (formerly Vrse), which Meta attempted to acquire in 2021. After a drawn-out fight with the FTC, Meta ultimately won its case and acquired Within (and its products, including Supernatural) in February 2023 for a grand total of $400 million. </p><p dir="ltr">Now, just over two years after the acquisition, Supernatural's future is up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're deeply saddened to share that these changes have resulted in the loss of some of our incredibly talented team members," Supernatural <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">said on Facebook</a> last week, adding that the number of workout releases each week would be reduced going forward as a result of the layoffs.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Meta, Clayton claims that the company is "committed to investing in mixed-reality experiences including fitness and games."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged," Clayton said.</p><p>The Reality Labs layoffs are far from the first to hit Meta's workforce. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-lays-off-11000-workers-after-stock-slides-nearly-20/1100-6509047/">laid off 13% of its staff</a> (roughly 11,000 employees) back in 2022, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/meta-is-planning-to-cut-5-of-lowest-performers-memo-shows" rel="nofollow ">laid off another 5%</a> (~3,600 employees) earlier this year.</p>
