                <p>A new music video from Jackboys &amp; Travis Scott seemingly contains a reference to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, prompting fans to theorize that the "Sicko Mode" singer may have some involvement in the Rockstar game.</p><p>At the end of the video for "2000 Excursion," a car with the license plate "GTA VI6" can be seen prominently. Not only that, but it appears to be a Florida license plate, which is notable because GTA 6 takes place in Vice City, a stand-in for Miami, Florida. Have a look for yourself:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwuYa2DcC-o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dwuYa2DcC-o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The GTA 6 reference doesn't necessarily mean anything, but Scott does have a history of partnering with video game companies. In 2020, Scott teamed up with Epic Games for an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/travis-scott-played-a-fortnite-concert-heres-how-i/1100-6476459/" data-ref-id="1100-6476459">epic Fortnite concert</a>, scoring himself a reported <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/11/30/how-hip-hop-superstar-travis-scott-has-become-corporate-americas-brand-whisperer/?sh=5e94aa0674e7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 million.</a></p><p>It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">DJ Khaled and Drake might feature in GTA 6 with their own in-game radio stations</a>. Nothing is confirmed, yet, but Rockstar does have a history of working with real musicians for their own radio stations, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">Roy Ayers in GTA 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean in GTA 5.</a></p><p>GTA 6 was previously slated to release this year before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed it to May 26, 2026.</a></p><p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game," Rockstar said.</p><p>It was reported that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fall 2025 was not a "real window" for the game</a>, and that a slip to 2026 was inevitable. Rockstar management is reportedly keen to avoid a "brutal crunch" for GTA 6.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be a blockbuster success, with one company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million in sales in the first year alone.</a> The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corsair-ceo-believes-grand-theft-auto-6-will-hit-pc-in-early-2026/1100-6529520/" data-ref-id="1100-6529520">expected to come to PC at a later date</a>, creating a second selling cycle for the open-world game.</p><p>GTA 6 being delayed into 2026 is tough news for the overall gaming market, too, as one research firm predicted that the video game industry was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">relying on GTA 6 in 2025 to help turn things around.</a></p>

                <p>That's the sound of sizzle-ing coming to Minecraft. Jack Black's earworm "Lava Chicken" from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecaft Movie</a> has officially been adapted into the game.

So, how do you get it? Players need to find and defeat a chicken jockey in the game (another part of the movie that became instantly memetic). However, if there are no chickens around, a spawned zombie has a 0.25% chance of being a chicken jockey; if there are chickens around, this is bumped to 0.4875% (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/minecraft-says-to-hell-with-it-adds-in-game-version-of-lava-chicken-song-which-you-get-by-beating-a-chicken-jockey/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41O_MydqxTU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/41O_MydqxTU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At 34 seconds, Jack Black's song from A Minecraft Movie became the shortest ever to crack the Billboard Hot 100 over the summer--a record previously held by, well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowsers-ballad-peaches-from-the-super-mario-bros-movie-cracks-billboard-hot-100/1100-6513350/" data-ref-id="1100-6513350">Jack Black for "Peaches"</a> on the Super Mario Bros.

This particular scene struck a chord with younger audiences, sparking a viral trend across theaters. Kids would enthusiastically shout "chicken jockey" at the screen during the scene, turning screenings into near-chaotic events.</p><p>In some instances, the excitement escalated to the point where theater staff had to call the police to restore order.

                <p dir="ltr">Typically, when a live-service game is shut down by its publisher, the assumption is the game failed to perform in some way--usually financially--and that its underwhelming performance resulted in its discontinuation. Star Wars Hunters--Zynga's multiplayer shooter set in the Star Wars universe--is being shut down in October, but despite a lower-than-anticipated attach rate, Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau says it was "no failure" at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/star-wars-hunters-was-no-failure" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Gibeau said that the team at Zynga built a "great tech base" and a "fun game" with Hunters, but the game did not emerge as a "viable business." Specifically, Gibeau cites a lack of "organic installs from the license" as a contributing factor in its imminent discontinuation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="750" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070"></a><figcaption>Star Wars Hunters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We had some issues with how we could explore the intellectual property--could you play Darth Vader or could you not? That sort of thing," Gibeau said. "We ended up with a cross-platform game on Switch and mobile that ran perfectly. It was fun. But it didn't engage over the long term. And it wasn't a viable business."</p><p dir="ltr">Gibeau also says that ending Hunters will result in another "shot on goal" with another IP, only now with the knowledge and technical base. "The action shooter category on mobile is very large and growing, and we'd like to be there," Gibeau said. "Now we have an Unreal tech base, with some great leads in terms of the engineering, developers and designers…. Now it's taking the learnings from Star Wars Hunters and applying it to another shot on goal with another intellectual property."</p><p dir="ltr">Zynga first announced Star Wars Hunters during a Nintendo Direct presentation in February 2021. It finally launched in June 2024, only for Zynga to announce that the game would cease operations on October 1, 2025--with one final update pushed to all users on April 15. A PC port of the game was also canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Hunters is still available now for mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">To say Dead Island 2's development was rocky is probably an understatement. The action-RPG took nine years from reveal to launch and went through multiple studios in the process. Now, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has revealed part of what happened after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-dead-island-2-revealed-at-sony-press-conference/1100-6420278/">the sequel was unveiled at Sony's E3 2014 press conference</a>. Basically, the game as it existed then "sucked," he said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a> reports that Wein opened up about Dead Island 2 at a Develop:Brighton panel when he was asked whether he could remember a time when marketing or player research assisted in game development. "I can actually give you an example where myself and the product team caused about an eight-year product delay," said Wein.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> E3 2014: Dead Island 2 Trailer at Sony Press Conference</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now with GameFlex Consultants, Wein stated that he and his team "were mightily proud" of Dead Island 2's reveal trailer--seen above. The video sees a jogger going for a run on the beachfront before turning into a zombie himself. About a month after the trailer's debut, Wein said that "we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked."</p><p dir="ltr">At that time, Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager was working on Dead Island 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-loses-its-developer/1100-6428894/">before being removed in 2015</a>. Wein stated that the game back then "had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun." Wein added that they received "horrific feedback" from a playtest, which the studio claimed it would address. But that didn't happen, according to Wein. This set off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-has-been-delayed-again/1100-6509232/">a chain of delays for Dead Island 2</a>, and ultimately the game went through another developer in Sumo Digital before Dambuster Studios delivered the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein said. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2019, Koch Media made a similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2s-long-development-is-a-good-sign-pub/1100-6471576/">argument for Dead Island 2's long development being a good thing</a>. The sequel finally arrived in 2023 and sold over 3 million copies.
