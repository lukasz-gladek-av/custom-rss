                <p>Following the spectacular Death Star Sabotage season finale event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline for maintenance ahead of the launch of Chapter 6 Season 3. The Emperor has been defeated, the Empire has been run off the Fortnite island yet again, and after five short weeks of Star Wars mayhem, it's time for Fortnite to move on to its summer season, which has only just slightly been officially revealed--more on that in a moment.</p><p>Star Wars season was an unorthodox one for Epic Games, which had never dropped a season quite like this one before--past mini seasons were throwbacks, rather than full-throated collaboration events, though last year's Remix season blurred that line. But now that it's over, Fortnite is going back to a more standard season for the summer. And we won't have long to wait for it to get started.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start time</h2><p>Every previous time that a Fortnite season ended with a live event on a Saturday, the game went offline until at least Sunday morning. But this time, it seems as though Season 3 will instead be launching <em>tonight</em>.</p><p>Players who completed the Death Star Sabotage event were greeted with a timer counting down to the start of the new season--but it said it would start in less than six hours. The timer is counting down to 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on Saturday evening. That doesn't necessarily guarantee that it actually will be back online then, since maintenance downtime length can be unpredictable, but clearly that is what Epic Games is aiming for.</p><p>Given that, you can expect Fortnite to be back online <strong>sometime during the evening after 5 PM PT on Saturday.</strong></p><p>The timer screen also <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931415424442236993" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Superman will be headlining the new season, the first official confirmation of a recent leak. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">Read more about the new season right here</a>.</p>
