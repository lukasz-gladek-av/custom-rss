                <p>Season 17 of Rare's online pirate title Sea of Thieves was announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it'll add a mischievous new faction to the game's sandbox called The Smuggler's League. The upcoming season, titled Smugglers' Tide, begins in August and includes new Voyages and some of the most powerful explosives in the game.</p><p>Judging from the trailer, The Smuggler's League is all about, well, smuggling loot, salvaging treasure and other goodies from sunken ships or stealing them from other players. Some of the new loot showcased in the trailer includes crates filled with golden bottles and black gunpowder barrels, which will most certainly explode if mishandled, but players can weaponize their explosive capabilities.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalWScU3-dU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GalWScU3-dU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer showcases characters using harpoon guns to snag loot and employing stealth tactics to make off with explosive barrels. While the trailer doesn't go into detail about faction-specific rewards, expect to earn several exclusive cosmetics for completing Smuggler's Voyages and commendations.</p><p>The current season of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/" data-ref-id="1100-6531724" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/">one-of-a-kind Sea of Thieves</a>, titled Reapers Rule, began on May 22, adding new content for The Reaper's Bones faction. The season also added a new Voyage, the ability to summon NPC skeletons to assist your crew, and a portable cannon called the Cannon of Rage.</p><p>Rare is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/" data-ref-id="1100-6529543" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/">developing a title called Everwild</a>, but the game was a no-show at this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

                <p>Keeper, the newest game from acclaimed adventure-game developers Double Fine and veteran designer Lee Petty, was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. As the name implies, the game involves a moving lighthouse--though whether you're playing and the lighthouse or a being managing it (a "keeper") isn't quite clear. A green bird appears frequently alongside the lighthouse, seeming to aid and guide the lighthouse as it travels through a variety of colorful environments including gemstone-adorned caves, treacherous cliffsides, ancient ruins, and a desolate plain. The bird also seems to be important for solving puzzles, as the trailer demonstrates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAwVgTsFfk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also get a brief look at some very large beings that could either be mechanical monstrosities or organic giants. How the lighthouse will deal with these obstacles, or if they're even threats at all, remains unclear. Keeper will release on Xbox Series X and PC on October 17, 2025.</p>

                <p>Persona 4 Revival was officially unveiled during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-persona-4-remake-to-be-announced-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6532183/">following several recent leaks</a>. Like last year's Persona 3 Reloaded, this new version of Persona 4 is a brand-new edition of the classic 2008 RPG by Atlus.</p><p>The announcement teaser is light on information, aside from confirming that it takes place in the quiet countryside town of Inaba away from the bustling metropolis of the other entries, with a few shots of its high school classrooms and the town's streets, with just a few seconds of the protagonist running through them. It of course won't be too long before he goes head-first into a strange mystery storyline, as he joins his friends to investigate seemingly unsolvable murders while harnessing the power of Personas to crack the case.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Persona 4 Revival - Teaser Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>A remake of Persona 4 became the worst-kept secret in gaming, as prior to its announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-voice-actor-says-he-wasnt-invited-back-for-a-still-unannounced-remake/1100-6531861/">voice actor Yuri Lowenthal confirmed that he would not be reprising his role</a> as Yosuke Hanamura for the game. "For those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal said in a since-deleted post on BlueSky. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p>Other actors linked to the original game also mentioned that they wouldn't be back, and a domain registration linked to the game added more fuel to the fire. It is worth noting that an enhanced version of the original game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/">Persona 4 Golden</a>, is available right now in case you don't want to wait for the remake. First released for the PS Vita handheld in 2012, it was later ported to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Didn't we just get a new Black Ops game in 2024? We did, and this will be the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is being developed by Treyarch and Raven Software--the same lead co-developers as Black Ops 6--and takes place in the year 2035. That's more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6 and 10 years after the events of Black Ops 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUo5gnaYB_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uUo5gnaYB_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Activision said the story in Black Ops 7 will be the "most mind-bending" ever, and that's saying something for a series known for its twists and turns.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 7, "the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." David Mason and his team return to fight a "manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else." The game will allow players to use "cutting-edge technology."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has a campaign mode that supports solo and co-op, along with multiplayer, of course. Black Ops 7 also brings back round-based Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, Activision has only released the cinematic teaser seen above, but the company said it will have more announcements to share in the weeks and months ahead. Activision Publishing boss Tyler Bahl said, "We're excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968" data-ratio="0.55820476858345" data-width="713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 is coming this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The "full reveal" for Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, but Activision didn't say when that might happen. Activision also didn't reveal a release date but confirmed the game is coming this year to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Xbox PC app, Steam, and Battle.net). Being a first-party title, Black Ops 7 is also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass at launch. There was no mention of Black Ops 7 for Nintendo Switch 2, which is curious considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/">Microsoft and Nintendo have a decade-long Call of Duty deal.</a></p>

                <p>A pair of Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox, and one of them is coming <em>extremely</em> soon. As announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming this winter. And the most recent numbered series entry, Final Fantasy XVI, is coming to Xbox today.</p><p>A brief trailer showed off both games back to back. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/final-fantasy-16-xbox-games-showcase/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">associated blog entry</a> noted that every mainline, single-player Final Fantasy game is coming to Xbox platforms, so that will surely include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth as well. No release date has been given for that second part of the Remake trilogy.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the full version of Remake, including the Yuffie-centered DLC that leads the story right into Rebirth. Final Fantasy XVI, meanwhile, is its own story following Clive Rosfield as he navigates global politics in a world where kingdoms have access to massive destructive summoned creatures called Eikons as their ultimate power.</p>

                <p>Don't Nod announced its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aphelion/" data-ref-id="5000-681581">Aphelion</a>, at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p><p>As seen in the announcement trailer, Aphelion sees you play as Ariane, an astronaut lost on the newly discovered ninth planet in our solar system (sorry Pluto) named Persephone. She's searching for Thomas, a fellow astronaut who got separated from her at the start of the game. The duo are surveying the plant to see whether it's habitable after humans mucked up Earth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZs_IthEb2s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZs_IthEb2s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of gameplay, not much is shown in the trailer. Presumably, the game will have a focus on story and choices like past Don't Nod titles, but the trailer suggests platforming (and falling) will be a regular part of the experience as well. The ending of the trailer teases some sort of alien or otherworldly element, likely one that's dangerous to both Ariane and Thomas--the description beneath the trailer describes "shifting realities."</p><p>Aphelion is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in 2026.</p>
