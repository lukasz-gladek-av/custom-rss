                <p>In the latest blow to the video game labor community, Electronic Arts has confirmed layoffs at Apex Legends developer Respawn and the cancellation of two "incubation" projects at the studio. About 100 people at Respawn have been affected by the changes, a report said.</p><p>More widely, EA is making cuts that affect many people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb said</a>. EA Sports FC and Apex Legends underperformed, leading to this latest wave of cuts at EA, GameSpot understands. Dragon Age: The Veilguard might not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/">performed up to EA's sales expectations</a>, but we understand its performance is not related to the cuts across EA generally.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-believe-those-titanfall-3-rumors-youve-heard/1100-6530730/" data-ref-id="1100-6530730">skunkworks project from Titanfall veteran Steve Fukuda</a> is not going ahead within Respawn, Grubb added, and "there is no Titanfall 3." That shouldn't come as a surprise, though, as Titanfall 3 was never a sure thing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1917273189001974166" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That Steve Fukuda project is in the bin. Laying off a ton of people. There is no Titanfall 3 -- as this should make clear. <br>I don't think people realize just how much EA Football Club and Apex Legends missed last year. Dragon Age isn't even a factor compared to those two. <a href="https://t.co/lqDw5nCK97" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/lqDw5nCK97</a></p>  â€” Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1917273189001974166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-lays-off-unknown-number-of-individuals-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo first seen by IGN</a> states that EA made the decision to "step away from two early-stage incubation projects" at Respawn, along with making "targeted team adjustments" across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi. One of the game cancellations was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-and-titanfall-studio-appears-to-cancel-unannounced-fps/1100-6529955/" data-ref-id="1100-6529955">multiplayer FPS that we first heard about earlier this year.</a></p><p>Respawn itself confirmed the changes in a memo posted online. In the statement, Respawn said it is a studio that embraces "bold ideas" and "creative risks," but they don't always pan out.</p><p>"Our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged," Respawn said.</p><p>EA said it is offering "meaningful support" to affected staffers.</p><p>People affected by the layoffs at Respawn include staffers working in publishing, QA, and members of the Star Wars Jedi and incubation teams, IGN reported.</p><p>Respawn will continue to develop more content for Apex Legends and build the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-to-develop-final-game-in-star-wars-jedi-trilogy-says-ea/1100-6526559/" data-ref-id="1100-6526559">next Star Wars: Jedi game</a>, but EA declined to confirm if any incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p>For a long time already, EA management had signaled problems for Apex Legends. CEO Andrew Wilson said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">"not headed in the direction that we have wanted."</a> The executive also has talked about plans for something called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">"Apex 2.0."</a></p><p>Respawn said it wants to expand "what Apex can be," with developers continue to refine gameplay and "bring new ideas to upcoming seasons." Respawn added that it wants to "push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition, creativity, and integrity that our community expects."</p><p>As for the Star Wars: Jedi team, Respawn said the next entry in the series aims to "raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay."</p><p>In February 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">EA laid off around 670 people</a>, which was about 5% of its global workforce. The new round of cuts across EA are said to be "similar" to that round of layoffs in 2024, Grubb said, though the exact number is unclear. EA is making these reported changes just ahead of its next investor briefing on May 6.</p><p>The new changes at Respawn come at a time of uncertainty in general in the economic market for most companies due in part to Trump's scattered tariff policies and other factors. Leading global bank JP Morgan says <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/recession-probability" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the risk of a global recession stands at around 60%.</a></p>

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to name just a few--Evil Dead: The Game was first revealed at the 2020 Game Awards. After being delayed beyond its initial planned launch date of 2021, the game arrived in 2022 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, and it scooped up generally favorable reviews. Post-launch support for the game included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-splatter-royale-update-launch-trailer/2300-6460548/">Splatter Royale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-adds-army-of-darkness-update-update-with-new-map-exploration-mode-and-more/1100-6505459/">Army of Darkness</a> updates, and on console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-game-of-the-year-edition-launch-trailer/2300-6461252/">Game of the Year Edition</a> was released</p><p>"Evil Dead: The Game is faithful, but sometimes to a fault. If there were more game modes or even more varied objectives in its one attractive game mode, it would feel more like a game for horror fans to play for a long time, maybe even moving competitors like Dead By Daylight or Hunt Showdown off their vaunted pedestals," Mark Delaney wrote In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/evil-dead-the-game-review-somewhat-groovy/1900-6417881/">Evil Dead: The Game review</a>.</p><p>Like the monsters constantly tormenting Evil Dead protagonist Ash Campbell, the IP regularly shows up in new forms. One of the more recent examples is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/retrorealms-review-a-new-horror-multiverse-is-born/1900-6418302/">RetroRealms by developer WayForward</a>, as this gaming hub allowed players to grab Campbell's boomstick and take on the Deadites in a 2D platformer inspired by 16-bit classics.</p>

                <p>EA Javelin, the newly revealed name for the kernel-level PC anticheat currently used in 14 EA games including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a>, has prevented 33 million cheat attempts since its launch in 2022, with recent updates cutting the number of cheaters players encounter in Battlefield 2042 in half, according to EA.</p><p dir="ltr">While EA's push into new anticheat software for its games began in 2022 with the launch of FIFA 23, there's been little news about its impact since then. Now, EA is sharing more details on its efforts and has even given its software a new name: <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Javelin</a>, one it said was chosen to communicate defense, strength, and agility in the face of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">In a newly published progress <a href="https://www.ea.com/security/news/anticheat-progress-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a>, EA head of game security Elise Murphy said EA Javelin Anticheat has blocked 33 million cheating attempts across 2.2 billion PC gaming sessions since its 2022 launch. She said the software currently sports a 99% accuracy rate when it comes to identifying and banning cheaters, and that on the off chance it bans someone unjustly, EA has overturned those bans.</p><p dir="ltr">"We take player disputes very seriously as we never want to impact a legitimate player's ability to play one of our games," Murphy said.</p><p dir="ltr">New features introduced to EA Javelin last fall in Battlefield 2042 look to have had a big impact as well. Murphy said the game's "match infection rate"--how often a regular player would encounter a cheater--was cut in half following the new updates to EA Javelin.</p><p dir="ltr">Murphy used the report to try and ease some concerns players may have over EA Javelin's kernel-level approach, one that is also used by Riot Games' Vanguard and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">Activision's Ricochet anticheat</a> systems.</p><p dir="ltr">"While having a kernel driver is essential to protecting fair play in our games, we also understand the concerns that a kernel driver can raise," Murphy said. "EA Javelin Anticheat only runs when one of our protected games is running, and it will uninstall itself if you have uninstalled all of your EA games that have EA Javelin Anticheat protection. We have partnered closely with internal teams and 3rd party assessors to validate that EA Javelin Anticheat will only inspect what it needs to for anti-cheat purposesâ€¦everything else is off-limits."</p><p dir="ltr">Though EA has been relatively quiet on its anticheat efforts since 2022, Murphy said it will be sharing updates and deep-dives on the subject more often going forward in the name of transparency.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red believes there's no better way to play Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition on a handheld than with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Sure, this could be seen as a shot across the bow of the Steam Deck and similar PC handhelds, but it also demonstrates the confidence the studio feels about the upcoming launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">In a new Creator's Voice video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fex9IhmnQe0">on YouTube</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of technology Charles Tremblay expressed his enthusiasm for Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2--specifically in handheld mode. "Using on the go, we have the new amazing LCD screens with the VRR support [on Switch 2], and I do think it's the best way to experience the game on the go," said Tremblay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fex9IhmnQe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fex9IhmnQe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As a fun addition, Tremblay noted that playing the RPG on Switch 2 will also be "the more cyberpunk way to play Cyberpunk [2077]." Another interesting tidbit about the game for Nintendo's upcoming hybrid console is utilizing "one of your Joy-Cons to fight with your katana," according to CD Projekt Red game director Adam Badowski. The developer previously mentioned that touchscreen controls and mouse functionality would be supported when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077 was confirmed as a Switch 2 launch title</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launch-title-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-features-dlss-support/1100-6530997/">the first Switch 2 game announced to offer DLSS support</a>, with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling being utilized in all four modes for the RPG. All of this work <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-cd-projekt-acknowledges-development-challenges/1100-6531129/">has presented "challenges" for CD Projekt Red</a>. But clearly the studio is happy with the results so far, roughly a month out from Switch 2 launching June 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-the-witcher-3-get-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-reds-lips-are-sealed/1100-6530928/">As for a Witcher 3: Wild Hunt upgrade for Switch 2</a>--since that game is already on the original Switch--CD Projekt Red says it's focused on Cyberpunk 2077 for the console currently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart/1100-6531086/">Preorders are live for Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a>, with the whole game being on the cart.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">These days Call of Duty is filled with outlandish shop bundles, including animal-themed operators, neon-colorful outfits, and characters like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. However, a wacky new operator bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is causing controversy, as some players are calling the bundle's emote a sneaky pay-to-win tactic.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the latest shop items in Call of Duty is the Cardboard Commando bundle. This includes an operator constructed out of cardboard boxes, and everything in the bundle is themed around cardboard, too. The controversy comes from the bundle's "Surprise Gift" emote, which allows you to turn into a cardboard box mid-game.</p><p dir="ltr">The emote can be seen in the clip above, as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1916567772387070072" rel="nofollow ">ModernWarzone</a>, and several comments on the video are already calling the emote a pay-to-win feature.</p><p dir="ltr">Being able to quickly conceal yourself in Call of Duty can be quite the advantage, especially in more competitive modes like Search and Destroy or Warzone's battle royale. This cardboard box is fairly large and should look out of place in most settings. The emote also only temporarily lets you disguise yourself as a box. So, while this paid emote could potentially give you a competitive edge over your opponents, it's unlikely to fool anyone who isn't a new player. Still, this is a 2,400 CoD Points ($20) bundle that probably shouldn't let you hide.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty recently had another pay-to-win bundle controversy with the game's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-include-nerf-for-terminator-skin/1100-6530740/">Terminator skin has been adjusted</a> to include better visibility, but it was a very minor visual change.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-never-guess-who-the-next-cod-operator-might-be/1100-6531191/" data-ref-id="1100-6531191">Seth Rogen may become a future Call of Duty operator</a> as part of the stoner-themed content arriving with the Season 3 Reloaded update. Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">major announcements for Season 3 Reloaded</a>, including a new weapon, Ranked Play for Warzone, and more multiplayer maps.</p>

We know that it will continue the story of the previous games, albeit with Ciri now serving as the series' protagonist, and that former hero Geralt (and his long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle) will still be around in some capacity. However, the voice artist behind The Witcher 3's Yennefer of Vengerberg has said she doesn't know yet if her character will return for the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Denise Gough, who now stars in the Star Wars series Andor as Imperial Officer Dedra Meero, wasn't sure if Yennefer would return, much less the level of progress of the game.</p><p>"I don't know any of this," Gough told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yennefer-voice-artist-doesnt-yet-know-if-shes-back-for-the-witcher-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. She also looked back at her initial signing on for the role and was confused by the process.</p><p>"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"</p><p>The sorceress Yennefer is part of The Witcher's main character trinity, along with Ciri and Geralt. Her 'complex' relationship with Geralt, is featured in numerous Witcher stories as well as a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV adaptation. In the series, she is played by actress Anya Chalotra.</p><p>Fans got their first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">in May last year</a>. The Witcher Season 4 production started a year ago, with Netflix announcing that the series will end with Season 5. The final two seasons will adapt the events from The Witcher books, Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake.</p>
