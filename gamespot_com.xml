                <p>Summer Game Fest 2026 has been announced, and there is one big change that we know about so far. The event takes place on Friday, June 5 in Los Angeles, and the show is moving to the Dolby Theatre.</p><p>The 2025 event, for comparison, was held at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California. The Dolby Theatre opened in Hollywood in 2001 and hosts the Oscars each year. It was previously known as the Kodak Theatre.</p><p>Geoff Keighley once again returns to produce Summer Game Fest 2026. Keighley runs SGF and The Game Awards, and Split Fiction writer-director Josef Fares once declared during TGA, <a href="https://google.com/search?q=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQzMTJqMGo5qAIGsAIB8QU6HXKJFs428w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"F**k the Oscars,"</a> a statement that carries a bit more resonance now with SGF changing venues to where the Oscars are held.</p><p>SGF 2026 promises a "spectacular, cross-platform showcase of what's next in video games." You can attend the event yourself by purchasing a ticket when they go on sale in Spring 2026.</p><p>As for TGA, the upcoming awards show run by Keighley will take place on Thursday, December 11 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p>In 2003, Vince Zampella and his Infinity Ward co-founders unleashed the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> after previously shepherding EA's Medal of Honor franchise. The latter never reached the heights of the former, and according to Zampella, Call of Duty would have never come into being if EA hadn't come into conflict with his team.</p><p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," said Zampella during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a>. Zampella didn't elaborate on his team's fallout with EA, but they eventually formed a lucrative partnership with Activision, which purchased Infinity Ward. Zampella left Infinity Ward in 2010 and formed Respawn Entertainment before once again partnering with EA. Now, Zampella is overseeing the Battlefront franchise, which continues this month with the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p>Zampella worked closely with Steven Spielberg on the Metal of Honor games, and Spielberg reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spielberg-wanted-to-make-a-call-of-duty-movie-but-activision-passed-heres-the-reported-reason-why/1100-6534500/" data-ref-id="1100-6534500">direct a Call of Duty movie</a> years later. During the GQ interview, Zampella noted that Ridley Scott was also interested in bringing Call of Duty to the big screen.</p><p>"Ridley Scott came in one time--who's a hero of mine--but he's not connected to games," noted Zampella. "So he'd ask these questions like, 'How do you script what happens?' ... There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p>Last month, Paramount signed a deal with Activision for <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Call of Duty movie</a>, with a potential TV series to follow. It's unclear if Hollywood will show similar interest in Battlefield, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">Battlefield 6 is already doing huge numbers on Steam</a>. Battlefield 6 also has a largely clear path before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> arrives on November 14.</p>

                <p>The creative lead steering the Assassin's Creed franchise for Ubisoft has departed the company.

      </div>
<p>In an internal email to Ubisoft staff, Vantage Studios co-CEO Christophe Derennes expressed disappointment with Côté's decision, adding that Côté "had his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future."</p><p>Côté began his two-decade-long tenure at Ubisoft in 2005 as a software engineer, accumulating credits including Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands and several Assassin's Creed games.</p><p>He led the mission design for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood before acting as a game director for Assassin's Creed 3. Côté was also the creative director for Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and he led the development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p><p>As the franchise's head, starting in 2022, Côté led the initiative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-gets-a-new-name/1100-6524281/" data-ref-id="1100-6524281">group future titles into the Animus Hub</a> for a more cohesive story experience. Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was released earlier this year, was the first game to be a part of this platform.</p><p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," an Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p><p>A recent leak suggests that the Assassin's Creed franchise will make its first foray to Nintendo Switch 2 with an Assassin's Creed Shadows port, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/" data-ref-id="1100-6535405">purportedly releasing in December</a>. In other franchise news, a report claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft axed an American Civil War-set Assassin's Creed title</a> last year due to concerns involving the current political climate in the United States.</p>
