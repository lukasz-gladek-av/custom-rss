                <p>MLB The Show 25 will be out this March, and as the first game in years to not release on day one for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">Game Pass</a>, Sony's San Diego Studio had to make the case for you to spend your money at launch. New features coming to the game this year might just do that, with the sometimes-stagnant Road to the Show mode getting a big upgrade and Diamond Dynasty ditching a system players took issue with.</p><p>Rather than complete a simple combine exercise before getting drafted by an MLB team, this year's Road to the Show mode will let you begin your career as a high-school player before making the jump to college and the pros.</p><p>Authentic amateur-level audio has been included specifically for this, such as the loud "ping" of aluminum bats and the distinct crash of a player hitting a chain-link fence. Elsewhere, "hundreds" of new gameplay animations have been added, along with a new G.O.A.T. difficulty setting and an "ambush hitting" system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G33itOzDkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0G33itOzDkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Road to the Show's progression system has also been overhauled, which Sony says gives you "more control over your player's development, including crafting Perks to your liking." With any luck, it should help your players from falling too neatly into one of a few different archetypes, as they could in years past.</p><p>Diamond Dynasty has also gotten some big changes. The Sets and Seasons system, which limited the players you could take into an online ranked match, have been removed. A new tabletop-like Diamond Quest mode and the multiplayer Weekend Classic have also been added, giving you another way to earn rewards.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, MLB The Show 25 sees the return of Storylines with The Negro Leagues Season 3. Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick is back to showcase some of the greatest baseball players of all time in an educational mode that always features some unique game situations.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 releases on March 18 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch. Preorders are live now.</p>

                <p>The lead writer of the beloved RPG Fallout: New Vegas has returned to Obsidian, but those who are hoping to see a hypothetical New Vegas 2 are going to be disappointed. On his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrgonzalez/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn profile</a>, John Gonzalez posted that he's returned to Obsidian Entertainment in a new role as creative director. Under the entry for this job, he wrote the following: "Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)"</p><p dir="ltr">Gonzalez is arguably best-known as one of the lead writers of New Vegas, but he's contributed to a number of other projects. As his LinkedIn shows, he served as narrative director on Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West at Guerrilla Games. He also worked on Tom Clancy's EndWar at Ubisoft and contributed lead narrative to Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Gonzalez is also working on a novel titled "God Mode: Single Player," which he describes as "the ultimate video game novel."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's unclear what Gonzalez is working on at Obsidian, the studio has two currently announced projects. One is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to one of the studio's biggest games, known for its signature sense of humor. The other is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-avowed-is-like-skyrim-plus-one-of-the-last-decades-best-sci-fi-movies/1100-6526088/" data-ref-id="1100-6526088">Avowed</a>, a new RPG set in the world of the studio's previous Pillars of Eternity games. Avowed releases on February 18, 2025, while The Outer Worlds 2 is set to come out sometime in 2025.</p>

And apparently, the shovel can actually be used for its most important purpose: Digging.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-update-secretly-added-shovels-to-the-game-and-players-are-trying-to-unearth-the-reason-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a player known as The_Fighter03 shared the discovery on Reddit while demonstrating that the shovel can be used to create an improvised ditch for cover. Trench warfare could be very useful in Helldivers 2's battles, assuming the player isn't killed while digging.</p><p>However, it doesn't appear that digging is an option everywhere. Players will get a POI notice if they can use the shovel. For now, players are still experimenting to learn the extent of what they can do with the shovels, including how deep they can dig and if they can create a network of trenches by working together.</p><p>Additionally, Arrowhead has announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/505067472486927858" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the next Helldivers 2 Warbond</a> is coming on February 6. Servants of Freedom will include a portable Hellbomb that can be strapped to the back of players. The Sickle is also getting an upgrade with the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, while the GP-20 Ultimatum may be the most powerful grenade launcher that the game has seen to date.

                <p>Unlike other games, it's difficult to put an exact timeframe on just how long it takes to beat a playthrough of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a>. For starters, the first couple of hours when you begin can be so daunting from a gameplay perspective, so you might spend more time reading the encyclopedia than actually playing. Another huge factor is the various difficulty settings you can apply to your playthrough, which can drastically alter the overall time it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7.</p><p>Still, we know you have questions about the game's length and we're to give you the best answer we can. So just how long does it take to beat Civ 7?</p><h2>How long it takes to beat Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437801"></a><figcaption>An end-of-game scene in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437801-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.51.02.40.png"></figure><p>The best way to measure how long a playthrough of Civ 7 takes is by counting the number of turns you do across all three ages. While this isn't a full representation of the overall game length, it does provide you with the best tool to measure your progress. And, speaking from experience, I can offer rough time estimates for the amount of turns it takes to beat a playthrough.</p><p>The number of turns it takes to get through all three ages in Civ 7 is entirely dependent on the "Game Speed" you play at. Playing on the fastest speed means it takes fewer turns to complete every age while the slowest speed takes the most turns possible. There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-difficulty-options-and-how-to-change-the-difficulty/1100-6528923/" data-ref-id="1100-6528923">four main game speeds in Civ 7</a> and, from fastest to slowest, they are Quick, Standard, Epic, and Marathon. There's also an "Online" option but that's only for multiplayer.</p><p>If you decide to play on the Standard game speed, every age takes roughly 120-160 turns to complete. The Antiquity Age, which is where the game starts, usually takes the most numbers of turns, as you'll receive more leeway to start up your settlement and get units produced. However, as you move on to the subsequent Exploration and Modern Ages, it takes fewer turns to reach the end of the age. My Antiquity Age on Standard speed took 160 turns while the Exploration Age took 150 and the Modern Age took 120. Of course, your results will vary depending on what kind of path you take.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4437800"></a><figcaption>The Antiquity Age will likely take you the most turns to complete</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4437800-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-00.50.48.65.png"></figure><p>Overall, <strong>a Standard speed playthrough of Civ 7 took me close to 35 hours to complete</strong>. This included a decent amount of encyclopedia reading and strategy when it came to individual turns, so I didn't speed through the game by any means. However, I also didn't spend minutes upon minutes agonizing over what to build or what leader to target.</p><p>On the flip side, you can expect a Quick speed playthrough to take significantly less time than a Standard speed run. <strong>My first Quick playthrough only lasted around 15 hours</strong>, with each age taking close to five hours and around 100 turns.</p><p>If you want to truly go the distance in Civ 7, playing on either Epic or Marathon speed takes dozens of hours and hundreds of turns per age. I didn't get to finish a playthrough on either speed, but the Antiquity Age ended at 300 turns on Epic and over 400 turns on Marathon. <strong>In all likelihood, you could spend over 100 hours on a single Epic or Marathon run</strong>, especially if you crank the difficulty level up and play on a large map.</p><p>Speaking of which, the map size and difficulty level also play a factor in determining how many turns and hours your playthrough takes. If you play on the smallest map size and the easiest difficulty, you can breeze through a run in 10-20 hours. However, turning everything to the max amplifies how much time you spend in Civ 7 by a significant amount.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.
