                <p>The time has come and 210 days after the initial service was supposed to shutter, Nintendo's 3DS and Wii U online servers are officially gone. The service lasted as long as it did due to the efforts of dedicated fans around the world. One final player was left by the end, with a system crash finally bringing the end of 3DS online play.</p><p>Player Fishguy6564 wasn't the only player to keep going until the curtain call, but he was certainly the most successful in terms of how long he managed to keep things going. "It's over. Rest in peace, Nintendo Network," Fishguy6564 tweeted Sunday morning along with showing his 3DS displaying an error message.</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/after-127-days-in-nintendo-server-purgatory-the-last-known-mario-kart-3ds-survivor-thinks-he-cant-be-stopped-this-could-go-on-forever/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar back in August</a>, Fishguy6564 said that he could potentially keep playing forever with the only caveat being "if the 3DS somehow gave in." Sadly, that was the foretold ending.</p><p>Fishguy wasn't the only player keeping the tracks alive. He and another fellow player, Marioiscool246, set off with a clear goal: Keep a lobby alive for as long as possible. They did this by installing a patch that "supposedly prevented the death of a lobby" by deploying two bots to race each other endlessly.</p><p>After Marioiscool246's 3DS crashed in May, Fishguy6564 kept going for almost seven months. Even back in August, he couldn't believe it lasted that long. "It sure has been a wild ride," he added.</p>
