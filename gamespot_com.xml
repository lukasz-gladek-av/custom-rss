                <p>The first teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> confirmed what fans had long suspected by depicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri as the game's new lead character</a>. Through the first three games, voice actor Doug Cockle portrayed the previous main character, Geralt of Rivia, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">he will reprise his role in the sequel</a> as well. But Cockle is far from disappointed about taking a backseat this time, and he's eager to see Ciri get the spotlight.</p><p>"I'm really excited," Cockle told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because... I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."</p><p>Cockle also related that CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">gently admonished him</a> for sharing his theories about Geralt's presence in the game.</p><p>"I was never really out of their good books," said Cockle. "All developers are like this. They want to keep their surprises and I actually didn't know anything, so I was just making guesses at things and stuff like that. And probably one of their requests was to just to stop guessing, 'Doug, you might be right. You might not be right. It doesn't matter if you are talking me. Doug, who plays Geralt, whatever you say is going to be taken as something.' So it was a very, very light slap on the wrist. It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p>Cockle is reprising his role as Geralt in Netflix's upcoming animated film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-faces-a-war-between-the-land-and-the-sea-in-the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep/1100-6528810/" data-ref-id="1100-6528810">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>. That will premiere on Netflix on February 11, while The Witcher Season 4 is expected to arrive later this year. As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">ramped up production</a> at the end of 2024, and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/age-of-pirates-captain-blood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Development on Captain Blood</a> reportedly began as far back as 2003, as Russian developer Akella planned to make a game based on a novel by author Rafael Sabatini. A game titled Captain Blood was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/22/1c-announces-e3-line-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased at E3 2004</a>, but it switched teams and restarted development multiple times before the project settled with publisher 1C Company around 2008. GameSpot even went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-blood-hands-on/1100-6192241/" data-ref-id="1100-6192241">hands-on with Captain Blood</a> around this time, already lamenting that it had "been in development for several years now." While a release was supposed to happen by 2010, it kept getting delayed and ended up never releasing due to parties involved with the game going bankrupt and other legal challenges surrounding the game.</p><p>All of that meant Captain Blood was left stuck in development hell after 2010...until now. In 2024, video game publisher SNEG Ltd. acquired the rights to Captain Blood and began working on an offical release. After one last small delay from late 2024 to 2025, we finally have a concrete release date for this action-adventure game. While we have no idea whether or not the game itself is any good, it's impressive that a game that seemed cursed to never release is finally coming out.</p><p>Captain Blood launches for PC, Steam, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 6, priced at $25.</p>

                <p>Thus far, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest gaming story of 2025, and there's barely been any definitive word on the subject aside from the announcement video earlier this month. Nintendo hasn't even disclosed any upcoming games besides <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">an apparent Mario Kart sequel</a>. Now, online retailer Newegg has kicked off another round of speculation by listing new Mario and Zelda games coming this year as well.</p><p>Newegg is selling <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop gift cards</a>, which includes a brief list of some of Nintendo's upcoming titles. Some of the games--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-trailer-shows-off-the-remasters-switch-glow-up/1100-6528711/" data-ref-id="1100-6528711">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>--were already confirmed and announced. However, putting titles down like "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, [and] a Legend of Zelda remake/remaster" is going to attract attention.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't confirmed that a new Mario game or a Zelda remake/remaster are on the way, and it's likely their inclusion here was either a mistake or guesswork. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review/1900-6416795/" data-ref-id="1900-6416795">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was one of the first big games on Switch, and it seems very probable that Nintendo will have the next AAA Mario game for Switch 2. It also stands to reason that another Legend of Zelda won't be far behind. Whether either or both projects are real and ready to arrive this year remains to be seen.</p><p>Although more information about Switch 2 will be revealed at the Nintendo Direct on April 2, the company has shared a new video that reveals <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-video-reveals-how-snappy-joy-con-removal-works/1100-6528933/" data-ref-id="1100-6528933">how the snappy Joy-Con removal works</a>. Meanwhile, a Switch developer has offered his breakdown of the Switch 2 reveal to explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-significantly-more-powerful-according-to-a-game-dev/1100-6528921/" data-ref-id="1100-6528921">the sheer power of the new system</a>. Nintendo hasn't revealed a more specific release date than 2025 for Switch 2 yet, but some are predicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">a June launch</a>.</p>

The game lets players create and personalize their own avatar the use in the games single-player and online co-op modes. The game features eight explorable regions full of puzzles to solve, creatures to catch, and gardens and homes to decorate. The island's seasons change as you play, with each season featuring its own unique quests and activities, totalling over 80 hours of content. The mobile version has proven popular with players, and the upcoming console and PC versions will give new players a chance to check out the game when it launches on March 25.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-discounted-on-launch-day/1100-6524388/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Is Discounted On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon/1100-6528683/">Last Chance To Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-ps5-reprint-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-iphone-and-android-controller-is-50-off/1100-6524903/">Backbone One iPhone And Android Controller Is 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-release-date-4k-blu-ray-preorder-amazon/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Steelbook Release Date Announced</a></li>   </ul> </div>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has shipped and BioWare is free to pour its resources into the fifth entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> series, players are naturally getting excited. But according to former executive producer Mark Darrah, it'll take some time for BioWare to really get the game development wheels turning.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE">newly released video documenting the production of Veilguard</a>. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource. It had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]," Darrah continued. "You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto [work on] Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah worked for BioWare for 23 years, so although he may not be a current employee, he does likely have a pretty good idea of the studio's inner workings. At any rate, the lack of advertising for Mass Effect 5 also suggests that the game's development is still in its infancy. It was first announced in 2020, but it's been crickets from BioWare since then.</p><p dir="ltr">"This [decision to focus on one game at a time] might be great," Darrah said of BioWare's steady, focused approach to the game's development, "Because what it means is BioWare--for really the first time ever--is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all [its] attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."</p>
