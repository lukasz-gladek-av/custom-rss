                <p>Ratchet &amp; Clank's franchise has been dormant since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/" data-ref-id="5000-513782">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> was released in 2021, but that didn't stop some fans from searching for a game that few remembered. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-clone-home/" data-ref-id="5000-28102">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Clone Home</a> was announced was announced in the mid-2000s as the follow-up to the mobile title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-going-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-24743">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Mobile</a>. Although Clone Home was canceled and never officially released, the game has finally been found and a copy has been shared online.</p><p>The Golden Bolt's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZx2Exgd8TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-long-lost-ratchet-and-clank-mobile-game-has-been-found-123008739.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Engadget</a>) has posted a video detailing the years-long search for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Clone Home. As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students "Emily" and "Super Gamer Omega Clank" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZx2Exgd8TI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZx2Exgd8TI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.</p><p>It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.</p><p>This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-dev-reveals-hidden-minigame-no-one-found/1100-6532404/" data-ref-id="1100-6532404">a hidden minigame in the title</a>. Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-pc-port-confirmed-out-in-july/1100-6514495/" data-ref-id="1100-6514495">Rift Apart was ported to PC in 2023</a>, there's no word on when or if another sequel will follow.</p>

                <p>One of the nice perks of EA Play and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which includes EA Play) are 10-hour trials for new releases from EA. It's a good way to try a game before dropping money on buying it. But the free trials are not available for <em>every </em>EA game, including the just-launched Battlefield 6.</p><p>The game launched today, October 10, and has no free trial, a spokesperson for EA confirmed to GameSpot. This is somewhat unusual, as many EA games do offer 10-hour free trials. The last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-will-have-a-10-hour-trial-for-game-pass-and-ea-play-subscribers/1100-6497656/" data-ref-id="1100-6497656">Battlefield 2042, had a free 10-hour trial for Game Pass and EA Play members, too.</a> But EA does not guarantee a free 10-hour trial for all games with EA Play. The fine print states that only "select" games get these trials.</p>

      </div>
<p>While there is no free EA Play trial, people who subscribe to EA Play Pro ($17/month) can get the $100 Phantom Edition of Battlefield 6 as part of their membership for as long as they are subscribed.</p><p>Battlefield 6 put up big numbers today on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/" data-ref-id="1100-6535370">exceeding 745,000 peak concurrent players</a>, making it one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/" data-ref-id="2900-6301">most-played games on the platform ever</a>. This represents just a fraction of the game's total audience, though, as the game is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>So far, the Battlefield 6 servers appear to be holding up against the surge in players. Players are being placed into server queues to help mitigate the demand.

                <p>Earlier this year, Discord began testing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discords-new-age-verification-requires-id-or-face-scans-for-some-users/1100-6530915/" data-ref-id="1100-6530915">a new age-verification process</a> in the United Kingdom that required users to scan their government-issued ID. That has come back to haunt both Discord and the users who shared that info, as a new report suggests that millions of people may have had their ID and other info exposed during a recent data hack.</p><p>According to a statement <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Discord's official site</a>, the government-issued ID of 70,000 users may have been exposed when a third-party service provider, 5CA, was hacked. Discord had contracted 5CA to handle age-verification duties. Discord went on to state that none of its messages were breached beyond exchanges with customer support or trust and safety agents.</p><p><a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/discord-data-breach-sensitive-data/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyber Security News</a>' follow-up report puts the number of stolen government IDs at 2.1 million, and added that the final number of affected people may be approximately "5.5 million unique users across 8.4 million support tickets."</p><p>The report adds that the hackers attempted to extort Discord with a total of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data, which potentially includes usernames, email accounts, IP addresses, and the last four digits of credit card numbers. Discord has stated that full credit card numbers and CCV codes weren't included in the breach, and added that it is working with law enforcement while notifying affected users by email.</p><p>The ID photographs of the affected users could also be leaked, which was one of the reasons the UK faced pushback over this requirement. 5CA appears to have been responsible for manual reviews for users whose IDs were initially rejected or people who were appealing age-related suspensions.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo attempted to subpoena Discord to discover the identity of a user responsible for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-trying-to-subpoena-discord-over-massive-pokemon-leak/1100-6531036/" data-ref-id="1100-6531036">a massive Pokemon leak</a>.
