                <p>The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.</p><p>According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.</p><p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said</a> some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.</p><p>The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. </p><p>"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back," center Tyler Linderbaum said. "We have 11 games left to try to run the table."</p><p>The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. </p>

                <p>In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/scarface-the-world-is-yours/" data-ref-id="5000-21399">Scarface: The World is Yours</a> was released as an alternate timeline sequel to the classic 1983 film starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. The game has been unavailable for a long time, but it's recently shown up as a pending re-release on Epic Games Store and Steam. However, no one seems to have heard of the publisher, EC Digital, and it's unclear if it's actually happening.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/a-publisher-nobodys-heard-of-has-unintentionally-re-released-2006s-scarface-the-world-is-yours-early-and-im-not-so-sure-bout-this-one-boss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Scarface: The World is Yours was accidentally released early on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, and the game page is still active. It's also listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, which included an explanation for the early release.</p><p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned. We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version," the statement reads.</p><p>Because Scarface went live prematurely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m3rcc3p2ep2j" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> and others noted that it includes two fan-made patches, SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, which make the game playable. The creator of SilentPatch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cookieplmonster.bsky.social/post/3m3rcwjmhps2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Silent</a>, notes that the patches were incorporated into this release without permission, but also acknowledges that it wasn't "necessary as per the license, but would be nice."</p><p>Attempts to reach EC Digital didn't turn up any contact info, and it's unknown if Universal sanctioned this re-release. Following the initial reports, EC Digital has shared a statement on Steam that it has asked Valve to temporarily hide the page "while we worked through ongoing licensing and technical matters."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1980996726572954007" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Updated notice on Scarface on Steam <a href="https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/b0KXtvOm5v</a><br>"We’ve recently entered urgent discussions with multiple parties concerning the project’s status.

If things change and we're able to bring the game back in the future, we'll let you know right away."</p><p>For now, this doesn't appear to be going forward.

                <p>The idea of exclusive games in 2025 is "antiquated," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. She said in a new interview that people are beginning to "evolve way past" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.</p><p>"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people," she told <a href="https://youtu.be/yDmwJ7tuoD8?si=GKqqs8S6R2L7458R" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>.</p><p>"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Rog Ally X</a>]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room," she added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="435">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=435" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.</p><p>For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.</p><p>Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-wont-be-announced-until-2026-report/1100-6535565/" data-ref-id="1100-6535565">this will be announced in 2026.</a></p><p>In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.</a></p><p>Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">"high-end"</a> and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.</p>

<p>"That's me--I play games without killing to see if it's possible," he wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oakv3h/comment/nke465l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comment</a> a few days ago on Reddit. "For anyone interested, I'm now level 42 in 25 hours, I mostly finish top 5 scores in the game, most revives in 1 life is 47, I have 40.6% of my time on objective which puts me in the top 0.2% of players."</p><p>He didn't go into detail about those eight players that fell to him, although they could have been enemy soldiers who were trying to finish off the players he was saving.</p><p>Pacifist runs have become increasingly popular in multiplayer games that give players enough freedom to make it possible. We've seen them in other shooters and battle royales like Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite where players either hide or avoid combat until the last possible moment.</p><p>ThatFriendlyGuyTTV could probably make a Battlefield 6 version of Hacksaw Ridge, a dramatic and cinematic telling of the story of Desmond Doss. He was an American combat medic who saved 75 soldiers in Okinawa without firing a single shot.</p>

  </div><p dir="ltr">As for other Sony hardware, the company reportedly stopped issuing sales figures for PS4 in 2022, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-sales-reach-117-2-million-units-as-production-winds-down/1100-6506319/#:~:text=PS4%20Sales%20Reach%20117.2%20Million%20Units%20As%20Production%20Winds%20Down%20-%20GameSpot">system sat at roughly 117 units sold</a>. The PS2 is the best-selling system of all time, with Sony producing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-ps2s-sony-made-in-its-lifetime/1100-6528175/">over 160 million consoles</a> from 2000 to 2013. There is a chance--though possibly a small one at this point--that Switch could catch up to PS2. As of August, Nintendo had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">sold more than 153 million Switch systems</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Circana shared September 2025 video game industry sales data for the US earlier today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">Borderlands 4 had the biggest launch in history for the looter-shooter series</a>, when accounting for dollar sales. Piscatella noted Borderlands 4 was performing "30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3" for launch dollar sales. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/">Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 has been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

                <p>Gadgets play a major role in whatever class you decide to use in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>. They're essentially the pieces of equipment that you spawn into every life with, and if you use them correctly, you can wreak havoc on the enemy team. Every class in Battlefield 6 offers several exclusive Gadgets for you to choose from, and while you can always stick with the default options, there are some better choices that are waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>Below, we'll go over the best Gadgets to use for the four classes in Battlefield 6 so you know exactly what to equip on your loadouts. It's worth noting that this guide pairs well with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-guns-and-weapon-loadouts-in-battlefield-6/2900-6870/" data-ref-id="2900-6870">best weapons in BF6</a> guide, naturally.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>With every class in Battlefield 6 allowing you to take two separate Gadgets, we'll be listing the top two Gadgets for each class. Some of them are unlocked by default, others are unlocked by leveling up, and some need to be unlocked through complex challenges. We made sure not to make the list consist only of gadgets you must sweat and grind for, though.</p><p>We'll go over each class and its best Gadgets below:</p><h3 id="Assault_class">Assault class</h3><p>First, we have Assault, one of the more popular classes in Battlefield 6. Assault doesn't have nearly the number of Gadgets as other classes do, but the options it does have can be game-wrecking. Here are our picks for the best Assault Gadgets:</p><ul><li>M87A1 Shotgun</li><li>Deploy Beacon</li><li>Assault Ladder</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146"></a><figcaption>The Deploy Beacon for the Assault class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png"></figure><p>While we did say that we'd only be listing two Gadgets per class, Assault is a special case. Its first Gadget slot is dedicated to actual weapons, including the all-powerful M87A1 shotgun, carbines, and other decent guns. So, to compensate for that, we're listing two other Gadgets you can use in the second slot.</p><p>The Gadgets we've gone with are the Deploy Beacon and the Assault Ladder. The Deploy Beacon is extremely useful for flanking enemies and squadding up with your teammates, while the Assault Ladder can be used for a variety of reasons, including forgoing the need for stairs to reach a second-level building.</p><h3 id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h3><p>Next up is Engineer, and it has access to some of the most varied and useful Gadgets in the entire game. As this class's goal is to take out vehicles, you'll find a slew of rocket launchers and other anti-vehicle equipment in the Gadgets section. Here's our picks for the best overall Engineer Gadgets:</p><ul><li>RPG-7V2</li><li>Supply Crate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151"></a><figcaption>The RPG-7V2 for the Engineer class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png"></figure><p>The RPG-7V2 is our choice for the best rocket launcher Gadget you can use for the Engineer class. The rockets are unguided and can be fired relatively fast, making them perfect for taking out ground vehicles quickly. You can also hit some incredible clips if you manage to destroy a helicopter or jet with an RPG shot.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the Supply Crate. Not only can this help solve the ammunition problem for your teammates in Battlefield 6, but it also allows you to constantly reload a vehicle's weapons without the need for the vehicle to visit a dedicated resupply station on the map.</p><h3 id="Support_class">Support class</h3><p>Support is far and away the most team-friendly class in Battlefield 6, and one of its Gadget slots is essentially filled before you even enter a match for the first time. If you've played Support, you know what Gadget we're talking about. As for the other slot, though, check out our pick for that Gadget below:</p><ul><li>Defibrillator</li><li>M320A1 SMK</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152"></a><figcaption>The Defibrillator for the Support class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png"></figure><p>The Defibrillator is basically a package deal with the Support class. It allows you to revive teammates instantly and can be used as a backup melee weapon if need be. You might as well not run Support if you're not going to use the Defibrillator.</p><p>The M320A1 SMK is our other Gadget pick for Support. This allows you to throw several smokescreens on the ground, allowing your team to reposition and not get picked off from a distance by snipers. You'll also clear any markers from enemies when you or a teammate runs into the smoke. This Gadget can replace a Smoke Grenade, but using the two together is even more powerful.</p><h3 id="Recon_class">Recon class</h3><p>Finally, there's the Recon class. This class is mostly reserved for sniper rifle players, as snipers are given massive advantages when running Recon. Whether you're using a sniper or not, though, you'll want these Gadgets on your loadout:</p><ul><li>Recon Drone</li><li>AP Mine</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153"></a><figcaption>The AP Mine for the Recon class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png"></figure><p>The Recon Drone might seem controversial for your first Gadget slot. While it won't impact your gameplay too much, it really helps out your team, as you can mark enemies continually as long as your drone doesn't get shot down. The Recon Drone also grants you incredible XP, which is hard to come by in Battlefield 6. If you're using a sniper, you can use the drone to scout out potential targets as well.</p><p>Our second pick is the AP Mine, which is basically a claymore that you can put down behind you as you set up in a cozy spot with your sniper or long-range weapon. As long as you place the mine in a hidden spot where enemies will run into it if they try to flank you, you're guaranteed a kill.</p><p>Use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">Battlefield 6 guides hub</a> for lots more help on EA's massive shooter.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> has been a welcome surprise from developer Sloclap, which repurposed the acrobatic movement and target tracking of martial-arts-inspired fighters <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/absolver/" data-ref-id="5000-454945">Absolver</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a> to make a cooperative third-person soccer "shooter" game. Rematch is currently in the midst of the first season of its live-service run, which implemented tons of bug fixes and the long-requested Ranked 3v3 mode. One of the most requested features still remains absent, however. Since the game launched, players have clamored for Rematch to have a "rematch" button so that teams can try to get revenge on an opponent. And while the feature isn't coming this season (and may not ever happen), Sloclap is aware of the desire, and it's working on it.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not in any way going to commit to it, but [a rematch button] was originally planned for Season 2 and now it's more likely planned for Season 3," Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno told me. "The first thing is to work on a 'team up' button. I want to be able to say, 'Those were cool teammates. I enjoyed playing with those guys. There was not any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-did-not-take-inspiration-from-blue-lock/1100-6532728/">Blue Lock fan roleplaying as a Neo Egoist</a>.' Being able to say to those guys that you want to team up and be a group together is what we're working on first."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The team is still working on adjustments to the moment-to-moment of gameplay as well. Tarno spoke to how tricky fine-tuning Rematch's mechanics are because every change is immediately evident to all players: a problem not evident in most live-service games.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every interaction [in Rematch] has the potential to determine the actual outcome of the game, and you [need to] factor in the fact that everybody's always watching," Tarno said. "Because contrary to other games, you've got 10 players on a flat field looking at the same point all the time."</p><p dir="ltr">Tarno compared this to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> where each interaction during a match is largely unseen. If you're in a firefight and think an aspect of it is unfair, your issue is largely private to you. These games have huge maps with tall walls and enclosed spaces, dividing every aspect of every match into several separate interactions. But in Rematch, anything that happens to one player in a match is seen by every other player in the match. Small tweaks to how a mechanic works become immediately apparent.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589412-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589412-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589412"></a><figcaption>Season 1 adds new battle passes filled with cosmetics themed around hot and cold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589412-re2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"If your tackle seems to go through but doesn't, and you're like, 'I am sure that this tackle should have gone through,' [and] all other players can see that it should have," Tarno said. "And that puts a very, very high bar [on] our execution."</p><p dir="ltr">This is partially why Season 1 doesn't take any huge swings to how Rematch works mechanically, but larger changes are coming as Sloclap grows accustomed to what players want from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, we want to take into account players' habits and what they've gotten used to, but if we feel that something is needed and that needs a strong evolution, we'll take that step," Tarno said. "An example is something that is [being] planned for [but] probably [isn't coming until] like March: volley contacts. That's how we resolve situations where two people are going for volley action on the same ball."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589413-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589413-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589413"></a><figcaption>The hit boxes on slide tackles still feels a bit off.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589413-re3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Rematch, a volley action is a reaction you can take when the ball is approaching you through the air and is just entering your reach. These include actions like a header, back-heel pass, and Rematch's most acrobatic kicks. They're a major part of the game, but seemingly, at the moment, there is no concrete ruling in place as to which player gets priority if two or more players are attempting a volley action simultaneously.</p><p dir="ltr">"<a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-5-patch-notes-1-201-100" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Patch 5</a>, which is [out now], will already refine the [volley action] system by adding priorities to the one who is closer to the ball's trajectory," Tarno said. "But that's not sufficient. It's a necessary change for now--it will probably improve fairness in a lot of situations--but it also probably amplifies what the high-level players call the missile meta, which is having a main tactic of [delivering] a long cross to the penalty area and hoping that your attacker will get the priority on the ball and probably a shot on the goal."</p><p dir="ltr">To avoid making the missile meta the go-to tactic and ensure players are further encouraged to adapt and evolve and develop new strategies, the Sloclap team wants to further iterate on the volley system in future patches, putting priority on certain actions and player placement that go beyond who is closest to the ball. A version of this sort of already exists in Rematch--the goalkeeper's lunges and dives have priority over all other actions, grabbing and picking up the ball no matter its speed or angle if the goalkeeper positions themselves correctly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589414-re4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589414-re4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589414"></a><figcaption>Rematch Season 1 has been focused on getting players passing, not playing solo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589414-re4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Following Patch 5, Rematch is scheduled to get one more major update for Season 1: a brand-new mode. "The two core, most popular game modes today are Ranked 5v5 and 3v3, but I think very engaged players also want a--I don't like the word, but--palette cleansing. Something that makes them go, 'I'm going to jump in something else, refresh, and have a different approach [for the next match]. The new mode's challenges are a bit different."</p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "I think it's a welcome change. I appreciate [how it will] toy at the heart of the game, which is your character and how you manipulate them and how they interact with the ball. And without spoiling too much, the vision behind [the new mode] is reinforcing team play and passing the ball within the team. And, hopefully, it will improve your passes and improve your vision, like, 'Where are my teammates? Where should I pass to them?' and hopefully this will translate to the main game and incentivize players to pass more."</p><p dir="ltr">After the release of that new mode, the Sloclap team will be totally focused on Season 2 and everything scheduled to come to the game in 2026. A lot of the changes coming are inspired by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a>, the game often used in comparison with Rematch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589415-re5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589415" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589415-re5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589415"></a><figcaption>The Sloclap team is working on changes to volley actions.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589415-re5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We've actually started designing new callouts," Tarno told me. "There's the voice recording stuff, so it won't be coming until like Season 2, but we're probably going to orient ourselves towards a kind of communication system similar to Rocket League."</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, in Rematch, there are only four callouts: Good Job, We Got This, Sorry, and Thank You. Rocket League has dozens of callouts and you can program which 16 you want to use at a time, allowing you to react to a lot more of the match than what you can do in Rematch. I've wanted Rematch to blatantly copy this aspect of Rocket League since day one, if for no other reason than to have an option of saying "Nice Pass" to a teammate who perfectly sets me up for the goal I just made. I can't say Good Job. I--and so many other Rematch players--use Good Job to sarcastically condemn people who mess up. And Sloclap knows this is what the community uses Good Job for. Their team members use it in the exact same way.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think we'll probably introduce negative stuff in [the new callouts], like being able to say You Should Have Passed or stuff like that," Tarno said. "Because if you don't do that, players will continue to use what should be positive options from the existing comms in a passive-aggressive way."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589416-re6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589416-re6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589416"></a><figcaption>It's been months and Rematch is still one of my favorite games to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4589416-re6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also like Rocket League, Rematch will be getting leaver penalties and a forfeit-match option in the future. "I think there will be multiple patches for that," Tarno said. "The first one, which we'll introduce quite soon, is a leaver penalty in terms of if you leave during the game, you're not allowed to matchmake for X number of minutes, which hopefully stops players [from just leaving] when they're losing 2-0, and there's still four minutes on the clock and you can 100% still come back. And then, probably also as Rocket League does it, introducing a forfeit option. If you're losing 3-0 and there's one minute left on the clock, maybe you could collectively say, 'Okay guys, let's call it quits.' But that's a little further down the line."</p><p dir="ltr">Rematch is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
