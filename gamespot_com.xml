                <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 23, 2015. Below, we look at how it raised the bar for not only superhero games, but for the third act in video game trilogies.</i></p><p dir="ltr">There's an old adage that good things come in threes, and that's an idea that applies perfectly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. Rocksteady's final chapter in its Caped Crusader saga turned 10 years old this week, and it's still a masterpiece of superhero action that has stood the test of time. There's a lot to love about the game, from its dark storyline to its shocking twists--the Arkham Knight was a <em>red hood herring</em>--and more, but the lasting legacy of the game is that it solved the problem of video game trilogies a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s a familiar scenario: You fire up the third game in a beloved series, ready to be wowed. It’s good. You're having fun. But you can’t shake the feeling that you’ve done it all before. "More of the same" is a common criticism against video game trilogies' final chapters--but it's one Arkham Knight skillfully sidestepped.</p><p dir="ltr">If Arkham Asylum laid the foundation, then Arkham City was the stately Wayne Manor built atop it--bigger, bolder, and more refined. But by the time Arkham Knight came around, there were fears of fatigue. It followed the release of Batman: Arkham Origins in 2013 by Warner Bros. Montreal, which wasn't part of Rocksteady's trilogy but received considerably less acclaim. Could Rocksteady keep the momentum going?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It did--by pushing every idea of its Batman to the extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Arkham Knight is a finely tuned power fantasy built on three pillars: detective work, stealth, and bone-crunching combat. One moment you’re reconstructing crime scenes with high-tech forensic tools; the next, you’re a silent predator stalking armed militia; and then you're diving into balletic brawls that stitch gadgets and combos into a brutal symphony of chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">At this stage, Rocksteady trusted players to know how to be Batman. And in return, it gave them the tools to break past the limits of earlier games. Combat flowed with graceful brutality as you weaved through enemies using freeze grenades, shock rounds, and precision counters. In stealth segments, the fear mechanic hit new highs, as nothing quite matched the rush of trapping a squad of militants with a smoke bomb cloud and then quickly eliminating them one by one using new gameplay mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">But the game didn't just empower players--it challenged them. With the Arkham Knight and his private army escalating the threat level, players had to evolve. Rocksteady walked the razor’s edge between power fantasy and overpower fantasy, and never lost its balance along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then there was the Batmobile. What if Batman were a car? That’s the question Rocksteady answered by transforming Gotham’s most iconic vehicle into a game-changing mechanic. Not just a way to move across the city, the Batmobile became an extension of the Dark Knight himself--solving puzzles, charging into battles, and even taking on tanks. There's something surreal and satisfying about sneaking up on Deathstroke’s armored convoy in a 1,200bhp crime-fighting machine that could somehow still meet strict European noise-pollution requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Batman: Arkham Knight <em>is </em>more of the same, but pushed to its absolute extreme. It's a fitting finale to the Arkhamverse--especially if you choose to ignore Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League--and a celebration of Batman that still shines a decade later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to grab the game and celebrate its anniversary, then now is a great time to do so. The Arkham Knight Premium Edition regularly sells for an absurdly low price--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=10+Years+Ago%2C+Batman%3A+Arkham+Knight+Solved+The+Video+Game+Trilogy+Problem&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A18&amp;fnarticle_id=6532637&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Standard+Feature&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbatman_arkham_knight_premium_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F10-years-ago-batman-arkham-knight-solved-the-video-game-trilogy-problem%2F1100-6532637%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">GOG has a DRM-free version for just $6</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/">2025 Summer Sale</a>--and it's incredibly good value for money. Not only do you get the base game, but there’s a Batcave of DLC to dig into that ranges from challenge maps to standalone episodes focusing on Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've picked up a Switch 2, the game has also been substantially improved on the Nintendo platform as part of the Arkham Trilogy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE41LJyXh0"> According to Digital Foundry</a>, it's not entirely perfect, but it does run at a locked and mostly stable 30fps when compared to the sluggish performance on the original Switch.</p>

                <p>The veil shrouding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming Midnight expansion is set to be lifted at Gamescom 2025, with Blizzard confirming news and updates at the show about the next chapter in the game's Worldsoul Saga trilogy.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced fans can expect "exclusive news and updates" about Midnight "directly from the development team, along with a few additional surprises" during the five-day show in Cologne, Germany that runs August 20-24.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It isn't much to go on, but Blizzard has in recent years used Gamescom for major announcements. Blizzard revealed the release date for the game's current The War Within expansion at Gamescom 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase, for example. While it's still unclear if Midnight will be released this year, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard gave it a definitive release date at the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much is currently known about Midnight. Blizzard announced an entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">trilogy of expansions back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, including Midnight, but only revealed a handful of details about what the expansions beyond The War Within would entail. In Midnight's case, it will see players revisit the homeland of the Blood Elves, Quel'thalas, as they look to stop the forces of the Void from claiming the Sunwell.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the "additional surprises" Blizzard has in store, it's hard to imagine more information about player housing, and a possible release date for the feature, aren't among them. Player housing is easily the most anticipated feature in the MMORPG's 20-year-history, and Blizzard has already teased that it will be coming ahead of Midnight proper, either as part of the expansion's pre-patch update or possibly even sooner. We came away impressed after a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a> decoration tools, stating that even the early test version we played felt loaded with endless possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still plenty to tide WoW players over in the meantime. Blizzard recently revealed what's coming in The War Within's major 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>. The update will introduce the largest raid boss in WoW history as well as asynchronous multiplayer features for Delves that definitely feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">inspired by From Software's Dark Souls series</a>. Players are additionally convinced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Blizzard is teasing a new Demon Hunter specialization</a>--one that could also make for a nice Gamescom surprise.</p>

                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

At Borderlands Fan Fest, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford and chief creative officer Randy Varnell were on stage to reveal more details about the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-shows-off-the-sinister-timekeeper-and-claptrap/1100-6532590/">following the debut of a new story trailer</a> that put the spotlight on the sinister Timekeeper.</p><p>"You'll find more skills per character than in Borderlands 3 and 2 added together, it's a lot of complexity and depth per character," Pitchford said. "We're working late on Fridays for you," he added.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Varnell, the skill trees are so varied that players could take the same character and action skill into a fight and still be able to fulfill different roles in a firefight. This is a big departure from Borderlands 3, where action skills were generally tied to certain playstyles and didn't offer much room for improvisation.</p><p>As for the overall numbers, players could be looking at a very in-depth system for all the skills they can play around with. For example, Borderlands 2 had up to 10 skills per skill tree for each character, while Borderlands 3 offered four skill trees and up to 20 skills for each one across various tiers. A lot of these skills focused on buffing characters when certain actions were performed, with reduced ability cooldowns, rapid healing, and action-skill enhancements being offered for the right build.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with the standard version of the game priced at $70.
