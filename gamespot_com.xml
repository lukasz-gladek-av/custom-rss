                <p>Artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games and beyond, and now the top boss at GTA parent company Take-Two has chimed in with his thoughts. Strauss Zelnick said in an interview that artificial intelligence will be embraced as a digital tool to assist humans and that employment numbers will go up long-term as a result.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron; there's no such thing. Machine learning... machines don't learn," he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>He added: "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that history has shown time and again that the arrival of new digital technologies ultimately leads to further job creation, increased productivity, and increased GPD overall. "I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI," he said.</p><p>Others in the video game space, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a>, have admitted that advancements to AI will lead to job losses in the short term while increasing employment rates on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said Take-Two's efforts in the AI space will not infringe on other people's intellectual properties, as some have been accused of already. OpenAI, for example, is being <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sued by The New York Times</a> over claims that the AI company used its data to train its large language model. "So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own," he said.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>.</p><p>Video game voice actors remain on strike over concerns around AI, among other things. One of the more prominent voice actors, Jennifer Hale, has discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why she believes AI is an "existential" threat.</a></p>

                <p>A new report on Monolith's Wonder Woman video game has emerged, claiming that the project has undergone a reboot behind the scenes and has so far cost Warner Bros. over $100 million.

procedural storytelling in its design. Warner Bros. executives reportedly weren't interested in this proposal, and three years later, the project was canceled. The executives suggested that Monolith should instead work on one of the company's franchises, and after the departure of studio head Kevin Stephens and several key creatives--who would go on to form a new studio at EA to work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">Black Panther game</a>--the rest of Monolith began development on the Wonder Woman game.</p><p>Schrier's report says that an early version of the game attempted to reimagine the Nemesis system from the Mordor games, allowing Wonder Woman to befriend her enemies. This idea was eventually scrapped "in favor of a more traditional action-adventure game" and the future of the project might be in jeopardy.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-teased-during-the-game-awards-from-monolith/1100-6498851/">The Game Awards in 2021</a>, but since then, the studio has kept quiet on development aside from confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-isnt-live-service-despite-recent-job-listing/1100-6519317/">it will not be a live-service title</a>. Reports of a troubled development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-reportedly-having-troubled-development/1100-6523971/">first began cropping up last year</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend at Warner Bros. Games, as recent projects have failed to take off. Rocksteady's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301"> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a $200 million flop</a> for the company, Warner Bros. Montreal's Gotham Knights saw lukewarm sales when it launched, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus will shut down in May</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two has supported Nintendo platforms over the years, and the company expects that to continue with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. This comes just days after another high-profile publisher, EA, said something similar, indicating the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/" data-ref-id="1100-6529253">Madden series may show up on Switch 2.</a></p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/take-two-earnings-stock-price-0c8df088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Barron's</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he's not ready to make any announcements, but fans can expect reveals to come. "Historically, we've supported Nintendo platforms selectively; we've supported them when the platform is right for the property at hand," Zelnick said. "We haven't made any announcements, but I think you can expect it will be supportive when it makes sense."</p><p>During an earnings call, Zenick said there was a time when Nintendo platforms were aimed nearly exclusively at kids and young people in general, but that's no longer the case. The Switch can "support any audience" today, Zelnick said, stopping short of specifically confirming any game releases for Switch 2.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/take-two-ceo-bullish-on-his-games-but-wary-on-tariffs-strauss-zelnick/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Zelnick said, "I would have every belief that we'll be supportive of Switch 2."</p><p>People might want to know if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI </a>will show up on Switch 2, and there is no reason to believe it will. The game has only been announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive/" data-ref-id="5000-539473">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> came to Switch in 2021. Before that, Rockstar released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-chinatown-wars/" data-ref-id="5000-38075">GTA: Chinatown Wars</a> on Nintendo DS back in 2009.</p><p>Outside of Rockstar Games, there are plenty of 2K Games franchises that could potentially show up on Switch 2, but no announcements have been made. Recently, developers at Civilization studio Firaxis commented on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/" data-ref-id="1100-6529219">Switch 2's rumored mouse controls and how that could be "intriguing" for the series.</a></p><p>In other Take-Two news, the company has re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">GTA VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025</a>, despite fears it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">could be delayed like many of Rockstar's past games were.</a></p>

                <p>Ahead of its full release on February 11, Civilization VII developer Firaxis has outlined plans to improve the game with post-launch fixes and new features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-early-reviews-suggest-a-divisive-experience/1100-6529191/" data-ref-id="1100-6529191">Early reviews for Civilization VII have been mixed so far</a>, while Steam community feedback posts have also highlighted several areas that need to be addressed.</p><p>In a developer update, Firaxis revealed that its primary focus is on the user interface, as it wants to make this part of the game easier to use and read. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," Firaxis explained in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>. "We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can."</p><p>Firaxis will also be working on implementing several features requested by the community, adding these in via free future updates. While the timing for these has yet to be worked out, the developer says that Civilization VII fans can expect to see the following features added in time:</p><ul><li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so that you can play cooperatively</li><li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to the Distant Lands system</li><li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single- or double-Age games</li><li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li><li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li><li>Hotseat multiplayer</li></ul><p>The studio added that is aiming to release Patch 1.1.0 in March, which includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, and additional bug fixes. Currently available in early access on PC, Civilization VII will also be coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><p>The game is also expected to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 via backwards compatibility</a>, and with rumors of the updated Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like functionality, Civilization VII executive producer Dennis Shirk recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/">commented that such a feature is quite intriguing</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has very good reasons to feel bullish this year, as his company is poised to release potential blockbusters like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-trailer-and-release-date-leak-ahead-of-reveal/1100-6528413/" data-ref-id="1100-6528413">Mafia: The Old Country</a> However, the prospect of President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs has cast a pall over the video game industry. During a recent interview, Zelnick noted that he's not afraid of the tariffs hurting game sales, but video game consoles may not be as lucky.</p><p>"I'm not sure it would affect physical discs," Zelnick told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/take-two-ceo-bullish-on-his-games-but-wary-on-tariffs-strauss-zelnick/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>. "I do think the tariffs could be a negative for console sales. As an economist, I'm not a big fan of trade wars. I do think there are moments where tariffs make sense. I'm encouraged by the pause in Mexico and Canada. But I'm a free trader so generally speaking I don't think tariffs are the right way to build or tax an economy."</p><p>As mentioned by Zelnick, the tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada were paused for 30 days--but not canceled. Additionally, Trump has already ordered a 10% tariff increase on goods from China on top of the tariffs that were already in place. In 2020, the video game industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-xbox-series-x-wont-be-impacted-by-trumps-tarif/1100-6473108/" data-ref-id="1100-6473108">successfully lobbied Trump to exclude it</a> from his planned tariffs. No such guarantee exists this time.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association recently shared a statement warning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-warns-trump-tariffs-could-harm-the-video-game-industry/1100-6529197/" data-ref-id="1100-6529197">the impact of Trump's tariffs</a> could devastate video game sales and urged the President to work with the industry to find a better solution. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella has also warned of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">a significant drop in physical game discs</a> brought in from Mexico if the proposed tariffs on that country go through. There's also the very real possibility that any additional tariffs will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">spike the prices of both video games and consoles</a>.</p>
