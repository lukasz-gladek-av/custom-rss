                <p>Microsoft has been bringing more of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games to PlayStation 5</a>, but one major title still missing from the list is Bethesda's Starfield. For PS5 players that were hoping to play Starfield on the console this year, that won't be happening just yet.</p><p>However, that may change next spring, a new rumor suggests. According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, sources familiar with the situation indicate that Starfield won't be released on PS5 in 2025. One of the reasons is the lower-than-expected performance of its first expansion, Shattered Space. Microsoft is now looking at a Spring 2026 release for the PS5 version, possibly alongside the game's second expansion and a set of quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>Although it hasn't been officially announced for PS5 yet, Microsoft's recent push toward releasing more games on multiple platforms suggests it's only a matter of time. The company has made it clear that it's open to expanding its reach, so Starfield coming to PS5 seems inevitable--even if the exact timing is still uncertain.</p><p>The next Xbox game heading to PS5 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-big-xbox-published-games-are-getting-ps5-exclusive-physical-editions/1100-6532423/" data-ref-id="1100-6532423">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, set for release on August 26. Other titles likely to follow--still unconfirmed--include Gears of War: E‑Day and State of Decay 3, based on similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-collection-set-for-ps5-this-year-e-day-releasing-in-2026-report/1100-6529840/" data-ref-id="1100-6529840">reports</a>. While Starfield’s first expansion <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received mixed reviews</a>, the base game still earned mostly favorable grades. GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">praised its scale and side quests</a> but criticized its shallow RPG systems and overall polish.</p>
