                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: Mists of Pandaria Classic will launch July 21, Blizzard has announced, and there will be a new way to get brought up to speed for those who haven't played some of the game's previous Classic expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has long sold WoW character boosts, and in WoW Classic, started selling them ahead of the arrival of The Burning Crusade Classic. The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>. While still featuring modern WoW's gameplay, the event saw players make new characters and speedrun through Mists of Pandaria content with faster leveling speeds, powerful gems that triggered additional effects in combat, and new limited-time rewards like mounts and armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">WoW's next remix event will be for the popular Legion expansion</a> later this year. Meanwhile, WoW's long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing system</a> is still on track to arrive as part of its Midnight expansion.

                <p>It's a big day for Ubisoft's The Division 2, as the game has joined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> library alongside the debut of its new expansion, Battle for Brooklyn.</p><p>The Division 2 is available via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. People who subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate get a perk in the form of the free EMS outfit, which itself includes five EMS-themed items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S65EIG8H3Z4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S65EIG8H3Z4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Division 2 comes to Game Pass just as the game's seventh year of live service begins with the Year 7 Crossroads update. This season is all about nostalgia, with new modifiers and gear that are callbacks to the original The Division, Ubisoft said. Year 7 also includes a range of quality-of-life improvements, including better onboarding for new players.</p><p>The Division 2 is also included in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/" data-ref-id="1100-6531805">PlayStation Plus Extra catalog</a>, while Ubisoft+ subscribers can get it through their membership as well.</p><p>Additionally, the Battle for Brooklyn expansion is out now, taking players to Brooklyn as part of a "brand-new linear campaign." The campaign can be completed solo or in co-op, and the story involves learning how the Cleaners have cooked up their dangerous Purple Flame weapon.</p><p>Everyone who buys the $15 Battle for Brooklyn expansion gets an automatic level-40 boost, along with the DLC-exclusive Catalyst Exotic mask that provides special in-game bonuses. Battle for Brooklyn is also included in The Division 2's Gold and Ultimate editions.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the second crossover, it's with indie sensation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a>. A Balatro-inspired trinket for Naoe and an amulet for Yasuke, both called "Winning Hand," have been added via the update. The items sport a legendary perk that has a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders. Ubisoft, however, isn't simply giving aways the new item. The patch notes state players will need to "work together to figure out how to get it" but doesn't offer any other clues, so let the hunt begin.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side of things, update 1.0.5 brings some welcome improvements to the Assassin's Creed Shadows' parkour. A new vertical jump option has been added, allowing players to jump up to nearby ledges or awnings without having to wall-run. Other additions include the option to make it so sprint no longer disengages when parkouring up or down, as well as enhanced distance and height for back and side ejects, making it easier for Naoe to keep to the rooftops.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from bug fixes, the other major additions via update 1.0.5 are new photo mode features (like the ability to change the time of day and toggle headgear on or off). Assassin's Creed Shadows' preorder quest, Thrown to the Dogs, is now also unlocked for all players, and revolves around helping a loyal canine companion avenge his master. Completing the quest unlocks the Tsuki-maru pet that can be placed in the game's hideout. The full Assassin's Creed Shadows patch notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.0.5 is just the latest addition to Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft having already detailed what's next for the open-world RPG as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>. An Assassin's Creed Shadows update earlier this month added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-assassins-creed-shadows-update-announced-adds-new-story-mission-and-fixes-a-deer-problem/1100-6531312/" data-ref-id="1100-6531312">new story pack</a>, with updates planned for later this year set to introduce new game plus, additional free story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h2>PATCH SIZES:</h2><ul><li>PS5: ~3.31 GB</li><li>XBS: ~19 GB</li><li>MAC: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~13 GB</li><li>Steam: ~4.3 GB</li></ul><h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h2>"Thrown to the Dogs" Quest Unlocked</h2><p>With this update, all players will receive access to the pre-order bonus quest, "Thrown to the Dogs". Help a loyal dog avenge his late master and unlock Tsuki-maru as a pet to place in your Hideout.</p><p>The quest is available in early game, once you have completed "From Spark to Flame". It can be found at the Tennoji Temple, outside of Osaka.</p><h2>SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS</h2><h2>Dead By Daylight Event</h2><p>We're excited to unveil our first special collaboration with this new Dead by Daylight event coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p><em>As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat...</em></p><p>This event comes with a new free quest that you can access from the Hideout upon unlocking Yasuke as a playable character. Once the event is completed, you will obtain a free trinket and banner.</p><p>You will also be able to further personalize your two characters with a Dead by Daylight-inspired pack in the store, featuring outfits, weapons, trinkets, and the chance to ride off into the shadows with none other than the loyal steed, Maurice.</p><h3>Balatro Trinket</h3><p>We are also adding a new trinket for Naoe, and an amulet for Yasuke called "Winning Hand" -- directly inspired by Balatro. These new items come with a legendary perk that gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders.</p><p>Now... you will need to work together to figure out how to get it!</p><h2>PARKOUR IMPROVEMENTS</h2><p>The team has prepared a bunch of improvements to enhance the parkour mechanics. We want to give a big thank you to all our dedicated parkour players for their ongoing feedback since launch.</p><p>Here are the main changes:</p><h3>New Vertical Jump</h3><p>We're adding a brand-new parkour interaction allowing both Naoe and Yasuke to jump and grab any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall-runs. To trigger it, simply press the jump button as you approach low overhangs, and your character will make the jump.</p><h3>Sprint Toggle Lock</h3><p>As long as the directional inputs are maintained, sprint no longer disengages when using Parkour Up or Parkour Down.</p><h2>Enhanced Back and Side Ejects</h2><p>We've also enhanced the distance and height of side &amp; back ejects, favoring foot landings over hand landings. This includes new animations for Naoe when performing height-gaining side ejects, extending her capacity to remain high-up during parkour.</p><h2>NEW PHOTO MODE FEATURES</h2><p>Photo Mode is receiving its biggest update for an Assassin's Creed game, with the addition of new features to better customize your shots and make the most out of capturing the beauty of Feudal Japan.</p><p>These include the following options:</p><ul><li>Change the time of day</li><li>Play around with numerous poses and facial expressions</li><li>Toggle headgear on/off</li><li>Play music while editing your shots</li><li>Sticker colorization</li><li>New customization frames</li><li>Save Custom Filters</li><li>Reset only one parameter</li><li>Tweak camera speed</li><li>Improved preview mode</li><li>Fullscreen (PC only)</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoy these new customization options!
