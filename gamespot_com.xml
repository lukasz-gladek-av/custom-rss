Here we guide you through unlocking the secret song for the Terminus map in BO6 Zombies.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock the Terminus Easter egg song</h2><p dir="ltr">In order to play the secret song for Terminus, you first need to <strong>find three hidden headphones</strong>. The headphones are blue and have fuzzy ears like the mode's Mr. Peeks bunny. These can be interacted with in any order and at any time during your match. Press Square (PlayStation) or X (Xbox) depending on your platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing this Easter egg will play the new Zombies song called "Can You Hear Me Come In," which is composed by Kevin Sherwood.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Mr. Peeks headphones</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390863-terminusfirstheadset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390863" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390863-terminusfirstheadset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390863"></a><figcaption>First set of headphones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390863-terminusfirstheadset.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first set of headphones you'll encounter is not too far from the map's starting point. Pass through the guard station, and then head out the back of the building, as if you're still following the map's objective markers and the purple arrows leading to power.</p><p dir="ltr">This will lead you down a set of stairs, and there will be a corner with some barrels and the glow of a lantern. The headphones are sitting on top of a large wooden spool here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390865-terminustunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390865" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390865-terminustunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390865"></a><figcaption>Headphones in the tunnels</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390865-terminustunnel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Head down into the mine tunnels, and you'll want to be at the end of the tunnels near the PhD Flopper perk machine. The headset is sitting on top of a blue barrel across from the perk machine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390866-terminusbiolaboffice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390866" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390866-terminusbiolaboffice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390866"></a><figcaption>Headphones in Bio Lab office</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390866-terminusbiolaboffice.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the third headset is inside the Bio Lab. This is the large area with the Pack-a-Punch machine. The headset is in the office on the upper floor of the lab. You'll find it on top of some white cabinets.</p><p dir="ltr">The song will play once you've interacted with all three. You can do these steps once per match to play the song.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-how-custom-loadouts-work-in-bo6-zombies/1100-6527402/">full guide on how loadouts work in Zombies</a>.

There are two maps to choose from, with Liberty Falls being a more casual map and Terminus being a larger and more hardcore Zombies experience. No matter which map you choose, you'll want to make sure you're well-equipped. Here we explain everything you need to know when building a custom loadout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How custom loadouts work in BO6 Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Custom Zombies loadouts return. Just like in Black Ops Cold War, you'll load into matches with a weapon and equipment of your choosing. However, the loadout customization is a bit different than recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll get one primary weapon slot. You can custom-build this gun with up to five attachments, assuming you have already leveled up the gun a bit and unlocked them.</p><p dir="ltr">Your loadout also comes with a dedicated melee slot. There are only two melee weapons in the game at launch. So, you can choose between a knife and a baseball bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can choose one piece of tactical equipment, lethal equipment, a Zombies field upgrade, and a pack of Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual guns you bring into the game won't be very powerful after the early rounds, and it costs a lot of points and salvage to level up that weapon's rarity and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-unlock-and-use-pack-a-punch-on-liberty-falls/1100-6527380/">Pack-a-Punch</a>. This is mostly a starter weapon, and thus the specific gun builds don't have to matter too much here.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be better off investing in Wall Buys with higher rarities, Mystery Box guns, or even Wonder Weapons like the Ray Gun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Augments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839"></a><figcaption>Zombies Augment Research</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Originally introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Augments are ways to make your field upgrades more powerful for your loadout, and they do the same for perks and ammo mods you purchase in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies matches get increasingly more difficult after round 25. The waves are more intense, and there are plenty of armored zombies that start to feel like bullet sponges. This is where Augments will become most beneficial. They'll give you added benefits such as extra health, increased movement speed, and immunity from fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll need to unlock Augments by completing Augment Research, which is a menu you won't have access to until you reach level 11. You'll want to <strong>make sure you start researching Augments as soon as you unlock the feature</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 108 total Augments in the game, with multiple major and minor Augments available for every perk, ammo mod, and field upgrade in the game. You can only research one Augment at a time, and unlocking them is painfully slow.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Stamin-Up perk is a good starting point</strong>, as most of the powerful Augments are locked until you've researched a set amount of Augments. This includes the helpful Juggernog Augments that require you to research eight Augments before unlocking access to this research. Juggernog Augment research will be something you'll want to prioritize once you've unlocked it.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list and in-depth breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-all-perks-ammo-mods-field-upgrades-plus-how-to-use-augments/2900-5875/#18">all the Augments in the game can be found here</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Field Upgrade recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840"></a><figcaption>All Zombies field upgrades</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, Black Ops 6 includes the following field upgrades:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aether Shroud: Phase into the Dark Aether, becoming hidden from enemy detection</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzied Guard: Repair armor and force all enemies in the area to target you. During this time, kills repair a portion of your armor</li><li dir="ltr">Healing Aura: Summons beams of energy down on yourself and allies to instantly revive and heal to full health</li><li dir="ltr">Energy Mine: Create a mine of pure energy that detonates in rapid succession, dealing lethal electric damage</li><li dir="ltr">Dark Flare: You generate a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage. The beam penetrates everything in its path</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few really solid options here, depending on your playstyle and if you're playing with friends. It's usually good to have a mix of field upgrades for a full team.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: A medic role is important, so you probably want to have at least one player with <strong>Healing Aura</strong>, and <strong>Frenzied Guard</strong> is for the teammate who likes to be aggro and pull all the zombies towards them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aether Shroud</strong> is also a good choice for team play or solo matches, as going invisible for a short time can let you escape a sticky situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Flare</strong> isn't the most team-friendly perk, but it is a lot of fun to use and deal out a ton of damage. <strong>Energy Mine</strong> is the least helpful and enjoyable option, so this is a bottom-tier pick that I wouldn't invest much in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gobblegum recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841"></a><figcaption>All Black Ops 6 Gobblegums</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums return in Zombies, and these are powerful but temporary effects you can use. These are extremely optional. Some players prefer not to even use Gobblegums or things like Augments to make the game feel like a more classic Zombies experience.</p><p dir="ltr">However, here are some tips for making the most of your Gobblegums. Your loadout lets you customize a pack of five gums of various rarities, and you can earn more unique gums just by playing and completing rounds. You'll see an in-game popup every time you earn a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd recommend grinding out some Zombies matches and saving up any powerful ones you earn for later matches, such as going for high-rounds or attempting an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">These will be gums such as:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic: Gives you all the perks on the map</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Up: Revives all downed teammates and lets them keep their perks</li><li dir="ltr">Wall Power: The next weapon you buy off the wall comes Pack-a-Punched</li><li dir="ltr">On The House: Spawns a random perk power-up that benefits you and your teammates</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, make sure to check out our Liberty Falls guides.

The Twitch campaign runs until November 13, with four items up for grabs, including a weapon blueprint. In order to get these drops, you will need to watch Twitch streams of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 where the creator has enabled drops.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Twitch Rewards</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713"></a><figcaption>It takes four hours to earn all four items from Twitch drops.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are four items up for grabs: the XMG Get Wiped blueprint, Never Broken calling card, Azurite Vision charm, and the Deflected emblem. Most of these rewards are purely cosmetic, although the XMG blueprint can be used in-game, letting you access attachments for the weapon before you might have unlocked them by leveling up. Each of these items has a specific hour count you need to hit.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Deflected emblem - 1 Hour</li><li dir="ltr">Never Broken calling card - 2 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">Azurite Vision - 3 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">XMG Get Wiped blueprint - 4 Hours</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check your progress by navigating to your profile icon on Twitch and going down in the drop menu to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drops and Rewards</a>, which is also where you can claim these items once you earn them. Before you can start earning these drops, you need to make sure your Twitch account and Activision account have been linked. If your account isn't connected, there is a connect option in the Drops and Rewards screen under the Black Ops 6 campaign, which will take you to the Activision website, where you can log in and connect the two accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have successfully connected your accounts, the connect link will no longer be on that page. From there, just head to the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> category on Twitch and look for the tag DropsEnabled to find a stream to watch. <strong>You will need to collect your rewards from the Drops and Rewards menu once you have met the time requirements.</strong></p><p>For more help with Black Ops 6, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/">Best Weapon Loadouts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-perks-and-wildcards/1100-6527396/">Best Perks</a> guides.</p>
