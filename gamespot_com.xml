                <p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit Publishing, a company that specializes in re-releasing mostly Japan-exclusive 8- and 16-bit games on modern consoles, was recently accused of using existing fan translations in their ports without credit. The company confirmed that the charges are indeed true, and that it plans to "offer a means of resolution" to the translators whose work went uncredited.</p><p dir="ltr">The four games in question are Shockman Zero, Assault Suits Valken, Gley Lancer, and Majyuo: King of Demons. These claims were first made by <a href="https://krokodyl.github.io/post/2025/02/retro-zero/" rel="nofollow ">translator Krokodyl</a> on their blog, who cited identical dialogue in several of the games, as well as custom fonts created by fan translators. The most damning piece of evidence is in Gley Lancer, where the fan translator MIJET added their own name to the Japanese version of the game's credits, which you can find in Retro-Bit's version, clearly indicating that someone else's work was used. As Krokodyl notes in the blog post, Retro-Bit stated in a public Q&amp;A that it did not "utilize any existing script or work" for these re-releases.</p><p dir="ltr">"After our discussion internally we as Retro-Bit concluded that the final work submitted contained, to a lesser or higher degree, uncredited work," Retro-Bit wrote in a statement to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/retro-bit-apologises-for-using-fan-translations-without-permission" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>. "...This was an irresponsible oversight on our end and we take full accountability for this outcome and not verifying the submitted translation. To amend this situation, we will set out to reach those whose work was not recognized to offer a means of resolution." </p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit further said that it has delayed future re-releases in order to further investigate the situation and make sure it doesn't recur.</p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit isn't the only retro-focused company to get in trouble in recent days. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/limited-run-blames-supplier-for-nes-carts-that-damaged-consoles/1100-6529581/">Limited Run Games apologized</a> for selling cartridges that could damage NES consoles due to a voltage mismatch.</p>

                <p>Wizards of the Coast has seemingly canceled its AAA game project at the Skeleton Key studio. Very little is known about the game, but it was mostly likely in the horror genre as the studio <a href="https://x.com/SkeletonKeyDev" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">describes itself</a> as creating "thought-provoking moments of suspense and horror guiding players to have fun and face their fears."</p><p>Skeleton Key's audio director said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gamesound_opentowork-activity-7299748721108340736-Z85S?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAQgvBIBcue4YPrQMQ6FKHefNWcYQOld0Wk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he was laid off due to the game's cancelation</a>. It's unclear how many other developers were impacted or if Skeleton Key will continue operations. GameSpot has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment.</p><p>In 2022, former BioWare veteran Christian Dailey <a href="https://company.wizards.com/en/news/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-new-studio-skeleton-key" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joined Skeleton Key</a> as its vice president and head of studio. He was best known for working on the Dragon Age franchise. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-key-bioware-leads-leave-the-studio/1100-6485118/" data-ref-id="1100-6485118">became executive producer</a> of Dragon Age: The Veilguard after Mark Darrah left BioWare in 2020, but then handed off the role to Gary McKay after leaving to join Skeleton Key.</p><p>In 2023, Dailey <a href="https://skeletonkeystudio.com/1-year-anniversary-blog" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a studio update</a> for Skeleton Key's one-year anniversary, but didn't reveal any other details about the game itself aside from saying that it was still being worked on and that a physical office space was being built in Austin, TX. Since then, the studio has been silent.</p><p>Wizards of the Coast has already canceled projects in the past. Back in 2023, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">company canceled at least five unannounced games</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Playground Games have announced that the new Fable game has been delayed to 2026. This update from the head of Xbox Games Studios, Craig Duncan, on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/xbox-game-studios-update-with-craig-duncan-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Xbox podcast</a>.</p><p>"We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025; we are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now," Duncan explained. "While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1009">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=1009" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Duncan went on to show some pre-alpha footage of Fable, which mostly consisted of combat. It looks like Fable will have a variety of different combat options, including wielding swords, hammers, and magic spells. There also seems to be seamless transition between cinematic cutscenes and combat. According to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-reportedly-has-witcher-like-combat/1100-6527863/" data-ref-id="1100-6527863">previous report</a>, Fable's combat will feel similar to that of The Witcher 3's. Duncan also said that he's played Fable's city elements, quests, and boss battles, noting that they all felt great.</p><p>As part of the video version of the podcast, some brief glimpses of Fable gameplay are shown. Those clips are compiled in the video below, showing off some of the various environments, horseback riding, combat, and more. This is all labeled as being pre-alpha footage, however.</p><p><span>Despite Fable being delayed to 2026, Xbox Games Studios has plenty of releases this year. </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/avowed-review/2300-6465692/" data-ref-id="2300-6465692">Avowed</a><span> just launched earlier this month, and </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ill-fight-through-the-motion-sickness-to-play-south-of-midnight-damn-it/1100-6529381/" data-ref-id="1100-6529381">South of Midnight</a><span> launches in April. </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a><span> will release in May. </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">The Outer Worlds 2</a><span> is expected to come this year, along with </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-gears-of-war-brings-back-the-developer-of-judgment/1100-6529045/" data-ref-id="1100-6529045">reportedly Gears of War: E-Day</a><span>.</span></p>
