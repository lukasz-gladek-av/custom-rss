                <p>The Sims is no stranger to collaborating with major fashion brands. Back in 2007, developer Maxis partnered up with H&amp;M to bring dozens of real-life clothing items to The Sims 2. In more recent years, both Primark and Moschino have made their way into the series with The Sims 4 Stuff Packs. Now, the American brand Coach is headed to the game in the series' most luxurious collab yet.</p><p>Starting on January 13, The Sims 4 players will gain access to The Coach Collection, a catalog of nine new items inspired by the "wearable staples" and "bold statement pieces" Coach is known for. The Create-A-Sim items coming include the company's Soho sneakers, a varsity jacket, and sleek skirt sets, while Build Mode will receive the heritage trunk and both Tabby and Brooklyn purses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180"></a><figcaption>A look at the upcoming Coach collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png"></figure><p>In addition to these items, The Coach Collection comes with a new family available to move in via The Sims Gallery: The Carriage House. The press release described the family as "three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama." The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the "In The Bag room," which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.</p><p>In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">values are unchanged</a>" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The team also reiterated that it is committed to creating "single-player life simulation experiences" while also teasing upcoming The Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile.</p>

This title may not have been built with multiplayer in mind, but at this year's <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> (AGDQ) charity livestream, players turned Super Mario 64 into a team sport as 70 different speedrunners joined forces for a single 70-star run through the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-VFPEh59k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-VFPEh59k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It was clear pretty early on that all of the speedrunners knew the tricks to getting Super Mario 64's stars in as little time as possible. Under their collective control, Mario pulled off some of the most athletic moves we've seen from Nintendo's iconic plumber. They even made some of the game's trickiest platforming moments seem easy.</p><p>In total, this speed run lasted just under two hours. There are 120 stars in the game, so it's possible to pull off an even larger Super Mario 64 relay at future AGDQ events. The current AGDQ event also had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youve-gotta-see-this-amazing-mario-kart-world-speedrun/1100-6537235/" data-ref-id="1100-6537235">a Mario Kart World speedrunner</a> complete the All ? Panels category in under 30 minutes.</p><p>During the last few years, Super Mario 64 players have pulled off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-speedrunner-collects-impossible-1-up-27-years-after-launch/1100-6512292/" data-ref-id="1100-6512292">an "impossible" 1-Up trick</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sealed-super-mario-64-door-finally-opened-nearly-30-years-later/1100-6523412/" data-ref-id="1100-6523412">opened an in-game door</a> that was sealed for decades.

                <p dir="ltr">The next game in The Sims franchise--codenamed Project Rene--has turned into a mobile-first experience that's all about social multiplayer. It is not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6510166/">The Sims 5</a>, and developer Maxis states this title can live in harmony with The Sims 4 and any future single-player installments in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis discussed the future of The Sims in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" rel="nofollow ">a blog post</a> celebrating the new year. Within this article, the companies noted that "Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together." In addition, the "mobile-first life-sim game" is about collaboration.</p><p dir="ltr">However, The Sims franchise won't forget about its roots. The blog post states: "At its core, The Sims was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn't going anywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">Originally announced in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-is-now-in-development-heres-a-first-look-at-its-build-mode/1100-6508378/">Project Rene was presumed to be The Sims 5</a>. But that changed in recent years, as EA and Maxis pointed out the in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wont-drop-sims-4-support-when-project-rene-comes-out/1100-6526534/">would complement The Sims 4</a> instead of replacing it. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">The Sims team declared their values wouldn't change</a>, in wake of fan concerns regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA's $55 billion deal</a> with the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund affecting the life-sim series.</p><p>Talk of Project Rene exploring multiplayer concepts emerged in 2023, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-multiplayer-could-be-inspired-by-animal-crossing-or-among-us/1100-6519254/">Animal Crossing and Among Us name-checked as possible inspirations</a>. Now, it's clear, Project Rene is going all in on social multiplayer. Outside of gaming, there is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-movie-from-margot-robbies-production-company-confirmed-will-include-freezer-bunnies/1100-6526524/">a Sims movie in the works</a>.</p>
