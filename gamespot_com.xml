                <p>Xbox Series X|S users had to wait an entire year for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong</a> to make the leap from PlayStation 5 and PC. Unfortunately, it went through some major compromises and a big visual downgrade according to a comparison by <a href="https://youtu.be/0-10490qd8s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-10490qd8s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-10490qd8s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Digital Foundry notes that the Xbox Series X port of Black Myth: Wukong can run at a higher resolution (1296p) than PS5 (1080p), which gives it a slight advantage in clarity and detail as well as its ability to deliver 60fps. However, that comes at the expense of the lumen lighting system in performance mode. The intriguing and visually arresting lighting of the PC and PS5 versions are noticeably missing on Xbox Series X. There are also more frequent drops and full-screen tearing on Xbox Series X.</p><p>Xbox Series S has even bigger struggles running Black Myth: Wukong, and can only do so with downgraded visuals and the absence of the lumen lighting system. It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> were behind the delay of the game's port, which publisher Game Science denied. The Game Science team has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing the game to the Xbox consoles was unexpectedly difficult</a>.</p><p>Last month, Game Science announced that Black Myth: Wukong will receive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-myth-game-zhong-kui-announced-with-teaser-trailer/1100-6534105/" data-ref-id="1100-6534105">a sequel called Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>. The development team added that the game is still very early in the process, but it has shared that players "won't be playing a monkey role this time." The studio is also "exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui."</p>
