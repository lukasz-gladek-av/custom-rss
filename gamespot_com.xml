                <p dir="ltr">The next major collaboration coming to Overwatch was teased last week, as Capcom's Street Fighter franchise will become the first-ever video game franchise to join Blizzard's hero shooter. Eight of Overwatch's heroes will be given the Street Fighter treatment, as they'll be able to dress up as eight of SF's world warriors, with some new themed emotes to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with Overwatch art director Dion Rogers and former character art director Arnold Tsang to talk about bringing Street Fighter to Overwatch, from the character-selection process to how Street Fighter inspired some of Overwatch's design choices from the very beginning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="11520" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497281"></a><figcaption>The eight Overwatch 2 X Street Fighter skins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497281-overwatchxstreetfighter6group.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Match made in heaven"</h2><p dir="ltr">From the beginning of discussionsâ€“"about a year ago," according to Rogers--the Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration has been what Tsang describes as "a match made in heaven." A big part of that, as Rogers describes, is Capcom's shared background in developing games.</p><p dir="ltr">"With some of our collaborations, there's a little bit more explaining to do," Rogers says. "Capcom though, they do this. They make games. They get it. If we come to them and say, 'Hey, there's some technical challenges with this, we're going to have to edit this look,' they understand. The back-and-forth between us and Capcom was really nice."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom also gave the Overwatch team "complete say" in which heroes would be included from the Overwatch side, as well as the Street Fighter characters they would be paired with. There was only one caveat: The Street Fighter characters had to come from the roster of the current game, Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr">"We had complete say on what that would look like," Rogers says. "Capcom gave some suggestions after reviewing things with us, but we have a ton of Street Fighter fans on the team, so the concept artists already had ideas. Ultimately, we had a conversation together that landed on which hero we choose as the right hero for a character."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Finding the right pair</h2><p dir="ltr">The team at Overwatch, with Capcom's input, eventually settled on eight Overwatch heroes and the Street Fighter characters they'd be portraying:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hanzo as Ryu</li><li dir="ltr">Sigma as M. Bison</li><li dir="ltr">Winston as Blanka</li><li dir="ltr">Cammy as Widowmaker</li><li dir="ltr">Soldier: 76 as Guile</li><li dir="ltr">Zenyatta as Dhalsim</li><li dir="ltr">Juno as Chun-Li</li><li dir="ltr">Kimiko as Juri</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Some of these decisions allowed the team to explore new facets of a hero; pairing Widowmaker with Cammy, a natural fit given their assassin or "femme fatale" background, also offered a unique opportunity to show Widowmaker with a more human-like skin color as opposed to her trademark purple.</p><p dir="ltr">Other groups presented unique challenges; making Sigma into M. Bison, for example, resulted in Sigma donning a cape, which is not usually part of his outfit. "It doesn't affect gameplay too much," Rogers said. "Usually the animations and the movement of the hero kind of dictate who they are, but Bison now becomes a unique skin for Sigma because of the cape; no other Sigma skin has that."</p><p dir="ltr">The best parts of designing the skins, however, were when the animators could inject parts of the Street Fighter character's background into unexpected places. Hanzo as Ryu might seem like it poses a challenge--Ryu is no archer, after all--but the team immediately paired the two as the design process was evolving.</p><p dir="ltr">"Everything else [with the pair] fits perfectly, but the fact that Hanzo's an archer? We thought, 'Well, everyone else has guns,'" Arnold Tsang said. "If Ryu was going to be in Overwatch, he'd probably pick up the bow in favor of something else."</p><p dir="ltr">The Hanzo pairing also let Tsang add that unexpected reference too--"In Street Fighter, Ryu has that white bag he usually travels with," Tsang explains. "If you look at the Hanzo skin, his quiver isn't actually a holder for the arrows. It looks more like that duffel bag, to mimic the traveling Ryu."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497280"></a><figcaption>Overwatch 2 X Street Fighter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4497280-overwatch-street-fighter.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Overwatch Fighter</h2><p dir="ltr">When asked if the team was surprised by how naturally the two properties fit together, Tsang says he knew immediately it would work, simply because Street Fighter is "in the DNA" of both Overwatch and his own artistic approach. "I learned how to draw by studying the Street Fighter and Capcom artists," Tsang explains.</p><p dir="ltr">He attributes this to why, from a visual perspective, the two sides meshed so well together. "I remember in the beginning, when we were making the game, we had our first few heroes, and one of the big decisions we made was we wanted heroes from different countries," Tsang says."That was hugely inspired by Street Fighter; I used to have a poster where I would see the different characters and the little flag beside their names. So, when we made Overwatch, I thought 'Let's bring some of that energy into the game and have all these characters from different countries, influenced by their culture.' Some of that DNA is there, in these heroes from all around the world coming together."</p><p dir="ltr">Now that Street Fighter is entering Overwatch, what if the roles were reversed and a hero for Overwatch joined the battle in Street Fighter? Tsang has a few ideas on who might best fit on the Street Fighter roster from the Overwatch squad.</p><p dir="ltr">"Genji and Doomfist are melee characters, so those are no-brainers," Tsang says. "A lot of the heroes have guns, so it's harder to imagine how they'd fit into a traditional fighting game, as it makes the martial arts aspect less creative. Hanzo has a bow, but he also has the sword; he could use that too." Eventually, Tsang settles on one of the first names he mentioned: Doomfist, who according to Tsang, was "designed to be a fighting game character, basically."</p><p dir="ltr">The Overwatch x Street Fighter collaboration begins May 20 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has rolled out a new Xbox update allows players to further customize the home screen, and the changes sound pretty nice. For now, the new features are available only to Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha users, before everyone else gets to try it later. You can <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for the free Xbox Insider program</a> to get early access to Xbox updates.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's received feedback from fans that they want the Home screen on Xbox to feel more personalized. Specifically, fans have asked for Microsoft to hide tiles they don't regularly use, and in general, make the Home screen feel "less crowded." This new update is an attempt to give fans some updates with those concerns in mind, Microsoft said.</p><p>"This update is part of our ongoing effort to make Home more personal, flexible, and responsive to your feedback," the company explained.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269" data-ratio="0.54969749351772" data-width="1157" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497269"></a><figcaption>You can now further customize the Xbox Home screen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4497269-screenshot2025-05-19at11.24.07am.png"></figure><p>So what's in the new update? To begin with, the Home screen now has three new settings, the first of which is "Hide System Apps." Whereas system apps would previously show up under "recently played games," this will no longer happen. The second new setting is "Pin Favorites to Home," and this allows users to pin up to three recently played games or apps to the recently played list. "These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles," Microsoft said.</p><p>The third is "Reduce Tile Count." This isn't available yet, but when it does arrive, users will be able to reduce the number of tiles that show up in the recently played games and apps list. "We're still refining this setting, and it will be coming soon," Microsoft said.</p><p>In other news, Microsoft just recently raised Xbox console prices, while the company will start <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">charging $80 for games later this year.</a> The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a> is coming June 8, with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> broadcast to follow immediately after.</p>

                <p>Summer is typically a great time to head outside, enjoy the warmer weather, and work on your tan, but if you're into video games, it's also a season of announcements. Similar to previous years, various developers and publishers are gearing up to reveal what they're working on, as they'll be taking to the internet for a series of livestreams. From indie games to upcoming AAA releases, the next couple of months are going to be a busy--but entertaining--time in the industry.</p><p>If you're looking to stay up to date on when these livestreams are being held, we'll be keeping track of everything and updating this post whenever a new livestream is announced. For now, there's a lot to look forward to already as Geoff Keighley's annual Summer Game Fest, the feel-good Wholesome Direct, and the Xbox Games Showcase are all confirmed for this year. A few other events are also coming even sooner--a clever move that will allow these respective initiatives more time to shine.</p><p>Here's a closer look at everything on the way.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#May_22">May 22</a><ul><li><a href="#Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</a></li><li><a href="#Six_One_Indie_Showcase">Six One Indie Showcase</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#May_29">May 29</a><ul><li><a href="#Indie_Quest">Indie Quest</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_6">June 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Access_Ability_Summer_Showcase">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#Summer_Game_Fest">Summer Game Fest</a></li><li><a href="#Day_of_the_Devs">Day of the Devs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_7">June 7</a><ul><li><a href="#Wholesome_Direct">Wholesome Direct</a></li><li><a href="#Future_Games_Show">Future Games Show</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#June_8">June 8</a><ul><li><a href="#Xbox_Games_Showcase">Xbox Games Showcase</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_Direct">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a></li><li><a href="#PC_Gaming_Show">PC Gaming Show</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="May_22">May 22</h2><h3 id="Warhammer_Skulls">Warhammer Skulls</h3><p><strong>Where to watch</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@officialwarhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li></ul><p><strong>When to watch</strong></p><ul><li><strong>PT: </strong>9 AM</li><li><strong>ET: </strong>12 PM</li><li><strong>BST: </strong>5 PM</li></ul><p>For all things grimdark in video games, the Warhammer Skulls livestream is the place to be.

The former Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios president recently opened up about plans for Soul Sacrifice 2 and Freedom Wars 2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-claims-2-fan-favourite-ps-vita-games-were-getting-sequels-before-the-transition-to-ps4/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> reports that Yoshida appeared on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-128985225?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> and discussed how sequels were in the works for both Vita exclusives at one point. "We were actually working on Soul Sacrifice 2 and Freedom Wars 2, but because of budget limitation we had to stop and move on to PS4," Yoshida said on the podcast.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED â€” Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soul-sacrifice-review/1900-6407884/">Soul Sacrifice</a> launched in 2013 for PS Vita and came from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keiji-inafunes-soul-sacrifice-headed-to-us/1100-6379783/">a concept created by former Mega Man designer Keiji Inafune</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-wars-review/1900-6415969/">Freedom Wars</a> arrived the following year in 2014 for the handheld. Both Vita exclusives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-sacrifice-monster-hunter-in-different-clothing/1100-6396876/">featured Monster Hunter-like similarities</a>, which is notable because Capcom's popular franchise skipped the Sony handheld after being a juggernaut on PlayStation Portable. Nintendo was able to secure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-headed-to-3ds-in-early-2015/1100-6417343/">Monster Hunter 4 as an exclusive for 3DS</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The online <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vita-exclusives-freedom-wars-soul-sacrifices-servers-shut-down-next-month/1100-6498377/">servers for Soul Sacrifice and Freedom Wars were shut down</a> in 2021. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-vita-exclusives-is-getting-remastered/1100-6526546/">Freedom Wars Remastered launched</a> earlier this year, providing a new way to play the game on PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>As for Yoshida, he's been showing up on other podcasts recently, too. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/">Yoshida stated that certain $80 games could be a steal</a> because of the hours of entertainment they provide.</p>

Siege X launches alongside a new season called Operation Daybreak. It redesigns the Defender Operator named Clash, who can now deploy her shield and activate its taser remotely. Operation Daybreak also brings other balancing updates to the game, such as electricity slowing Operators rather than damaging them now, reducing limb damage, and adjusting the abilities of Blackbeard, Jackal, JÃ¤ger, Thunderbird, and Sledge. The developers also plan to be more efficient in making anti-cheat updates throughout the season.</p><p>When Season 3 arrives several months from now, it will introduce a new Operator to the game, who is from Switzerland and wields a new weapon. It will also remaster the Nighthaven, Lair, and Consulate maps, feature the return of a Halloween event, and bring some changes to Dual Front to set up the new Operator. Then, Rainbow Six Siege will celebrate its 10th anniversary during Season 4, so Ubisoft will have a special in-game event for it. More Operator and map remasters, updates to training mode, and a new playlist called Testing Grounds will also arrive in Season 4.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X and Operation Daybreak will launch on June 10 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A test server for Siege X will run between May 20 and June 9.</p>
