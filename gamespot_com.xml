Those have been practically nonexistent since SteelSeries launched the Arctis GameBuds last October.

The GameBuds launched with a $160 MSRP, but recently, like some other tech brands, SteelSeries raised its prices amidst economic uncertainty. The GameBuds received the largest price increase, jumping from $160 to $200.

Inzone Buds offer markedly superior active noise cancellation and use the same audio drivers found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's flagship 1000XM5 earbuds</a>. That said, Inzone Buds aren't as versatile as GameBuds. You can use the included 2.4GHz USB-C dongle to connect wirelessly on PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, and mobile devices.</p><hr><p>But when it comes to Bluetooth, Sony went with Bluetooth Low Energy instead of the conventional Bluetooth 5 series (5.3 is common now). The problem with Bluetooth LE is that only a select number of Android phones support it. Apple doesn't use Bluetooth LE, and there aren't any major game consoles that support it either. As a result, Inzone Buds can't double as Bluetooth earbuds for general audio on your iPhone.</p><p>I personally still use Inzone Buds with my iPhone, but just know that you'll need to be cool with having a wireless receiver attached to your USB-C port. This also means you'll want a wireless charger since the receiver occupies your USB-C port. You can get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-Certified-MagSafe-Compatible/dp/B0DRCSZ618?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two-pack of Anker wireless chargers</a> for $28 (was $40) at Amazon. For a portable option, check out this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-10000mAh-Magnetic-Power-Black/dp/B0CH33F5P2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">popular 10,000mAh magnetic power bank</a> for $23 (was $35).</p><p>For a more budget-friendly pair of gaming earbuds, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRSCKG2D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Cetra Wireless Earbuds</a> are on sale for $70 (was $100). The ROG Cetra does not have ANC, but these stylish Bluetooth earbuds can sync with PS5, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. Asus also has a higher-end model called the Speednova that adds 2.4GHz audio as well as adaptive ANC. But even with a $50 discount, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXRS7BBN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ROG Cetra Speednova</a> costs more than the Inzone Buds and GameBuds, both of which we'd recommend over the $170 pair from Asus.</p><p>If you'd prefer a traditional over-ear gaming headset, Amazon has deals on a bunch of SteelSeries wireless headsets. Most notably, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X universal headset for $146 (was $200)</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/">Mecha Break</a> is an ambitious free-to-play anime mech shooter from Amazing Seasun Games. While Mecha Break's launch this week kicks off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mecha-break-season-0-rain-of-fire-challenges-and-rewards-detailed/1100-6532919/" data-ref-id="1100-6532919">a number of events and the game's first season</a>, it also adds a ton of new modes and features which were unavailable during its feature-limited open beta. The largest addition is a swath of multiplayer modes, ranging from co-op, PvP, and "extraction." A variety of new cosmetics and customization features are also newly available.</p><p>Here's how each of Mecha Break's new multiplayer modes work. In Operation VERGE, you'll battle in 6v6 matches. The first team to complete a map-specific objective--like capturing specific locations or escorting a vehicle--wins. Ace Arena is a 3v3 deathmatch mode, in which teams compete to be the first to kill eight opponents. In this mode, players can switch their mech mid-battle. Operation Storm is Mecha Break's extraction mode, taking place across a massive map called Mashmak. You'll combat both player- and computer-controlled enemies, stealing their loot, and attempting to make it back to a designated extraction point. You can enter Mashmak with a squad of teammates or all on your own. In co-op, you can explore restricted zones: locked areas where you have to fight a boss or complete objectives within a time limit.</p>

S.H.A.D.O.W. swiftly sent a squad to deactivate the Corite Extractors and avert disaster.</p><p>· Squads are tasked with dismantling as many Corite Extractors as possible within the area. These devices will activate automatically if not neutralized promptly. The first squad to meet the specified dismantling quota before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Palmbay Harbor</b></p><p>· The Corite Cascade Reactor at Palmbay Harbor, a vital power source for the port and nearby cities, requires a core replacement. S.H.A.D.O.W. has been tasked with escorting the new core. Meanwhile, Saint Enos has interfered, planning to infiltrate the Central Workshop and steal warship components by transporting and detonating a bomb disguised as a Cascade Engine, simulating an escort mission to sow chaos.</p><p>· Squads must escort the Transport Vehicle along a prescribed route to the Central Workshop. Activating three Signal Consoles en route will expedite the vehicle's progress. The first squad to arrive at the Central Workshop before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Eye of Misra</b></p><p>· Misra Matrix, in partnership with the Future Society, has positioned researchers in the long-dormant Corite mining site, Eye of Misra. As their research advanced, Windrose Logistics hired mercenaries to eliminate them. Upon receiving this intelligence, Misra Matrix deployed S.H.A.D.O.W. to secure the researchers' safe evacuation. As both S.H.A.D.O.W. and the mercenaries converge at Eye of Misra, a fierce battle ensues for control of the evacuation rocket's keys.</p><p>· Squads are tasked with retrieving launch keys from three data terminals and uploading them to the command module at the Central Launch Site. The first squad to successfully complete the upload or lead at the close of the operation will be declared the winner.</p><p>· Special Environment: Corite Pulse Storms</p><p><b>Gracelynn Skycity</b></p><p>· The Federation's intensive Corite excavation for Skycity construction incited conflicts with the Apostles, a faction revering Corite. In retaliation, the Apostles orchestrated an attack on Skycity. To mitigate this threat, S.H.A.D.O.W. confronted the Apostles directly within Skycity, resulting in a fierce firefight that halted an intercontinental cargo rocket launch.</p><p>· Your squad is assigned to neutralize enemy Strikers over three rounds in Skycity. Employ repair stations for support during engagements. The first squad to eliminate 8 enemy Strikers wins that round. Achieving victory in 2 of the 3 rounds before the operation ends secures overall victory.</p><p><b>Poseidon Armory</b></p><p>· The Poseidon Armory, an automated Striker factory engineered by Salem Electric Company, utilizes Isles-Vessel technology to navigate secretly in the deep ocean while producing giant Strikers for the Thalassic Federation. Upon discovering the unmanned facility, the Apostles planned to take control by hacking into its nodes to manufacture colossal Strikers for their forces. To counter this, S.H.A.D.O.W. dispatched a squad to safeguard the factory’s three control nodes and prevent the Apostles' scheme.</p><p>· Competing squads must capture and hold three Data Nodes to assume control of the armory. The squad that first completes data transmission or holds the lead when the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p>· Special Environment: Underwater</p><p><b>Stella Observatory Island</b></p><p>· This island, deserted during The Catastrophe due to volcanic activity and Corite contamination, is now targeted by Theia's Vanguard who aim to deploy Corite Extractors. These devices are intended to initiate Corite Pulse Storms, compelling S.H.A.D.O.W. to intervene. To counteract Theia's Vanguard, S.H.A.D.O.W. has dispatched a squad to disable the Corite Extractors.</p><p>· Squads are tasked with dismantling as many Corite Extractors as possible within the designated area. If not dismantled in time, the extractors will activate automatically. The first squad to achieve the dismantling target before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Longmen Launch Site</b></p><p>· The Vulturia Alliance has constructed a significant mass accelerator at this location, crucial for its space launch operations. Windrose seeks to exploit this by altering the mass accelerator's automatic launch program to covertly transport bombs, posing as a regular Alliance mission, and coordinating external attacks to destroy the accelerator track. In response, S.H.A.D.O.W. has dispatched a squad to intercept these plans and ensure the correct delivery of the Alliance's space payload.</p><p>· Squads must escort the Transport Vehicle along a designated path to the Launch Site. Capturing and activating three Signal Consoles en route will expedite the vehicle's progress. The first squad to successfully reach the Launch Site before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Vigil Imbrium</b></p><p>· Vigil Imbrium, an asteroid defense base operated by the Commonwealth of Lunar-mare, is equipped with missiles and artillery for destroying medium-sized asteroids. Theia's Vanguard detected weak defenses at the base and launched an assault to capture its main turret. In response, the under-resourced Mare-Imbrium Autonomous Region sought assistance from S.H.A.D.O.W. Recognizing a strategic opportunity, S.H.A.D.O.W. decided to neutralize the main turret to eliminate a potential threat to Earth-Moon relations. Their mission is to oust the invaders, secure the base, and decommission the main turret before it can be used.</p><p>· Squads must retrieve Digital Keys from three Data Terminals and upload them to the Main Turret for control. The first squad to successfully complete the upload or maintain the lead as the operation ends will be declared the winner.</p><p>· Special Environment: Lunar Surface, Solar Storms</p><p><b>Babylon Sky Fortress</b></p><p>· To safeguard the orbital elevator, the Thalassic Federation established Babylon Sky Fortress at its midsection, later fortified with airdrop weapons by Windrose under a security contract, escalating regional tensions. S.H.A.D.O.W. is tasked with disarming this threat by swiftly defeating the fortress's garrison forces at each level, neutralizing this heavily fortified position.</p><p>· Squads are required to focus on neutralizing enemy Strikers across 3 rounds. Repair stations are available during combat. The first squad to destroy 8 enemy Strikers secures victory in each round. Achieving two round victories before the operation concludes will result in overall victory.</p><h3><b>#Ace Arena#</b></h3><p><b>Gameplay Overview</b></p><p>· Combat initiates with each side deploying 3 Strikers. Victory is awarded to the first side to secure 8 kills or hold the lead when time expires. In the event of a tie at the end of regulation, the match proceeds to overtime, where the first team to achieve 2 kills wins.</p><p>· Within the Ace Arena, Pilots can strategically switch Strikers after being neutralized, allowing for precise adjustments and rapid counter-strategies in response to the opposing lineup.</p><p>· Designed to challenge Pilots' overall combat skills and adaptability, the maps in Ace Arena evolve as the fight progresses. Modular Weapons and Auxiliary Devices will randomly spawn during combat, enhancing tactical diversity.</p><p><b>Maps</b></p><p>Space Carrier: Trailblazer, Xiling Bunker City, Octantis Industrial Zone, Combat Matrix</p><p><b>Space Carrier: Trailblazer</b></p><p>· The Trailblazer, a vast passenger-cargo transport spacecraft, has been operational since the first Earth-Moon migration. Constructed by early Moon Pioneers using lunar resources, it showcases advanced autonomous construction and material printing technologies. The spacecraft has played a crucial role in transporting immigrants, supporting over a million residents on the Moon, and remains vital for importing essential carbon resources and other supplies.</p><p><b>Xiling Bunker City</b></p><p>· Post-Catastrophe, the Vulturia Alliance constructed the Xiling Bunker City near the ruins of Xiling City to shelter survivors and manage Corite contamination from the Wanshan Mountains. This elevating city can lower its core districts underground and seal itself from pulse storms, effectively shielding residents from their harmful effects.</p><p><b>Octantis Industrial Zone</b></p><p>· Situated on the outskirts of Hermes, a central bay port city on the Moon, the Octantis Industrial Zone was developed by NG Lunar Company. Initially a construction base for the lunar orbital elevator, it has evolved into a key logistics and storage hub for the cislunar route, now operating fully autonomously with no human intervention required.</p><p><b>Combat Matrix</b></p><p>· Originally a practice simulation for the early Ace Arena system, the Combat Matrix allowed users to customize terrain, room settings, and combat conditions. Despite its simplicity, it became popular for organizing training exercises and competitions. Scheduled for deletion, it was preserved due to its popularity among test users.</p><h3><b>#Operation STORM#</b></h3><p><b>Mashmak</b></p><p>· Mashmak is known as the world's largest and most perilous Marcens Zone, producing high-quality Corite with unique properties. This draws numerous factions to the restricted area, fostering a uniquely chaotic environment. After seizing control of Mashmak, Theia's Vanguard deployed Corite Extractors, triggering several massive Corite Pulse Storms that devastated the island strongholds of various factions. Recent intelligence indicates that Theia's Vanguard plans to leverage these storms to provoke a global crisis, coercing major Earth powers into capitulating to their demands. In response, multiple forces, including S.H.A.D.O.W., have deployed squads to counteract this threat. As a S.H.A.D.O.W. operative, remain vigilant of Corite pulse storms and hostile squads while neutralizing Theia's Vanguard and facilitating evacuations.</p><p><b>Gameplay Overview</b></p><p>· Engage and neutralize enemy forces in Mashmak, collect their dropped weapons and supplies, and secure extraction via the designated Extraction Point.</p><p>· Introducing the new combat mission mode in-game. S.H.A.D.O.W. evaluates your squad's performance, difficulty level, team capabilities, airdrop setup, and past missions to assign random combat tasks. Complete these missions to earn rewards such as Matrix Credit, Supply Crate · Scorching Fire, or activate an Extraction Point for evacuation.</p><p><b>Restricted Zones</b></p><p>Explore the new Restricted Zone feature in co-op mode. Squads must complete specific mission objectives or defeat area bosses within the given time frame. The difficulty of the Restricted Zone and target completion rates determine the variety of loot available.</p><p>To enter a Restricted Zone instance, squad members must airdrop a Locator Beacon (equipped with the corresponding Restricted Zone Key) to pinpoint the exact coordinates before heading to the instance entrance. Squads dropping Beacons of the same level may find themselves in the same Restricted Zone, where all competing squads have equal rights to claim loot from the supply crates available in the area.</p><p><b>Modes</b></p><p>· Free-For-All: Pilots face off individually. The Summoning Beacon enables reentry to the battlefield after a Striker is neutralized, with available uses depending on difficulty (3 in Normal, 2 in Hard, none in Extreme).</p><p>· Co-op Mode: Teams of three Pilots collaborate to overcome challenges. The Summoning Beacon allows for unlimited respawns of neutralized teammates. As the difficulty increases, the scale and number of accessible Restricted Zones also expand.</p><p><b>Difficulty Levels</b></p><p>· Normal: Requires Combat Readiness below 2,000. Enemies are easy and few, with 5 Extraction Points. Mercenary mod drop rate: 30%.</p><p>· Hard: Requires Combat Readiness below 6,000. Enemies are tougher and more frequent, with 3 Extraction Points. Mercenary mod drop rate: 60%.</p><p>· Extreme: No Combat Readiness cap. Enemies are highly challenging and numerous, with 2 Extraction Points available. Includes extra Extraction Beacons and Supply Crates. Mercenary mod drop rate: 100%.</p><p>· Combat Readiness depends on the Pilot's Airdrop setup and the mods on their Striker.</p><p>· In all modes and difficulty levels, eliminating a mercenary halts their mission in Mashmak, blocking their respawn via the Summoning Beacon.</p><p><b>Airdrop Settings</b></p><p>· Pilots have access to 7 customizable airdrop slots. Apart from the standard Summoning Beacon, all deployed Beacons and Auxiliary Devices are single-use and cannot be reused.</p><p>· Weapon Airdrop Beacon, Ammo Airdrop Beacon, and Locator Beacon become available for airdrop configurations only when Pilots equip the corresponding Modular Weapons, ammunition, and Restricted Zone Keys.</p><p>· If a teammate picks up and successfully exits with a Glider from your airdrop, it is automatically returned to you via mail.</p><p>· You can customize your Modular Weapons, Gliders, and various Beacons with paints and Insignias.</p><p><b>Supplies</b></p><p>· During exploration, Pilots can determine the value of weapons, supplies, and materials by checking either the sellable price in Matrix Credit or Corite.</p><p>· Collecting different quality materials for Gliders and Auxiliary Devices allows you to research and assemble these items for future airdrop configurations upon successful evacuation.</p><p>· Weapons and Gliders acquired or carried during exploration can be kept for future use if successfully evacuated.</p><p>· If a Pilot's Striker is neutralized, all equipped Modular Weapons and ammo are destroyed, but supplies in the Cargo Space may be retrieved by other Strikers.</p><p>· Materials, Gliders, Auxiliary Devices of Superb quality and above, and Modular Weapons of Rare quality and above can be sold or auctioned in the Matrix Marketplace.</p><p><b>Mods</b></p><p>· During Operation STORM, you can collect Mod Boxes of varying qualities. Successfully evacuating with these allows you to open them for random mods of the corresponding quality.</p><p>· Mods possess both beneficial and detrimental effects, applicable only in Operation STORM. Pilots should equip mods based on their specific needs and Striker configurations.</p><p>· Mod Boxes and mods of Rare quality or above can be sold or auctioned in the Matrix Marketplace.</p><p><b>Matrix Supplies</b></p><p>· Weapon Airdrop Beacons, Ammo Airdrop Beacons, Locator Beacons, and all types of ammunition for Modular Weapons can be purchased using Matrix Credits at Matrix Supplies.</p><p>· Matrix Supplies also automatically updates its inventory every 2 hours with 2 random Auxiliary Devices of Fine quality or below and 6 random Modular Weapons of Rare quality or below. Pilots may use Matrix Credit to refresh the inventory as needed.</p>

Microsoft made significant job cuts across the board, including the cancelation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online team</a>. But Xbox boss Phil Spencer still has his job, and despite rumors to the contrary, he isn't retiring.</p><p>Xbox's head of communications Kari Perez told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that, "Phil is not retiring anytime soon." That was in response to <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a rumor spread by Call of Duty leaker GhostofHope</a> that claimed Spencer will step down from his role as Microsoft Gaming CEO after the next-generation Xbox console launch, which would pave the way for Xbox president Sarah Bond to succeed him. As that rumor gained traction, Microsoft communications chief <a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frank Shaw posted on X</a> that it was made up.</p><p>In response to the outcry over the layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Spencer claimed that the cuts were necessary</a> and touted the future of Microsoft's gaming division.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," said Spencer. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.

                <p dir="ltr">Warcraft Rumble is shifting into life-support mode following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which appears to be targeting about 4% of the company's workforce, or around 9000 employees.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215864/announcing-changes-to-warcraft-rumble-support" rel="nofollow ">post on Blizzard's blog</a>, the studio announced that the team behind Warcraft Rumble would "continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content. " An email sent to staff by Blizzard president Johanna Faires about the layoffs, which was received and reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" rel="nofollow ">Aftermath</a>, reads, "As part of these changes, we made the difficult decision to shift to a scaled down, live ops-only phase of development for Warcraft Rumble, similar to our current approach with games like StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm.”</p><p dir="ltr">Warcraft Rumble, a mobile tower defense game based on Blizzard's popular Warcraft series, was released back in 2023 after nine years in development.According to this latest announcement though, Rumble "struggled to find its footing," and despite feedback from the community and changes implemented by the team, the efforts weren't enough to set the game on "a path to sustainability."</p><p dir="ltr">As part of the cuts at Blizzard, Aftermath reports that the number of impacted employees could be "as high as 100." While many are being let go, others are being moved onto other projects at Blizzard, though some of these teams are also facing losses among the restructuring.</p><p dir="ltr">These changes to Warcraft Rumble are reflective of the ongoing layoffs at multiple Microsoft divisions, especially under Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">It has been reported that an MMO from Zenimax Online Studios, the developers behind Elder Scrolls Online, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">also been cancelled</a>. The Initiative, a studio founded by Xbox to lead development on a now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">shut down</a> and Everwild, an ambitious game from Sea of Thieves' developer Rare, has also been canceled amidst these cuts.</p><p dir="ltr">Both projects had lengthy and troubled developments, with Perfect Dark eventually being partially outsourced to Crystal Dynamics for support. News around Everwild, which was announced back in 2019, quickly went cold, and after years of silence around the project, reports of the game's development, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/">key studio departures</a>, came out suggesting the title was being rebooted before ultimately getting axed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full impact of these layoffs is still being gauged as news slowly trickles out from the affected teams under Xbox's banner.</p>

                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off the game's next-level visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. According the game's director, Aoba Miyazaki, one of the highlights of My Hero Academia: All's Justice is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A. From this roster, players will assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing them to chain together attacks and quirk abilities. A new Rising system will also players to "significantly boost" the power of their characters by unleashing "their full potential," though the studio did not specify exactly what that might entail.</p><p>However, Bandai Namco did confirm it will be sharing more about My Hero Academia: All's Justice in the near future. For the time being, players can wishlist the upcoming title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p><p>The announcement of My Hero Academia: All's Justice comes more than five years after the last My Hero Fighting Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">One's Justice 2</a>, was released back in March 2020. One's Justice 2 was considered a significant step up from its predecessor, One's Justice, but failed to garner the sort of praise reserved for Bandai Namco's Naruto fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm/" data-ref-id="5000-33192">Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>, or its Dragon Ball fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz/" data-ref-id="5000-465487">FighterZ</a>.</p>

The company still has 40+ projects that remain in the works, and it's now been reported that everything shown during the Xbox Games Showcase in June remains in development.</p><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">"everything"</a> in that showcase is "safe."

Separately, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that "every game" on display at the event in June is "continuing on."</p><p>In terms of games that are not going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild </a>and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">new Perfect Dark have been canceled</a>--neither appeared at the Showcase, fueling theories about what that could mean. Microsoft's Matt Booty said in a memo to staff that "several unannounced projects" have been canceled as well, and one of them could be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">reported MMO Blackbird from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>.</p><p>Booty said the game cancellations, layoffs, and closure of Perfect Dark studio The Initiative "reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>Going forward, Booty claimed Xbox's portfolio strategy is "unchanged," and that is to make great games filled with "new stories, worlds, and characters." He specified that Microsoft has 40+ games in "active development" and teased a "strong slate" for 2026 that will include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">new Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, the next Forza game, and a possible Halo release.</a></p><p>Microsoft's cuts to Xbox came as part of a wider cost-cutting program that saw the technology giant lay off about 4% of its global workforce, amounting to around 9,000 people.</p>
