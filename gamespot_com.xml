                <p>Squid Games is taking over Fortnite, as Epic Games has announced that new creator-made games are available now to play. Like its Netflix source material, these are inspired by childhood games, but they're given a deadly twist as failure can result in elimination--at least it's better than what happens to the poor souls who lose a game in the popular TV series.</p><p>As you'd expect, there are also a few Fortnite elements present here, and some of the games revolve around lethal sumo rings, a deadly trap-filled gauntlet, and a recreation of the iconic Red Light, Green Light game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Squid Game - Official Creator Games Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The first collaboration between Fortnite and Squid Games kicked off in June with themed skins in the item shop, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squid-game-is-taking-over-fortnite-reload-next-week-with-a-new-map/1100-6532589/">a new Squid Grounds island was added to Fortnite Reload</a>, and several other accessories were added to the Fortnite shop. This launched in time for the final season of Squid Games on Netflix, and was also accompanied by various Squid Game assets and tools for budding creators in the Fortnite Creative mode.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/latest-fortnite-twitch-drop-campaign-is-live-to-celebrate-the-start-of-the-shock-n-awesome-season/1100-6533798/">Shock N' Awesome season</a> has begun, and it picks up after a massive live-event in the game saw players take on a giant kaiju, weaking the beast just enough for Superman to finish the job. This new Fortnite season features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers and Halo Spartan skins</a>, as well as the new Springleg medallion item that allows for some cartoonish mobility in the battle royale.</p><p>As for what's next, there are rumors that Fortnite players could be in for a spooky season, as it's claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-be-getting-jason-voorhees-and-ghostface-for-halloween/1100-6533777/">Friday the 13's Jason Voorhees and Scream's Ghostface</a> could be joining the game via its Fortnitemares mode in October.</p>

                <p>The price of many products is increasing of late, due in part to tariffs and other economic conditions, and this has stretched to gaming as well. Against this backdrop, FuturLab has released a tongue-in-cheek trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2 that confirms the standalone sequel's price--$25 USD--which is the same as the first game.</p><p>"FuturLab acknowledges that in the current cost-of-living climate, players often have limited budgets for games and entertainment. For many, PowerWash Simulator is more than just a game, it's a wellbeing tool, a way to decompress and reclaim a moment of calm. The team is keen to keep that experience within reach," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A9wbwsmsA0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0A9wbwsmsA0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PowerWash Simulator 2 builds upon the foundation of the original game and adds more features like split-screen co-op, four-player online campaign support, better visuals, and perhaps most importantly, pettable cats.</p><p>"The choice to stick with the original price comes from a place of genuine appreciation. The team has been genuinely moved by the response to the original game and its DLC packs, and the hope is that continued support into the sequel will allow them to keep this accessible price point locked in at launch, with no plans to raise it," the studio said.</p><p>FuturLab added that it's able to keep the price the same due in part to the success of the first game. It was initially released in 2022 and became a big hit, as people embraced the satisfying zen nature of cleaning things off with a high-powered water hose.</p><p>FuturLab said that, as with the first game, it will steadily support PowerWash Simulator 2 with ongoing free updates after launch, including licensed content.</p><p>The game is in the works now for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but a release date hasn't been announced yet. The original game launched on Game Pass, but it's not confirmed if the sequel will. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist PowerWash Simulator 2 on Steam now.</a></p><p>On the subject of increased costs in gaming, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden recently told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that publishers should have raised prices gradually over the years to account for ballooning budgets. Nintendo's Mario Kart World was the first major $80 game when it launched earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">it was a huge success for Nintendo</a>, though many people no doubt got it for a perceived discount with the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included a copy of the game.</p><p>Microsoft was set to charge $80 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a> this October but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">changed plans and is keeping the price at $70</a>. Many are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">expecting GTA 6 to come in at a price above $70</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/">the price of that game remains to be confirmed.</a></p><p>Others are not following Nintendo's path with $80 games, at least not yet, and that's because "everyone's afraid," according to Layden.</p><p>"No one wants to be the first one to raise the price, because you're afraid to lose traffic. So what you do is you just end up eating into your operating income, your profit margin," he said.</p>
