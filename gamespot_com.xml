                <p dir="ltr">Today, NetherRealm Studios hosted the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xHLNtlfsw">Kombat Kast</a>--the semi-regular livestream highlighting new characters and features coming to Mortal Kombat 1 in the near future. Though Halloween was last month, the presentation kept the scares going with a full reveal of Ghostface from Scream, along with an interesting twist: The character is actually <em>three</em> Ghostfaces in one, and two of them are from the Mortal Kombat universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast started with the gameplay trailer for the new fighter, which showed off multiple moves and combos, a fourth-wall-breaking Fatality, and a tease at his Animality where he morphs into a buzzard. After the trailer, it was explained that the original Ghostface--the one transported to the Mortal Kombat timeline--is the main fighter, but he can call other Ghostfaces into battle for him.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Ghostface DLC Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Those other Ghostfaces--per NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback--are "not anonymous," but instead are known characters from the Mortal Kombat canon. The only clues given during the stream were that both were recruited from Kano's Black Dragon clan, and that the male Ghostface is called "Black Dragon Enforcer" and the female is "Black Dragon Assassin." Each of the Black Dragon Ghostfaces have "clues" and "Easter eggs" that present while they're on-screen, and it will be up to the players to figure out who is who.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast also revealed new features and adjustments to the roster, including new moves and abilities for Ashrah, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, among others. A replay takeover was also highlighted, where players can rewatch a recent online match and "take over" for a brief period of time, in order to analyze the situation and strategize for future matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ghostface will officially join the roster on November 26, while those with early access through the Premium or Kollector's Edition will be able to play as the Scream killer one week sooner on November 19.</p>

                <p>Last year, quality-assurance workers at Bethesda and ZeniMax studios formed ZeniMax Workers United, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">the largest certified video game union</a> in the United States. Now that union is putting its collective power to the test in a brief strike against Bethesda and ZeniMax's parent company, Microsoft.</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United has been attempting to negotiate a deal with Microsoft over remote-work requirements while also limiting the number of outsourced QA workers who can be brought in on Bethesda's projects. The union didn't say who Microsoft is outsourcing QA work to, but it accused the company of ignoring requests to negotiate.</p><p>"They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it's become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked," QA test lead Rhyanna Eichnersaid told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>.</p><p>This one-day strike was called in an attempt to make Microsoft more receptive to addressing the union's concerns.</p><p>"Striking isn't fun or ideal, but there's a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions," noted senior QA tester Juniper Dowell. "Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table."</p><p>According to Dowell, many of the QA testers were hired during the COVID pandemic when remote work was more prevalent. Microsoft's current requirements call for QA workers to be in the office two days a week, while the union is asking for a more flexible remote policy.</p><p>After the strike began, Microsoft issued a statement affirming the company's willingness to "listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quote from MS rep to me re: today's ZeniMax strike (over remote work, outsourcing): "We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today. We will continue to listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table.” <a href="https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2</a></p>  — Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>If the one-day strike fails to motivate Microsoft to make any concessions or changes, it could lead to a longer strike in the future.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's in-game store gets stocked with all manner of microtransactions tomorrow, November 14, to kick off the game's Season 1. And included among them is the BlackCell bundle, which features Goliath as its headlining hero. Goliath is one of the most unique Call of Duty operators to date.</p><p>Goliath has a "molten, crystalized skull" whose armor emits flames. As you can see in the trailer below, Goliath is a menacing force to be reckoned with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgDL9clbEdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AgDL9clbEdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>BlackCell bundles are Call of Duty's most expensive in-game offerings, coming in at around $30. For that price, purchasers get a new Operator, along with 20 Battle Pass tier skips, an allotment of 1,110 COD Points to spend on other stuff, and exclusive guns. For the Season 1 BlackCell DLC, this includes the "Boiling Point" assault rifle that is actually dripping with fire. It also comes with the "Who's Laughing Now" finishing move in which Goliath's hyena companion comes in and tears your enemy apart. The bundle also includes a special BlackCell clan tag to show off in lobbies and winner's cricles.</p><p>Beyond all of this, BlackCell owners get BlackCell-exclusive skins for Sev, Bayan, Bailey, Carver, Alvarez, and Stone, along with six BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints. People who buy the BlackCell DLC can also unlock any single page of the Battle Pass and bypass the normal requirements.

Blizzard confirmed during its recent Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct that the long-asked-for feature will be part of the MMORPG's future Midnight expansion, saving the biggest crowd-pleasing announcement of the livestream for last.</p><p dir="ltr">In a short teaser video, a Death Knight walks into a nondescript house. Inside, the walls are adorned with the head of the dragon Onyxia, various weapons and shields, a miniature Goblin shredder mech, and more. The weary adventurer puts down their sword, settles into a chair by the fire, and takes a sip from a mug adorned with the words "Home Sweet Home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's about all there is to go on, but GameSpot did get the chance to chat with WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas prior to the anniversary livestream about the big news. He confirmed the feature has been in the works for several years.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've definitely given some cagey and evasive answers about 'housing ever?' while knowing secretly it was going to come to pass," Hazzikostas said. "We've known we've wanted to do it for real for some time. I think figuring out the how and when and making sure we can deliver something that's going to meet our players' expectations and exceed them, that's all the tricky parts to it. What we're announcing this week is a teaser, a hint, the slimmest of previews, just letting people know, 'Hey, it's coming as part of Midnight.'"</p><p dir="ltr">He said much more information will come over the course of the next year, but that the team is excited to have it out in the open so they can start to hear what players want from digital housing in Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just excited to get that news out there and to begin a conversation so we can start hearing from players what they're hoping to see from a World of Warcraft housing system," Hazzikostas said. "Double-check it matches what we are currently cooking but also gives us some time to pivot and make sure we deliver what players are hoping for."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398397"></a><figcaption>More about Midnight will be revealed next summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4398397-worldofwarcraft%28modern%292025roadmap.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">next three WoW expansions all at once</a> and said it hoped to start delivering expansions at a faster pace than its normal two-year expansion cycle. According to Blizzard's newly revealed 2025 WoW content roadmap, Midnight is not coming next year, though more details about the expansion will be revealed next summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Hazzikostas noted that even though Midnight isn't coming next year and players will still be playing The War Within in 2025, the team is dedicated to keeping the game's update cadence going at a steady pace while still getting a full-fledged new expansion ready "in a timely manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Players housing in WoW was just one of many Warcraft-related announcements to come out of the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Stream.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within is going full Goblin mode for its next major update, taking players to the city of Undermine where they'll partner with the various Goblin trade cartels and even get their own, fully-customizable hot rod to tear up the city streets in.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes as part of Blizzard's Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, where the developer announced what's next for the MMORPG as it celebrates 20 years. Titled Undermined, the 11.1 update is slated to arrive early next year, and will introduce a new raid, dungeon, two new delves, and kick-off The War Within Season 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Vehicles in WoW aren't exactly new, but its never had something like this. The new D.R.I.V.E. system sounds close to how the game's skyriding (originally dragonriding) overhauled flying mounts, only this time it's a similar idea for cars, allowing players go full Mario Kart on their personal ride. Instead of just passively going from point A to B, as is usual for ground mounts, players will actually drive the car like they would in a racing game. That means not only customizing the look and appearance of their Goblin-created gas-guzzler but also its stats. Those who want to build for all-out speed can do so, while others may want to invest in better drift capabilities, improved acceleration, more grip, or a combination of all four. And yes, you can boost.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't think people will be prepared for the speed the ground mount [car] moves when they get into it," assistant lead quest designer Mark Kelada told GameSpot. "I think it moves three-to-five times faster than your regular ground mount by default, not counting when you boost, and I think boosting gets up to faster [speeds] than skyriding at normal [without car speed upgrades]. It flies, pun unintended, it flies across the zone. It is really, really fun to interface with a new landmass like Undermine with a car."</p><p dir="ltr">The city streets of Undermine are tailor-made to take advantage of the new feature. There will be timed races to participate in throughout the zone, though Kelada said those looking for PvP races will have to organize their own circuits. For now, the feature is relegated to the Undermine zone specifically and only works for the new vehicle introduced as part of the update. However, that was also initially the case with skyriding, something that is now usable with nearly every flying mount. With that in mind, it's hard not to see a future where the system gets adapted to other ground-based motor vehicle mounts that already exist in WoW's ever-growing mount catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">A big part of Undermine is the four Goblin trade cartels that have thrown the city into chaos, and players will get to pick a side. The Steamwheedle, Bilgewater, Blackwater, and Venture Company cartels will be available to team up with, with certain rewards and activities tied to each cartel, including car parts. Signing up with one cartel isn't an exclusive arrangement, and Blizzard said players will be able to work with each Goblin faction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399088-wowwarwithinunderminecar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399088" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399088-wowwarwithinunderminecar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399088"></a><figcaption>Players will be able to customize not only the look of their car, but also its stats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4399088-wowwarwithinunderminecar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kaleda said the cartels all play a role in the Undermine story campaign, as do some new characters introduced to show a new side of Goblin culture. The story is in some ways more personal, Kaleda said, and intended to help players understand more of how Goblins interact with the world and where they are coming from. But don't worry, there will still be plenty of wacky gadgets and explosions.</p><p dir="ltr">"I do want to say too though, we made sure we keep the levity of Goblins," Kelada said. "I think people connect to [how] they're just zany and creative."</p><p dir="ltr">Delves, the new form of endgame content built for solo or small group play introduced in The War Within, will continue to be a focus going into the Undermined update. Two new delves will be added, as will new variations for existing delves. There will also be a new delve pinnacle boss to take on, similar to Zekvir in Season 1. Brann Bronzebeard, the customizable AI companion that assists players while in delves, is getting some new changes, too. No longer just relegated to the damage or healer role, Brann will be able to tank in Season 2, giving players who main healer a more convenient way to engage with delves.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're really happy with how delves are playing out, and I think they are on their way to being that other pillar of endgame alongside raids, dungeons, and PvP that we always hoped they would be," game director Ion Hazzikostas said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Liberation of Undermine will be the game's next eight-boss raid, one that will take players through the streets of the city and into a vast complex that hides dark secrets. Those secrets are owned by infamous ex-Goblin faction leader, Gallywix, whom it looks like players may be taking on in some form in the raid. In addition, a new dungeon taking place in The Ringing Deeps, one of the expansion's launch zones, will task players with preventing a group of Goblins from destroying a dam. The dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, will immediately be available as part of the Season 2 Mythic dungeon pool alongside Battle for Azeroth's Goblin-themed dungeon, The Motherlode.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard had plenty of other announcements during its Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-is-finally-getting-fresh-servers-as-cata-players-move-on-to-pandaria/1100-6527720/" data-ref-id="1100-6527720">what's next for WoW Classic</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remastered-make-up-a-new-warcraft-battle-chest-available-today/1100-6527719/" data-ref-id="1100-6527719">remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2</a> that are available today.</p>
