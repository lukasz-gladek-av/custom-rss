The game has a distinctly French vibe to it--thanks to it being visually influenced by France's Belle √âpoque art movement--but early in its development, Expedition 33 was originally set in a steampunk world that was populated with supernatural enemies.</p><p>"This game was very different. The gameplay would have been similar, but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things," narrative lead Jennifer Svedberg-Yen explained to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-narrative-lead-jennifer-svedberg-yen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Becoming A Parry Master In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 In 13 Minutes</p>
      </div>
<p>After Expedition 33's investors encouraged developer Sandfall Interactive to think bigger, this led to the game being rebooted entirely. The studio had been working on Expedition 33 for six months at this point, and the new direction was inspired by a painting that game director Guillaume Broche liked and a short story with artistic themes that Svedberg-Yen had written.</p><p>The final spark for Expedition 33's new direction was Guillaume's mother, who helped provide the "catalyst" for the story. From there, all the pieces fell into place as Expedition 33's crew polished the story and recruited an all-star cast of actors to voice the game's characters. While the game does leave some room open for a potential sequel, Svedberg-Yen added that Sandfall Interactive is now focused on fine-tuning Expedition 33 and addressing any bugs. That doesn't mean that the studio isn't thinking about producing new content, but "it's probably not going to be for a while" Svedberg-Yen said.</p><p>Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-new-patch-nerfs-the-strongest-party-member/1100-6531420/">recently dropped a patch that addresses several issues in the game</a>. The patch has also drastically reduced the power of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">popular Stendhal build</a>, but savvy players can still use it to inflict absurd amounts of damage on tough enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">Expedition 33 has so far sold over 2 million copies since launch</a>, and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">official soundtrack is also doing quite well</a> on the streaming charts.</p>

                <p>As one of the developers who worked on the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> back in the early 2000s, Chance Glasco wonders if the behemoth FPS franchise has run out of ideas. A series veteran and one of the original members of Infinity Ward, Glasco says he doesn't play much CoD anymore--though he does enjoy a bit of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p>In an interview with Tulsa, Oklahoma's <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/6821e0dcae532fd615116ad5/call-of-duty-creator-chance-glasco-tulsa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">News 9</a>, Glasco shares his experience as one of the 23 employees who left Medal of Honor developer 2015, Inc. for newly established Infinity Ward to work on Call of Duty. "We knew we could make a really good game," Glasco said. "Activision gave us the freedom to do things we couldn‚Äôt on Medal of Honor, but it was still a new franchise."</p><p>Call of Duty wasn't an instant hit when it released in 2003. Instead, it took time for word to spread. "It didn't have a big spike in sales right away," Glasco recalls. "It just climbed gradually as word got out. Multiplayer really hooked people, and over time, it became huge."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="810796308" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"It's almost like The Simpsons--it's been around so long that it feels like they've run out of ideas at times. It kind of wandered into left field, but I still enjoy playing Warzone."</p><p>"I spent more time making WWII games than America was actually in WWII, so moving to modern settings felt refreshing," Glasco added, referring to the shift in setting that started with Modern Warfare in 2007. "I wouldn‚Äôt say [Call of Duty] peaked at Modern Warfare 2, but that was probably the best game we made."</p><p>Call of Duty gets a new main-title release every year, and has followed that release pattern since 2005. The series now also has multiple ongoing live-service games including free-to-play battle royale title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-572199">Warzone's mobile port</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call Of Duty: Mobile</a>. The most recent major CoD release was Black Ops 6, in October last year.</p>

                <p>The next WoW Remix event is coming, and this time it's fan-favorite expansion Legion in the spotlight. The upcoming Legion Remix event had already been teased by Blizzard, but it was officially announced at the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2454299911?t=7h16m54s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolving Azeroth panel</a> at PAX East over the weekend.</p><p>World of Warcraft associate game director Jeremy Feasel officially announced the new Remix event, as picked up by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/legion-remix-officially-announced-at-pax-east-mythic-and-shattered-timeline-376808?utm_source=discord-webhook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, and shared some insight into the ongoing process of remixing Legion.</p><p>"Legion has a lot of content--way more content than Mists of Pandaria--and it has a huge amount of different systems," he reminded fans. "The team is currently hard at work delving deep into 'how we are going to integrate all these systems in a remixed way. Which systems are we gonna remix? Which systems are we gonna remix and add new things to?'"</p><p>The extra complexity in Legion means we don't have many details or even a release date for Legion Remix yet, but Feasel did share a few tidbits on what fans can expect. First in line to get the Remix treatment are Mythic Keystones, which were first introduced to WoW in the Legion expansion.</p><p>"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could do Mythic Keystones with the wild item scaling of Remix, and see how high you can go? We think that would be cool. We're really excited about folks getting a chance to do that and just figuring out how to completely break that game," Feasel said, adding that he fully expects players to break the game with the remixed Mythics--and have a lot of fun doing it.</p><p>The second feature of Legion Remix that Feasel announced on the panel was the addition of a new increased-difficulty world tier called the Shattered Timeline. "It's a timeline where everything went worse, and everybody is significantly more difficult," Feasel explained, adding that the addition of world tiers was heavily inspired by the Diablo team.</p><p>WoW's first Remix event was Mists of Pandaria, which dropped around this time last year. The event, which saw players power-levelling through Pandaria and picking up powerful new gear and items, was a hit with fans, leaving players speculating what other expansions would be up for the Remix treatment next.</p>
