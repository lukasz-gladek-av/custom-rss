                <p>Hytale is finally out now, after 10 years of development. If you're looking for the game on Steam, you won't find it there because developer Hypixel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/" data-ref-id="1100-6537319">launched the game exclusively through its own app</a>. But why is Hytale not on Steam, and could it ever be released there? Here's what we know.</p><h2><strong>Why not Steam?</strong></h2><p>Executive producer Patrick Derbic said in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that Hypixel opted to release Hytale through its own launcher at first to allow the team to communicate more closely with its own fans and community. Derbic said bringing the game to Steam at launch might have brought a "flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction."</p><p>This isn't to say that Hypixel wants to bury its head in the sand and avoid criticism, however. The studio said it does not shy away from "honest, negative criticism," going on to say the developer itself has been "very critical" of the game it's making. Releasing on Hytale's own dedicated launcher was a purposeful decision the studio made to help ensure "the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background."</p><h2><strong>Hytale could come to Steam later</strong></h2><p>Derbic went on to say that Steam is a "great platform and marketing tool," but Hypixel "might never need" to put Hytale on it. Or it might. The decision hasn't been made yet.</p><p>"This doesn't mean Hytale will never be on Steam; right now, we don't see the need for it, as we want to keep our launch closer to our community," Derbic explained.</p><p>The developer added that Steam does not currently support all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-hytale-mods/2900-7397/" data-ref-id="2900-7397">Hytale's modding features</a>, adding that the developer aims to discuss this with Valve "to see what's possible."</p><p>Hytale is also not available on console, but in that case, Hypixel confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/" data-ref-id="1100-6537393">will bring the game to console at some point in the future.</a></p><h2><strong>Steam is powerful</strong></h2><p>Steam is among the largest, most dominant, and ubiquitous online stores for digital PC games in the world, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-already-set-a-new-concurrent-player-record-clearing-42-million/1100-6537339/" data-ref-id="1100-6537339">millions upon millions of users logging in every day.</a> It's a powerful storefront for games big and small. Valve, which owns and operates Steam, takes a cut of game sales, and in bypassing Steam, Hypixel won't have to pay those fees (though it may have other platform fees and costs to pay).</p><p>Steam has so many catalog games and new releases that discoverability has been cited as an issue for some, but it's also a platform where smaller games can break through and find a massive audience.</p><p>Minecraft, the game that inspired Hytale, is also not available on Steam, while Riot's League of Legends has its own dedicated launcher as well. Companies like EA and Ubisoft pulled games from Steam, citing business reasons, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-more-ea-games-coming-t/1100-6470951/" data-ref-id="1100-6470951">relenting</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711"> returning.</a></p><p>Rivals to Steam like the DRM-free GOG and Fortnite developer Epic's Epic Game Store have emerged, but none have come close to matching the size, scale, and importance of Steam.</p>

According to the leaks, Forza Horizon 6 will reportedly launch on May 19, while the Premium Edition of the game will allow buyers to start playing four days early on May 15.</p><p>Xbox Infinite--an Xbox news site based in Saudi Arabia--posted an image of what it claims is an in-game announcement from Forza Horizon 5, detailing the Forza Horizon 6 release date and DLC that will be available in the Premium Edition. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC corroborated the claims</a>, saying that its sources had confirmed that this is the correct release date for the game. According to the image, the Premium Edition will offer early access, VIP membership, car packs, an exclusive Ferrari, and post-launch car pack DLC.</p><p>Forza Horizon 6 was officially revealed ahead of the Xbox showcase at Tokyo Game Show last year, and the next chapter in the racing series will see the Horizon Festival <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-forza-horizon-6-aims-to-get-its-japanese-details-right/1100-6535031/">move to Japan</a>. It'll launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S first, with a PS5 release date to follow. Forza Horizon 5 launched on PS5 last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/">and the game proved </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/">a huge success on the Sony platform,</a> selling over 5.1 million units.</p><p>At the same time, things aren't looking too good for Forza Motorsport, as developer Turn 10 Studios announced late last year that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-motorsport-content-updates-are-coming-to-an-end/1100-6537039/">ending development of new content</a> for the game. While the servers will be kept online for the foreseeable future, there will be no "new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes" for the game, the studio said.</p>

According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, the unannounced title is codenamed P11 and features intriguing likenesses to the canned Ubisoft game.</p><p dir="ltr">The report also states that P11 has been in development since 2019, with Unreal Engine 5 powering the project. However, Insider Gaming adds there have been "significant setbacks" for the game. In 2024, Embracer Group <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deus-ex-game-canceled-amid-embracers-ongoing-cost-cutting-report-says/1100-6520668/">canned a Deus Ex game in development and cut 97 people from Eidos Montreal</a>.

Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/">another 75 employees lost their jobs</a> at the studio.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for P11, <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" rel="nofollow ">an X user named Timur222</a> found that an Eidos Montreal employee on LinkedIn refers to the project as a "AAAA" game. Insider Gaming initially thought that Embracer may have somehow acquired the Wild rights from Ubisoft because this project looks so similar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/">Wild was revealed in 2014</a>, showing players riding a bear and even assuming the control of an eagle and rabbit. The PlayStation exclusive was reportedly canceled in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The codename probably just refers to the project being the 11th game for Eidos Montreal. The studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/">currently co-developing Fable</a> with Playground Games and also assisted on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grounded-2-review-little-big-planet/1900-6418390/">Grounded 2</a>. The last game that Eidos Montreal headed development on was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-shot-through-the-heart/1900-6417764/">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> in 2021.</p>

                <p>Hytale is finally out now in early access following 10 years of development and a cancellation. Like other early-access games, Hytale isn't finished and may contain bugs and other oddities as developer Hypixel updates and improves the game over time. The studio has now <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> what's to come in the immediate future, and more of what's on tap on a longer-term horizon.</p><p>For the "first few months," Hypixel will release updates "quickly and frequently" to address the "backlog of obvious construction sites" that the team wants to address. For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-riot-canceled-hytale-and-how-it-came-back-to-life/1100-6537388/" data-ref-id="1100-6537388">Hypixel purchased Hytale from Riot in November 2025</a>, and in the eight weeks since, the team did what it could to get Hytale out, but this also means the team didn't get to every item it wanted to fix or address.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NNh6Dz7YpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NNh6Dz7YpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Looking further out, Hypixel said it plans to release "larger, more bespoke updates" and new features for Hytale. This will include official minigames, with development set to begin on these "in the coming months." These minigames will add "systems and features that expand gameplay," Hypixel said.</p><p>Additionally, Hypixel said it's also prototyped social features for Hytale, including proximity voice chat and friends lists.</p><p>Another future update for Hytale will add an Adventure Mode, which will have "rich story and narrative elements, deeper progression systems, dungeons with boss fights, and more." </p><p>"Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time," Hypixel said.</p><p>Hytale is available now through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/" data-ref-id="1100-6537319">Hytale Launcher</a>. The game appears to be off to a good start, boasting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-off-to-quite-the-strong-start-with-impressive-twitch-viewership-numbers/1100-6537390/" data-ref-id="1100-6537390">impressive viewership numbers on Twitch.</a></p>
