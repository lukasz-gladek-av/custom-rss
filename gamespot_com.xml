                <p>Fortnite's roster of streamers who have skins in the item shop just got a little bigger with <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/not-clixbait-clix-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the addition of Cody "Clix" Conrod</a>, who, at 19 years old, will be one of the youngest people ever to have a Fortnite skin based on them. Along with the new Clix skin, there will be a full slate of Clix-related cosmetics and, in a first for this sort of thing, a Clix-themed remix of an existing skin.</p><p>Clix, for those who aren't familiar, made a name for himself by earning a spot in the Fortnite World Cup in 2019 when he was just 14 years old. And while he continues to compete at the highest levels, he's also become a popular streamer and personality, which is how he's landed his very own Fortnite skin.</p><p>Clix's slate of cosmetics will include a single skin that comes with two distinctive styles based on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1977965-fernanfloo-dresses-up-my-wifes-funeral" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a meme you probably know</a> even if he's new to you--one in which he's sporting a t-shirt and pajama pants, and another in which he's wearing a suit and tie. In addition to the skin, Clix's set includes two back blings, two emotes, a wrap, and a pickaxe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460449" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460449"></a><figcaption>Me at my aunt's wedding vs. me when the Fortnite item shop resets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4460449-clixiconseries-clixmeme.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4460443,1300-4460442,1300-4460441,1300-4460440,1300-4460439" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460443-clixfortniteskin.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460442-clixiconseries-clixykeyesbackbling.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460441-clixiconseries-sparxoutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460440-clixiconseries-clixcosmetics.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4460439-clixiconseries-dr3aminspray.jpg"></figure><p>There's also a new Clix-themed version of the Sparkplug skin called Sparx. Everything listed here will be sold in the item shop starting March 22, both individually (including the back blings) and as part of one large bundle that includes all of it.</p><p>As is customary for this sort of thing, Fortnite will offer players the chance to unlock the whole set of cosmetics for free by participating in the Clix Icon Cup, a battle royale trios (builds only) tournament taking place on March 21--those in the top tier of performers for each region will earn the full bundle. But in an unusual move, there's also a consolation prize for those who just miss out: the next-best tier of performers will get the Sparx outflit. Anyone who earns at least 8 points in the tournament will get a spray.</p><p>Clix will become the person born most recently to have a Fortnite skin, dethroning The Kid Laroi, who was also 19 when he got a skin in 2023. But here's a fun fact: Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf got his Fortnite skin when he was 18, making him the youngest to ever earn that honor.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As a special 24-hour promotion, developer Lucid 11 is offering Party Club for free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2796010/Party_Club/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, with the price rising to $16 afterward. There is also a special in-game outfit that players can unlock by checking out the co-op game on today's release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2796010/Party_Club/" rel="nofollow ">Party Club</a> seems similar to the popular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overcooked-review/1900-6416577/">Overcooked</a> series, as people work together to serve customers. In this game, however, the consumers are furry creatures and seating considerations must be addressed. For example, Lucid 11 states that putting a panda bear at the same table as a tiger could create serious issues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTL87GkOvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RRTL87GkOvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's not all, either. Party Club stands out in a couple of ways from other meal-preparing experiences. The online co-op title (for up to four people) lets players set up their location before hitting a gong to open up shop to animal customers. Also, hilariously, if you're tired of working on mixology, Party Club allows for fighting clientele and removing them from the premises.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a ton of competition on Valve's storefront, even when there's no cost barrier. GameSpot recently rounded up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/#1">the 28 best free Steam games</a>, including Counter-Strike 2, Marvel Rivals, and Apex Legends.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam games can also seemingly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/repo-has-come-out-of-nowhere-on-steam-topping-145000-concurrent-players/1100-6530038/">come out of nowhere to set impressive concurrent-player counts, such as REPO</a> recently. Meanwhile, the free offer for Party Club will end at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET tomorrow, March 18.</p>

                <p>Despite being more than 20 years old, the GameCube controller remains stubbornly popular with Nintendo fans, especially when it comes to certain games. A new FCC filing by Nintendo has some fans speculating that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> might receive some kind of GameCube controller support, but it's unclear if the connection is valid or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Over at <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/new-fcc-filing-discovered-that-looks-a-lot-like-a-gamecube-nso-controller.12879/#post-1660543" rel="nofollow ">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/switch-2-gamecube-controller-rumours-resurface-following-new-nintendo-filing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>), fans reacted to a FCC filing from Nintendo that tackled game controllers. Fans noticed that the model number prefix attached is BEE, which corresponds to the Switch 2. A mockup of a "wireless Bluetooth controller" led one fan to overlay the GameCube controller over it, concluding that the controller may be some kind of wireless GameCube controller for the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Some other fans argued that the mockup could be for the Switch 2 Pro Controller, but the original poster argued that this controller lacks NFC functionality, which a hypothetical Pro Controller would almost certainly have.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Nintendo has already released wireless versions of classic video game controllers for its retro-focused Switch Online subscription service, including the NES, SNES, N64, and Genesis controllers. However, we don't have GameCube games on Switch Online as of yet, making them a possible addition.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear if we'll get any answers to this question at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a> at the beginning of April, but we'll keep you posted with any updates we get.</p>
