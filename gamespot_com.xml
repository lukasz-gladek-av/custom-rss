                <p>From Software is not currently considering Elden Ring 2, according to studio boss Hidetaka Miyazaki. He confirmed this during a speech following a recent awards ceremony where the game's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion took home an award.</p><p>Asked about the expansion of the Elden Ring franchise, Miyazaki said, as reported by <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring/77553/news/elden-ring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN Japan</a> and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftware-has-no-plans-for-elden-ring-2-but-they-have-several-new-titles-in-the-works-according-to-miyazaki/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, "We're not really considering developments such as an Elden Ring 2."</p><p>While there may be no sequel plans currently, Miyazaki said the Elden Ring franchise could return "in some form in the future." Miyazaki previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">people have expressed interest in making an Elden Ring movie</a>, but no such project has been officially announced.</p><p>Miyazaki also confirmed that From Software has multiple games currently in the works; he's working on some directly, while others are being managed by different developers at the studio.</p><p>Elden Ring, which was released in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-passes-25-million-players-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-launch/1100-6524201/" data-ref-id="1100-6524201">reached 25 million players in June</a>, and that was before Shadow of the Erdtree's release. Years after launch, the game continues to sell, and is actually the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 8 best-selling game of 2024 so far in the US.</a></p><p>The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5956">nominated for overall Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>, and that's because DLC and expansions are eligible for Game of the Year this year. The awards ceremony takes place on Thursday, December 12.</p>
