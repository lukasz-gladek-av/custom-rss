                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> is one of this year's biggest surprise hits among the indie crowd, especially since it's a life-sim game about building up your own drug empire. But if the game's subject matter kept it from being sold on Steam, Schedule 1 creator Tyler was going to pivot and make into a farming sim.</p><p>"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game," Tyler told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/creator-of-drug-lord-hit-schedule-1-had-a-backup-plan-so-that-if-steam-wouldnt-take-it-for-whatever-reason-i-could-just-pivot-it-to-be-a-farming-game-and-strip-all-the-drug-stuff-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game--but thankfully, it was all right."</p><p>Tyler went on to note that a few other countries "don't love it," including his native Australia.</p><p>"We were effectively banned in Australia, which kind of sucked, but we got it there in the end," recalled Tyler.</p><p>Schedule 1 may remind some players of Breaking Bad, as the main character moves into a new city and slowly begins to expand their drug dealing operations. Players can grow cannabis in the game, but only in support of selling and distributing it. It's also possible to cook meth while avoiding unwanted attention from the police and rival dealers.</p><p>Although the game is still in early access, Schedule 1 recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-update-adds-rival-cartel-wars/1100-6534328/" data-ref-id="1100-6534328">cartel wars</a> to its features. TVGS has also invited players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vote-now-to-choose-schedule-1s-next-big-feature/1100-6534499/" data-ref-id="1100-6534499">vote about which feature</a> will be added to the game next.</p><p>The impact of not getting Steam approval was recently shown when the developers of Horses shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">message about the studio's potential closure</a> because of that decision and their inability to make an appeal to Valve.</p>
