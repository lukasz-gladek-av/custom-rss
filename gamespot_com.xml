                <p>The battle royale genre dominated 2017. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, PUBG, Apex Legends, and other games came out around that time and took over the gaming zeitgeist. We're almost a decade out from the golden age of battle royales and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes it is the best shooter genre out there.</p><p>"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," Sweeney said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Battle royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented -- and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p>

<p>Sweeney also spoke about the fact that people still view Fortnite as just a battle royale and not an "everything game." Epic Games considers Fortnite a platform that includes creator-made modes as well as developer-created modes like Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing. Battle royale, including it's multiple spin-offs like Zero Build, is still the game's most popular mode.</p><p>"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><p>While Fortnite does include a number of other game types and genres, none have come close to the popularity level that battle royale has reached. In other Fortnite news, the game's Unreal Editor will soon get brick-by-brick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-is-getting-lego-brick-by-brick-building/1100-6532057/" data-ref-id="1100-6532057">Lego building.</a></p>

                <p>Next month marks the 43rd anniversary of the original Tron movie, but players won't have to wait any longer to reenter the Grid. Ahead of its full release later this month, the demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/" data-ref-id="1100-6531077" data-mce-href="/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/">Tron: Catalyst</a> has debuted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>According to Tron: Catalyst director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mike Bithell</a>, the demo covers roughly the first hour of the game. Bithell also noted that the game supports ultrawide monitors, which he felt was appropriate for the franchise.</p><p>Catalyst is a departure from Bithell Games' previous title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/" data-ref-id="1900-6418054" data-mce-href="/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/">Tron: Identity</a>. That game was essentially an interactive cyberpunk novel, while Tron: Catalyst has switched genres to isometric action. Players will be able to utilize their Identity Discs and their Light Cycles while facing The Core, a militant faction that's holding on to power in the Arq Grid.</p><p>It's unclear if Tron himself will make any kind of appearance in the game, as players will be stepping into the role of a new hero named Exo. She's taken it upon herself to carry on Tron's legacy by protecting the Grid and doing everything she can to bring down The Core. Exo can face her enemies with melee moves, but her most versatile weapon remains her disc, which can be used for both offense and defense.</p><p>Tron: Catalyst will launch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on June 17. But it won't be the only Tron media coming this year. The next feature film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/" data-ref-id="1100-6525696" data-mce-href="/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/">Tron: Ares</a>, will hit theaters on October 10. Last year, the star of that film, Jared Leto, shared his experience at Walt Disney World where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/" data-ref-id="1100-6526123" data-mce-href="/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/">he rode the Tron: Lightcycle ride</a> for the first time.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's multiplayer shooter XDefiant has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-xdefiant-is-officially-shut-down/1100-6532087/" data-ref-id="1100-6532087">officially closed down</a>, and now game director Mark Rubin has announced he's leaving the games industry overall. He also discussed what he believes went wrong with the game, including claiming that Ubisoft gave the game "little to no marketing" and that Ubisoft didn't give the team enough resources to help it succeed after launch.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" rel="nofollow ">post on social media</a>, Rubin said, "It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game." He said he thanks fans for playing and promoting it. "Every voice mattered," he said.</p><p>"I would say something remarkable happened with this game in that although we had very little marketing, we still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title just from you guys all talking about and promoting the game," Rubin said.</p><p>He's likely referring to how XDefiant was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d2mt2e/8_million_people_played_xdefiant/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported to have reached 8 million players in its first week</a>. That momentum was not sustained, and Rubin blamed this in part on Ubisoft providing "little to no marketing" support, especially after launch.</p><p>Some may question this claim, as Ubisoft regularly promoted XDefiant before and after launch, and the game featured characters based on Ubisoft's biggest franchises, including Far Cry, The Division, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed, and Watch Dogs. On YouTube, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/search?query=xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published more than two-dozen XDefiant videos</a> aimed at hyping the game. The game's social media pages had <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of thousands of followers</a> that received all the newest details as they were announced.</p><p>However, Rubin said XDefiant failed to acquire new users after its big launch, and contributed to the game's downfall.</p><p>Other issues that XDefiant faced included "crippling tech debt" in the form of the XDefiant developers "using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that."</p><p>Rubin went on to question whether or not proprietary game engines make sense anymore. "This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he said. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn't handle it and you would have a bad experience."</p><p>The developer added that his team also struggled to have "the right resources to make content for the game." He said Seasons 4 and 5 would have "completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch," but the team did not have the resources to deliver it.</p><p>He said XDefiant's developers and Ubisoft leadership had their hearts "in the right place," but the game struggled because, "We just didn't have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p>Some may also wonder about external factors that could have contributed to XDefiant's inability to sustain and grow its audience. It's been reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/10-live-service-games-made-up-more-than-40-of-last-months-us-playtime-on-playstation-and-xbox/1100-6529723/" data-ref-id="1100-6529723">huge percentage of total play time in multiplayer games is dominated by only a few titles</a>, making it challenging for new games to break through.</p><p>XDefiant's development team was laid off in 2024, including Rubin, and he's now leaving the gaming industry overall to spend time with his family.</p><p>"So unfortunately you won't be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say," he said.</p><p>Rubin rose to fame in the gaming industry for his work on the Call of Duty series. He was a producer on the hugely popular 2007 game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, before producing its sequels as well. He left Infinity Ward after Call of Duty: Ghosts came out in 2013.</p>

<p>"The Kingdom Come kind of simulation ... there's so many options, you can change the world, it's super great," Badowski continued. "We'd like to follow this trend as well. So these are our next steps for sure, and it's kind of a similar challenge to what we have in The Witcher 3 because of the open world and storytelling here, freedom of choices. But at the same time, we would like to build very fleshy, very well-motivated characters. So it's kind of in contradiction from time to time. That's a great design challenge."</p><p>Badowski doesn't think Larian's D&amp;D blockbuster Baldur's Gate 3 has as much in common with the CDPR style. "It's turn-based so it's a different kind of game, and the way you interact with characters is totally different," Badowski explains. "Because there's freedom of choice in Larian's work, it pushes you to use different tricks than ours. But I think we observe each other, and there are not that many games like that, so ... we see how players react to those tactics."</p><p>CDPR co-CEO also expressed admiration for Baldur's Gate 3, even though it's different from what the studio wants to do with The Witcher and Cyberpunk. "We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did," Nowakowski said. "That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how the characters can interact with the world and what it does was for sure some inspiration to us."</p><p>CD Projekt Red just released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">gorgeous-looking new tech demo</a> for The Witcher 4 as part of State of Unreal 2025, though the actual game still seems to be a while off.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Nightreign has been widely recognized as a difficult game with bosses that can easily kill you with any number of attacks. But just as people struggled with Margot during the opening of Elden Ring, there is a near-endless amount of room for improvement. As Ishizaki says, you'll eventually succeed if you stick with it.</p><p>Richard Wakeling applauded From Software and the studio's creative approach to multiplayer in his GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">review of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p><p>"Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement was a genuine surprise. The details explaining the kind of game it was were even more surprising," he wrote. "This peculiar mix of a From Software RPG spliced with elements of roguelites and battle royales sounds like the kind of experimental concept no game studio would actually devote money to. But here's From Software, tapping into its creativity to put its own weird, bold spin on a thrilling cooperative multiplayer experience. Even if the end result were middling, this is the kind of risk worth celebrating, but doubly so now that it turned out to be such a fantastic, anomalous <em>thing</em>. The part of From Software's collective brain that created oddities like Metal Wolf Chaos and Otogi: Myth of Demons is still very much alive and well."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-include-promised-improvements-for-solo-play/1100-6531974/" data-ref-id="1100-6531974">Nightreign's most recent patch</a> brought several changes and fixes to the difficulty of solo play in the multiplayer roguelike. The patch adds the "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat" effect that allows players to revive once per nighttime boss battle.</p>
