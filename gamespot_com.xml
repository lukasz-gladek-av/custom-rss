Any chest or loot source has a chance to obtain a version of Mirror Imago, but one of the easiest ways to guarantee a drop of it is by using the Tome of Want. The Tome's scripture slots can be set to guarantee a drop of Mirror Imago using the first and second slots by selecting the appropriate Scriptures in their respective slots.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_God_Rolls">Mirror Imago God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458567" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458567"></a><figcaption>The new Mirror Imago submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_PvE_God_Roll">Mirror Imago PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel:</strong> Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability / +5 Handling / +5 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine:</strong> Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk:</strong> Subsistence  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating targets partially reloads the magazine from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk:</strong> Sword Logic  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows with this weapon grant bonus damage.

Because this is an adaptive-frame-type weapon, its rate of fire means it's easy to clear a room of smaller enemies. As the damage stacks up from Sword Logic, the weapon only gets stronger so long as bigger enemies keep being downed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_PvP_God_Roll">Mirror Imago PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel:</strong> Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Range / +7 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine:</strong> Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+1 Magazine / +10 Reload Speed / +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk:</strong> Pugilist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows with this weapon generate melee energy.

Because Guardian kills count as the strongest type of target, the buff from Sword Logic will always remain at the highest damage possible rather than building up to that point.</p><hr><p>Don't forget to also check out or guides on the new sidearm <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/" data-ref-id="1100-6530084">Lotus Eater</a> and how players can find bonus loot in the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-beat-destiny-2-court-of-blades-and-earn-bonus-loot/1100-6530061/" data-ref-id="1100-6530061">Court of Blades</a> activity in Destiny 2.</p>

Lara herself will cost 1,500 V-Bucks, while her various accessories range from 300-800 V-Bucks. Lara's entire Tomb Raider package comes to 2,200 V-Bucks, excluding the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon.

This Legendary Arc trace rifle is far more effective in PvE than PvP activities due to the perks it can roll with. Having said that, Keraunios also receives plenty of buffs from Heresy Artifact, as it focuses on Arc abilities and damage output. Here's how to get it and the Keraunios god roll perks to look out for.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</a><ul><li><a href="#Keraunios_god_rolls_">Keraunios god rolls </a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</h2><p dir="ltr">Keraunios can drop from any Guardian Games weapons source, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rushdown-guide-boss-rush-challenge-rewards-and-encounters-explained/1100-6530070/">Rushdown </a>or by completing objectives given by Eva Levante in the Tower for the duration of the event. Doing the Rushdown mode is the most effective way to get your hands on Keraunios quickly, as if you defeat at least three bosses in a single run, you're guaranteed a Guardian Games weapon drop. Keraunios is exclusive to Guardian Games, so remember that once the event is over, you will no longer be able to obtain it. At least, not until 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Guardian Games event challenges also include a guaranteed Keraunios drop. All you need to do is earn and deposit any medal from the games in the Tower event area. Completing the first step in the Best in Class quest, collected from Eva Levante, will also give you a Keraunios. Remember that you need to equip or use the Guardian Games class item as an ornament for rewards to drop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412"></a><figcaption>Keraunios</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_god_rolls_"><span>Keraunios god rolls</span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Light Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">Handling +10, Reload Speed +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Recycled Energy or Eddy Current  <ul><li dir="ltr">Recycled Energy: Reloading after defeating targets grants energy to your lowest charged ability.</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current: Temporarily increases reload speed and handling after sprinting or while Amplified.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Jolting Feedback, Detonator Beam, or Rolling Storm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback: Dealing repeated damage applies Jolt.

As standard, it fires accurate bursts of Arc energy at enemies, but with the right roll it turns into a lethal laser gun. Adding secondary effects, such as Jolt, increases the amount of outgoing damage as well as having the ability to disrupt enemy attacks. While we've opted to improve the handling of the weapon, you can also Masterwork its reload speed to complement the Light Battery, and we'd recommend this option first if you chose Eddy Current over Recycled Energy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +7, Stability +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Projection Fuse  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Dynamic Sway Reduction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves accuracy and stability while continuously holding down the trigger.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Masterwork: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">From our selections above, it might seem obvious that we're aiming for a huge increase on the Keraunios' average range. In a fast-paced PvP environment, it's not the strongest weapon you can take to the Crucible. It's still impressive and has the potential to put up a fight against the most formidable Guardians. Closing Time is great for boosting stats that will help you win in close fights, including range, although the magazine needs to be half-empty in order for it to trigger, so don't get too enthusiastic with your manual reloading.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for other new guns, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/">Lotus Eater sidearm god rolls</a>.

According to Warner Bros. Discovery, the trailer has reached 158 million views across all platforms over its first three days.

The network did not reveal, however, what the previous biggest trailer was.</p><p>WBD said the new trailer is pacing ahead of previous trailers and teasers by at least 160%. The newest trailer was perhaps the best one yet, showing off the growing rift between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey). The trailer also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-brings-back-spores-for-a-dramatic-reason/1100-6530032/" data-ref-id="1100-6530032">spores are back</a> and showed The Matrix actor Joe Pantoliano's character, Eugene, for the first time.

Young Mazino plays Jesse, Isabela Merced portrays Dina, and Catherine O'Hara appears as Joel's therapist. Additionally, Jeffrey Wright stars in Season 2 as Isaac, the character he played in The Last of Us: Part II.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres Sunday, April 13, on HBO/Max. There will be seven episodes in all for Season 2, down from nine for Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-series-may-end-after-four-seasons-says-hbo-boss/1100-6529478/" data-ref-id="1100-6529478">At least two more seasons</a> are expected to follow.</p><p>Season 2 is expected to elicit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/" data-ref-id="1100-6515962">"furor"</a> over some of the choices and changes the creative team made.

                <p>Act II of Destiny 2: Episode Heresy has dropped and brought with it some new toys to have fun with. A new rocket-assisted-frame sidearm has arrived in the form of Lotus Eater. This new Void element weapon is another excellent addition to the archetype--however you get your hands on one, a rocket sidearm is a great asset, and this is the first Void rocket sidearm to be released. Here's how players can find it and what the god roll perks for Lotus Eater are.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Lotus_Eater">How to get Lotus Eater</a></li><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_God_Rolls">Lotus Eater God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_PvE_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Lotus_Eater_PvP_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Lotus_Eater">How to get Lotus Eater</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458352"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458352-3922217119.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lotus Eater is only available as a drop from Nightfalls or Grandmaster Nightfalls when the weapon is a part of the weekly rotation. At the end of a Nightfall run, it has a chance to drop. Each difficulty tier has a particular percentage to drop Lotus Eater, but the easiest way to guarantee a drop to happen is to complete a Grandmaster Nightfall with a Platinum score. Achieving a Platinum score on Grandmaster will guarantee a drop for the Adept variation of Lotus Eater while it is on rotation, which offers increased stats and curated rolls.</p><p dir="ltr">After Episode Heresy has concluded and the next expansion is available, Lotus Eater will also be available to unlock via spending Nightfall Ciphers at Zavala in the Tower.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_God_Rolls">Lotus Eater God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_PvE_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Quick Launch  <ul><li>+10 Velocity / +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magazine:</strong> High Explosive Ordnance  <ul><li>+10 Blast Radius / +5 Velocity / -3 Magazine</li></ul></li><li><strong>First Perk:</strong> Repulsor Brace  <ul><li>Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Second Perk:</strong> Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li>Defeating a target creates a Void burst; hitting other targets with this burst makes them volatile and grants you Volatile Rounds for a short duration.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Ideally this perk combination maximizes blast radius of rounds and makes passing out the Volatile debuff happen incredibly fast. Combined with the fact that Volatile works off of chain explosions, this can spread to clear large swathes of enemies in seconds. When used with a Void subclass, that will work in concert with Aspects such as Devour and collecting Void Breaches, making this weapon incredibly good for taking out groups. The Repulsor Brace perk also makes the user much stronger in a prolonged fight as the overshield is constantly refilling, thus allowing more damage to be taken.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lotus_Eater_PvP_God_Roll">Lotus Eater PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Linear Compensator  <ul><li>+5 Stability / +5 Blast Radius / +5 Velocity</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magazine:</strong> High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li>+10 Velocity / +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li><strong>First Perk:</strong> Beacon Rounds  <ul><li>Final blows with this weapon grant your projectiles tracking and increase reload speed.

Combined with added tracking from Beacon Rounds and the ability to weaken from Withering Gaze, this weapon will synergize well with Void builds that use melee or short range Void abilities. Weaken will make the target more susceptible to damage and prevent healing from going off quickly, so it leaves targets extremely vulnerable while debuffed.</p>

                <p>The long-rumored remake of Bethesda's 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion could be announced soon and potentially release before June. That's according to NateTheHate, who has a solid track record of reporting on unannounced games and platforms.</p><p>Asked to say when more information about the rumored Oblivion remake might arrive, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NateTheHate said</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-launch-before-june-rumor/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via The Gamer</a>) that fans can expect details either this month or in April. As for when the game could be released, NateTheHate said it could be "likely sooner than the original June target." However, NateTheHate said the situation is fluid and there is no concrete information to go on at this stage.</p><p>Some thought Microsoft and Bethesda would reveal an Oblivion remake during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct in January, but that did not happen.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411" data-ratio="0.60619872379216" data-width="1097" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411"></a><figcaption>Is an Oblivion remake/remaster in the works?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg"></figure><p>The rumor dates back to documents from the Microsoft vs. FTC case in 2023 concerning the Xbox company's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. An "Oblivion Remaster" was listed as an upcoming unannounced Bethesda game for release in financial year 2022. Obviously, that did not happen, and Bethesda has yet to announce a remake or remaster of Oblivion. </p><p>There is no word on potential platforms for the rumored Oblivion remake. While Bethesda is releasing some of its games on rival platforms, like this May's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, Bethesda's biggest game in recent times, Starfield, is still exclusive to Xbox and PC. </p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>While an official remake of Oblivion has yet to be announced,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672"> there is a fan-made Oblivion remake, Skyblivion, coming in 2025.</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

                <p>If you have pleasant memories of blasting the Covenant round after round with your buddies in Halo's Firefight, we've got good news for you. A recent update to Halo Infinite has introduced old-school Firefight back into the game, a mode that was first introduced in Halo 3: ODST.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled "Firefight Classic," it's a round-based mode where you and three squadmates team up to take out endless waves of enemies. This version of the classic mode features rounds of five waves each, with three rounds adding up to a "set." Your team shares a pool of seven lives, and when they're all used up, you're done for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A_SBMoeezc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8A_SBMoeezc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's Firefight Classic gives you the previously unavailable option to end a session at the conclusion of a set. If two of your teammates go into a zone that's labelled "complete the mission," your team will be extracted. If you choose to continue, each set introduces a new Skull on rounds two and three, which adds a new flavor to the proceedings.</p><p dir="ltr">This mode also comes with a suite of Forge maps to try out Firefight Classic, including remakes of Halo 3: ODST's Alpha Site and Security Zone, as well as Halo: Reach's Courtyard. The update that introduced Firefight Classic, Operation: Blue Team, also includes a number of other additions, including the new map Nemesis, the PvP mode Hot Swap, and a fresh battle pass.</p>

Some of your tea requests are fairly straightforward, but others are a bit harder to complete.

Interacting with the shrine will advance you to Chapter 2, so if you're still planting or enjoying your time here, you can choose to wait and visit the shrine later. <strong>Interacting with the shrine will reset all of your farming</strong> and rearrange the garden a bit.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2_tea_requests">Chapter 2 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458337" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458337"></a><figcaption>Bat customer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Boro asks you to add plants to his hanging flower pots. This is a pretty easy task. Just grab an empty pot from the shop and then transfer plants into the hanging pots.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Bring any item to trade for something of Nana's.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a tea request, but you'll need to trade an item with Nana. This can be anything from a cup, a seed, or a trinket you found. You can return to her two more times to trade and receive items.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A fruit flavor that brings to mind "passion"</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This feels misleading, because all of the fruit ingredients list various effects in your field guide, but nothing mentions being related to passion in any way. This request seems to refer to your own passion, and you can brew a tea with any fruit to appease Ren.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crafty_customer">Crafty customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Something that helps with chest pain</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Snok Cone and a Pellmelon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Silver Moonlight Tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Messberry, Chip Chip, Pellmelon, and any type of mushroom.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Take five photos and hang them up around the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This is another easy task. Boro will instruct you to use his camera to take pictures around the shop. You need to take five and place them in the blank photo frames hanging inside the shop.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bat_customer">Bat customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Book tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a book. You find various books as trinkets while tending the tea shop. Sometimes, they are gifts in the mailbox, found while sweeping leaf piles, or given to you by guests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bat_customer">Bat customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Miracle Pomme</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with Miracle Pomme fruit. At Boro's suggestion, you can add two additional fruits for color. This isn't a requirement, but it may give you different dialogue results.</p><p dir="ltr">To get Miracle Pomme fruit, you'll first need to breed the Weyling Tree with three Hue Shrooms. Watering this new plant will give you a color-swapped Weyling Tree that produces the Miracle Pomme fruit.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request </strong>- Any</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Any</p><p dir="ltr">If this objective isn't available to you, and all other quests are complete, try brewing yourself a cup of tea and drinking it. Not sure if this is a glitch, but I seemed stuck and unable to progress until I drank tea. Then, Ren reappeared for his final interaction before I was able to use the shrine again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3_tea_requests">Chapter 3 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458335"></a><figcaption>View of the Wanderstop shrine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a brief story beat, you'll return to the tea shop.

Jerry insists on Coffee</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee. This is just boiling water and coffee.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The coffee requests can't be completed until you first finish Zenith's initial tea request</strong>. So, don't stress if you took the orders for the coffee guys first, but you'll need to speak with Zenith to progress.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terry">Terry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Coffee with a fruit containing as little flavor as possible</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Biteberry.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Larry">Larry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Cold coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: This is just coffee and water without boiling it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea made with something of value</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>Brew tea with any other ingredient.

Just place cups of tea near five different Pluffins.</p><p dir="ltr">This can be any tea recipe, but I'd <strong>recommend something like the Painted Gourd</strong> fruit to change the birds to an orange color. The mint tea made it hard to tell which birds I'd already given the tea to.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Harry">Harry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Mintiatto coffee. Tastes like mint and ice cream.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Chip Chip and Painted Gourd.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A tea made from a fruit, the plant the fruit came from, and a seed used to grow the plant.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This can be any one fruit of your choosing. However, you also need the plant and the seed associated with that specific fruit. In order to include the plant itself into the mix, you'll first need to take the plant and surround it with three of the blue Shrink Shrooms. Grab a pot and place the shrunken plant into the pot. Then, brew the tea with the fruit, the potted plant, and the seed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Garry">Garry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Coffee</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee.

Pour all of the coffee into the cup. Then, leave this cup sitting.</p><p dir="ltr">For the second brew, you don't want to boil the water. Instead, get the color of the bar to yellow. Then, add the Weyling Fruit, a Sweet Meelium, and a clean coffee bean. Pour this second brew on top of the original cup of coffee you made.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Gross tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> This can be anything. I even added a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Boro wants you to add plants to all the large pots inside the shop. This is easy. You can re-pot some of the plants from outside, use your extra seeds, or even the coffee beans.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Nana wants stronger and even more complicated coffee with hints of cinnamon.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Again, this is a two-part process for Nana.</p><p dir="ltr">First brew, brew three clean coffee beans with hot water. Pour all of it into a cup. Leave the cup sitting there.</p><p dir="ltr">Second brew, you need to use warm water (only get the temperature to yellow) and add Weyling Fruit, a Pellmelon for the cinnamon, and a clean coffee bean. Pour this second brew on top of the original cup of coffee you made.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea that tastes like breakfast cereal, sugar, and dirt.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone (for cereal flavor), a Whistleberry (for sugar) and a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fairy">Fairy</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Aeon Brew</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> The fairy is now making Nana's orders look easy. <strong>The order of ingredients and time on this one are very specific</strong>. Have a timer ready.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a cold brew, so make sure you don't heat the water at all. You need to add a Dupe Shroom, a Waypur Sprout, a color-swapped Puffpod, a Blue Loop, a Tea Ball, and then<strong> let the ingredients sit one minute</strong> before adding a second Tea Ball as the final ingredient.</p><p dir="ltr">Remember, to color-swap the Puffpod you'll need to add three Hue Shrooms around the plant.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea Request - </strong>Breakfast cereal and sugar</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone and Whistleberry.</p><p dir="ltr">All the trophies/achievements are tied to the story, so by working through all the chapter requests, you should now have all of Wanderstop's achievements/trophies.</p>
