The publisher has teased a free DLC for Fantasy Life i that will introduce a new roguelike open world for the game. And that's not the only change on the way.</p><p>On Fantasy Life i's official social media channels, Level-5 said that the new roguelike open world will be built for "newcomers and veterans alike." It also featured an image of a new character that will be introduced in the game. Few details were revealed about him, but he is described as someone "who will play a vital role in the story."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1935678003675279425" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Free DLC Update Info<br>An evolved version of Ginormosia is coming, featuring a<br>üî• Roguelike Open World üî• for newcomers and veterans alike!<br>We‚Äôre also revealing a new character who will play a vital role in the story.<br>Doesn't he remind you of someone on Ginormosia...? üêª<br>The team‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/Af9NbSYklJ" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Af9NbSYklJ</a></p>  ‚Äî FANTASY LIFE Series (@FANTASYLIFE_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1935678003675279425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-to-add-new-mode-roguelike-open-world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a> shared additional details about what players can expect from the DLC.

                <p>Earlier this week, Robin "DarkOne" Scott announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nexus-mods-changing-owners-after-two-decades-but-will-remain-community-first-founder-says/1100-6532457/" data-ref-id="1100-6532457">he sold Nexus Mods</a> to a new owner, ending his nearly 24 years as the leader of the site that he founded in 2001. Scott has indicated that he will remain with Nexus Mods in some capacity while guiding the overall direction of the site. The new owner, Chosen, has also spoken out to assure fans that the valuable resource won't be adding "aggressive monetization" or suddenly place mods behind a paywall.</p><p>Referred to by their Nexus Mods names in a statement from Scott, Foledinho (Victor), Rapsak (Marinus), and Taagen (Nikolai) are the three partners in Nexus Mods' ownership under <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chosen</a>. This led to fears among players that they collectively plan to monetize the site and exploit the user base for short-term gains. In <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on Nexus Mods</a>, Foledinho told fans that "mods will always be free."</p><p>For the most part, Foledinho's message was that few things would change. He went on to say that Chosen doesn't claim ownership of any mods, nor will it charge users to download them. Foledinho indicated that Lifetime Premium subscriptions and free accounts will stay as they are, and he expressed admiration for the way Scott monetized the site in 2007.</p><p>"Honestly, we think it was done right," noted Foledinho. "It enabled healthy growth while supporting the community. We have no plans to change the core of how Premium works. It gives users choice based on their needs--and that‚Äôs a good thing."</p><p>"Monetization is hard and Nexus Mods is a complex platform," added Foledinho. "What matters most is continuing to support mod authors, delight users, and keep the lights on. We're not changing the core model. No aggressive monetization. No paid mods. If anything, we're aiming for fewer ads, not more. We'll take a community-first, listening approach, and we won't compromise on what's made Nexus Mods special."</p><p>In a follow-up message, Chosen affirmed its commitment to maintaining the diversity and inclusion approach that Scott embraced during his ownership stint.</p><p>For now, Chosen seems to have said all the right things to assure fans that nothing will fundamentally change. However, Foledinho didn't specify how the leadership team plans to reduce ads on the site without losing the income they bring in.</p>

                <p>The Switch 2 hasn't even been out for a month yet, but Nintendo is already taking strong measures to make sure pirates can't use the company's new console. Switch 2 owners are sharing stories online that their systems have been banned after using a third-party cartridge that some players have reportedly used for illegal ROMs.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Nintendo has been targeting systems that have used a MIG Switch cartridge, which can store ROMs that were either illicitly obtained or downloaded from players' personal libraries. Nintendo doesn't appear to have drawn a distinction about how the ROMs ended up in players' hands. If Nintendo detects the MIG Switch, the consoles in question are banned from going online forever.</p><p>The YouTube channel Scattered Brain shared its own report about the issue, and notes that even restoring the Switch 2 to factory settings can't undo the ban. Nintendo considers using the MIG Switch cartridge a violation of the Switch 2 End User License Agreement, and the penalty is a pricey lesson for anyone who doesn't heed the warning.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExgYTA18_vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In retrospect, these measures shouldn't be too surprising considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went to great lengths to find an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year who the company accused of selling hardware hacks and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games. Former Switch pirate Gary Bowser was also hit with prison time and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-claims-his-case-serves-as-a-message-to-other-pirates/1100-6520791/" data-ref-id="1100-6520791">a multi-million judgment against him</a>, which he will be paying to Nintendo for the foreseeable future.</p>

According to data from Circana, cited by The Game Business, 81% of physical Nintendo Switch 2 game sales were for first-party titles, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World</a> and the Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. NielsenIQ reports Cyberpunk 2077 has been the best-selling third-party game on Switch 2 so far, while Circana's data reveals Sega is the third-biggest Switch 2 game publisher.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Every Switch 2 Launch Game</p>
      </div>
<p>Circana executive director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that "Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%," which is almost double what third-party games did at the launch of the Switch 1. The Game Business did point out that improvement over the performance of third-party games on the original Switch, but also explains that "it's hard to describe these statistics as positive." That's understandable, considering the Switch 2 has had one of the most successful console launches of all time, yet an anonymous publisher is claiming that even its lowest estimates overestimated how well third-party games would do on Switch 2.</p><p>The release of this information has caused discussions over the negative impact of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Cards</a>, which are physical game cartridges that don't contain a game's full data and still require a download. Kelsey Lewin, owner of Seattle game retailer Pink Gorilla Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kelslewin.bsky.social/post/3lrxrv3h7h222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Bluesky</a> that Game-Key Card sales have flagged. "We had very low expectations carrying these in-store but can anecdotally confirm: no one is buying these," Lewin wrote</p><p>Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad is less bullish on the idea that Game-Key Cards had a negative impact on third-party Switch 2 sales. "I hate to break it to people, but the 'I refuse to buy a game for my Nintendo Switch 2 if the physical version is not on the cart' crowd are both a minority today and will be an even smaller minority in five years," he <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1935721809657127138" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>.</p><p>While the third-party numbers on Switch 2 aren't very promising thus far, we'll see how these games perform in the coming months and years as more brand-new games come to the platform.</p>
