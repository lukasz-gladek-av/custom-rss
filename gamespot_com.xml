                <p>Remedy Entertainment confirmed during a livestream that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-fbc-firebreak-is-more-left-4-dead-than-live-service-and-thats-the-beauty-of-it/1100-6530228/" data-ref-id="1100-6530228">multiplayer Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak</a> will be released on June 17 and will receive ample free post-launch support afterward.</p><p>The livestream provided a deeper look at the three-player co-op shooter's gameplay, including a mission, or "Job," that players can complete called Hot Fix. We also got a look at the Requisitions system, which serves as FBC: Firebreak's main form of progression and is similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2's</a> Warbonds. By playing the game, players will be able to unlock new weapons, armor, equipment, and more using free in-game currency, although real money can be spent to access "Classified Requisitions" that obtain premium cosmetic items.</p><p>Though this is a battle pass-like system, Remedy says the game is designed to be anti-FOMO. In a recent preview, GameSpot's Mark Delaney said it's "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-fbc-firebreak-is-more-left-4-dead-than-live-service-and-thats-the-beauty-of-it/1100-6530228/" data-ref-id="1100-6530228">more [like] Left 4 Dead than [a] live-service game</a>," with no daily challenges and expiring passes that make players feel like they have to play it or fall behind.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Of course, the release date is the most exciting piece of news from the showcase, and Remedy revealed the different versions of FBC: Firebreak that will be available. Although it will be included in both PS Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's game catalogs from day one, players will be able to buy the standard edition of FBC: Firebreak for $40. This game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-will-feature-cross-play-multiplayer/1100-6530895/" data-ref-id="1100-6530895">will support cross-play</a>, so it won't matter where you or your friends play it.</p><p>A $10 Deluxe Edition upgrade will also be available and nets players The Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Firestarter Armor Set, a Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin, a Golden Firebreak spray, and access to the Firestarter Classified Requisition.</p><p>Remedy confirmed that at least two new Jobs will come to the game this year, with more new content on the way in 2026. While players will have to pay for Classified Requisitions, all playable content released post-launch will be free for players.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a> launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 17. Its developers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-dev-says-its-given-no-thought-to-switch-2-support-so-far/1100-6530274/" data-ref-id="1100-6530274">not considered a Nintendo Switch 2</a> port yet.</p>

                <p>The real journey in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> begins after you step out of the grimy Imperial City sewers and emerge in the world of Cyrodiil. Right from the start of the game, there are zero restrictions on where you can go, who you can meet, and what you can do. You can choose to follow the main story quest, which requires you to hand over the amulet the emperor entrusted to you before he died, or completely ignore the story and explore the new world before you.</p><p>If you're a veteran of Oblivion, then you likely have a solid idea of the best places to go first. However, if you're hopping into the game for the first time with the remaster, you might need some guidance. After all, the map is huge and offers some free fast travel destinations thousands of meters away right from the get-go.</p><p>So, what should you do first in Oblivion Remastered? Below, we'll offer a few specific directives on the best places to visit after emerging from the sewers. For so much more on the "new" game, use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full Oblivion Remastered guide</a>.</p><h2 id="Follow_the_Black_Road">Follow the Black Road</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482155"></a><figcaption>An overview of the Black Road</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png"></figure><p>There are several different roads that branch out from the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. The northwestern road is called the Black Road, and it leads to a major city called Chorrol. Along the Black Road, you'll be able to discover a plethora of different locations, such as caves to explore, small towns to see, and quests to start. The Black Road starts with a town called Weye, which is where you can begin the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-complete-go-fish-in-oblivion-remastered/2900-6500/" data-ref-id="2900-6500">Go Fish side quest</a> in Oblivion Remastered that rewards you with a particularly useful ring.</p><p>If you continue on the Black Road, you'll eventually run into Weynon Priory, which is where the first main story quest tells you to go. Here, you can speak to Jauffre and learn about why the emperor gave you the amulet in the first place.</p><p>However, you don't have to stop in Weynon Priory if you don't want to. Instead, you can head right past it and make your way into the city of Chorrol. This city is home to a number of interesting characters and several engaging side quests. It's also where you can join both the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Fighters_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Fighters Guild</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Mages_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Mages Guild</a>.</p><p>Unlike in Skyrim, there's not much of an initiation process to join either guild, so you can enter both of them in the northern part of Chorrol and join straight away. This allows you to accept new quests, meet new characters, and receive some new weapons, spells, and gear. Chorrol isn't the sole city where you can join these guilds, but it's one of the best places to start.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the Fighters Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png"></figure><p>The Black Road culminates with a location called Battlehorn Castle. Battlehorn Castle is nothing particularly special from the outside, but when you approach it, there will be a small war going on in front of its gates. If you manage to defeat all of the enemies trying to break down the gate, you'll actually receive the deed to Battlehorn Castle. This entitles you to full ownership of the castle and everything that it holds.</p><p>At the very least, Battlehorn Castle offers you free access to a blacksmith to repair your gear, a plethora of beds to sleep in so you can level up, and the possibility to design your own castle. You can talk to a merchant in Imperial City to buy blueprints for various upgrades around the castle to truly make it yours.</p><h2 id="Head_inside_the_North_Sewers">Head inside the North Sewers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the North Sewers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png"></figure><p>Just because you emerged from the sewers doesn't mean you can't head right back inside them. From the main sewer entrance in Oblivion Remastered, you can travel west to enter the North Exit of the sewers. Along the way, you might also find a Nirnroot Plant by the nearby lake, which triggers the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/seeking-your-roots-quest-guide-fo-oblivion-remastered/2900-6497/" data-ref-id="2900-6497">Seeking Your Roots quest</a>.</p><p>If you try to enter the North Sewers, you'll need to pick a Hard lock, which can certainly take a few attempts. Once you're inside, make your way through the tight corridors and caverns until you reach a ladder that allows you to head up to "The Main Ingredient" basement. You'll need to pick this lock as well as a lock that allows you to head into The Main Ingredient shop itself from the basement.</p><p>After getting through, though, you can speak to the proprietor of the shop, who's name is Oegir Goerick, and start the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/unfriendly-competition-quest-guide-for-oblivion-remastered/2900-6493/" data-ref-id="2900-6493">Unfriendly Competition quest</a>. This quest is quite the tangled web, but it winds up with you securing two of the best early-game melee weapons in Oblivion Remastered. You also receive some other gear as well as a general understanding of how the Imperial City is laid out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oegir Goerick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png"></figure><p>Emerging from the North Sewers allows you an easy way to get inside the heart of the Imperial City and start to explore it a little more. From there, you can go any way you please, explore the city until your heart is content, and head back down to the sewers and start from the way you came.</p><p>One of the best ways to spend your time in the Imperial City is to speak with NPCs and ask them about "Rumors." This lets you know of some major side quests and who to speak to next.</p><h2 id="Join_one_or_all_of_the_Guilds">Join one or all of the Guilds</h2><p>We've already talked about the Fighters and Mages Guilds in Oblivion Remastered, but those aren't the only two guilds you can join in Cyrodiil. You can also join the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Thieves_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Thieves Guild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Dark_Brotherhood" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Dark Brotherhood</a>, both of which require you to perform a specific action instead of visiting a location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178"></a><figcaption>Teekeeus is the head of the Chorrol Mages Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png"></figure><p>For the Thieves Guild, you can either commit a crime and choose the option to go to jail, become friends with a beggar by giving them coin and asking about the guild, or find the guild on your own through The Grey Fox. Regardless of how you do it, the Thieves Guild offers some great quests and rewards in Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>You could also join the Dark Brotherhood, which is only doable after you murder an innocent person and then go to sleep in a bed. During your rest, an NPC named Lucien Lachance will approach you about joining.</p><p>In addition to all of the guilds in Oblivion Remastered, you can also join the Imperial Arena. This location is found within Imperial City and by speaking with Owyn, you can take part in Arena battles as a participant. The Arena allows you to fight enemies and soar through different ranks as you keep winning, which earns you new rewards in the process.</p><h2 id="Go_east_towards_Vilverin">Go east towards Vilverin</h2><p>The final direction we'll offer is to go east from the sewer entrance. Directly across the lake, you'll find an Aeylid Ruin by the name of Vilverin. If you travel inside Vilverin, you'll be able to loot a slew of interesting items. One of the more notable pieces of loot are Welkynd Stones, which allow you to instantly regain magicka points. They're also used as a conduit for shock spells, which come in handy if you join the Mages Guild in Chorrol.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179"></a><figcaption>The location of Vilverin </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png"></figure><p>Also inside Vilverin you'll find a number of chests with plenty of gold, some bandits to kill and loot, and a number of different areas to explore. After you're done with the Aeylid Ruin, you can exit and keep heading east along the Blue Road towards the city of Cheydinhal. There are branches of the Mages and Fighters Guild here as well and plenty of other quests to embark on.</p><p>You could also head slightly north from Vilverin and take the Silver Road to the city of Bruma. While Bruma isn't too exciting, it's certainly not a bad city to visit and explore either.</p>

So I'm begging you, please don't judge me too harshly and appreciate the fact that I am majorly humbling myself by writing about this. And, for those of you who also didn't realize you could do this, rest assured that you are in good-ish company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fields of Mistria's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fields-of-mistrias-second-major-update-march-2025/2900-6312/" data-ref-id="2900-6312">second major update</a> was released, bringing with it the lava caves biome. And did you know that, unlike me, you don't have to use your watering can and desperately hop around the cave's various rock formations to progress through it? In a post shared on the official Field of Mistria Instagram, the team behind the game revealed that players can use the game's rain spell to instantly solidify every single inch of lava on the floor. That's right. All of it. And although this feat takes a lot of mana if you want to do it on multiple levels, man oh man, it changes things--and saves my poor stamina bar.</p><p>Admittedly, I haven't played nearly as much Fields of Mistria since the game's second update dropped--I blame the absolutely wild number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">phenomenal games that have come out this year</a> for that. For this reason, I think I'm a <em>little</em> more justified in not picking up on this sooner. But as someone who delights in games that force you to think about things in more roundabout way (ie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo/" data-ref-id="5000-582009">Paranormasight</a>, etc.), I am kicking myself for not considering that I could use the rain spell down in the mines.</p><p>While this is probably the biggest "oh god, you can do that" to come from Mistria's Instagram page, I also highly recommend checking out all the other tips, too. For example, did you know that if you feed a mimic items, it will spit out valuable resources and simply disappear? I've also noticed quite a few folks who have struggled a bit with the slimes that shoot rocks at you down there. The trick to besting them? Swing your sword at the right time and send those rocks hurling right back at 'em; just two good shots should do it.</p><p>While NPC Studios remains hard at work on the already fantastic farming simulator, we at GameSpot are continuing to chug away on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/guides/">Field of Mistria guides</a>. Right now, it's one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-anticipated-games-leaving-early-access-in-2025/2900-6151/" data-ref-id="2900-6151">most anticipated games</a> that's scheduled to leave early access in 2025.</p>

                <p>Former Xbox-console-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/" data-ref-id="5000-533238">Forza Horizon 5</a> sounds like it will run great on the PlayStation 5, and will be particularly impressive for those playing on PS5 Pro, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-forza-horizon-5-rolls-onto-ps5-and-ps5-pro-the-df-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the PS5 version of the open-world racer that first released in 2021 isn't set to release on PlayStation 5 until April 29, the performance-breakdown wizards at Digital Foundry have already put the PS5 version of Forza Horizon 5 through its paces ahead of its release. The good news: They largely have nothing but positive things to say.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ceExNpBQA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/82ceExNpBQA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While its visual performance on the base PS5 seems nearly identical to its performance on Xbox Series X|S (Digital Foundry says there's virtually no visual distinction and that they struggled to differentiate the two side-by-side), that's still an achievement given the series the franchise's ForzaTech engine has never run on PlayStation devices before. The game runs at a constant 30fps in quality mode and a steady 60fps during performance mode, and Digital Foundry says developer Panic Button's PS5 port is a "near-perfect match" to the Xbox Series X|S version.</p><p dir="ltr">It's playing the game on the PS5 Pro where the real differences can be seen. Digital Foundry notes that there is a "huge difference" in the amount of foliage when playing on PS5 Pro while running Forza Horizon 5 in performance mode. Greenery is denser and more vibrant, and can also be seen in higher detail from farther away with less pop-in. The foliage rendering while in performance mode closely matches that of the foliage on display on the base PS5's quality mode, meaning PS5 Pro players get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Getting quality mode foliage at performance mode frame rates is a huge bonus for Pro users, and provides a big visual boost over the base machine," Digital Foundry said.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few other perks for those playing on PS5 Pro as well, such as ray-traced self-vehicle reflections while playing in quality mode during normal gameplay--a feature that is normally only available while using the garage and Forzavista feature on base consoles. Digital Foundry found the reflections "noticeable" for those looking for it, but that it isn't hugely impactful. Overall, Digital Foundry called playing Forza Horizon 5 on the PS5 Pro a "compromise-free experience."

Developer Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's racing series is just the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to Sony's consoles, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-doing-phenomenally-on-ps5-sells-1-million-copies-already-report/1100-6526047/" data-ref-id="1100-6526047">Sea of Thieves</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, having also been released on PlayStation.</p>

                <p>The talk of the town currently in gaming is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, but it might not be the only RPG remaster from Bethesda. A report said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a>, and now one of the game's original designers, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/16256/bruce-nesmith/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bruce Nesmith</a>, has commented on what he'd like to see from it.</p><p>Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a> that he'd like to see Fallout 3's gunplay improved upon to make it more like Fallout 4's. "[Fallout 3 combat] didn't hold up to shooters at the time," he said. "Also, it's an RPG shooter; it's not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they're doing the same thing."</p><p>Nesmith pointed out that Fallout 3 marked Bethesda's first big stab at a shooter-style game, and the gunplay was not ideal.</p><p>A Fallout 3 remaster could also beef up the visuals of the 2008 game, Nesmith said. The Oblivion remaster didn't just make the game visually in line with the 2011 version of Skyrim--it exceeded it, Nesmith said. He said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/" data-ref-id="1100-6531057">pleasantly surprised by the work that went into Oblivion Remastered.</a></p><p>A report said the rumored Fallout 3 remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">would not launch for a long time</a>, so anyone hoping to play it soon should probably give up hope about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>--so it's not going to launch soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered is currently on sale for 17% off at GameSpot sister-site Fanatical (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom).</p><p>In other Fallout news, new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-fallout-76-update-is-live-letting-players-finally-become-a-ghoul/1100-6530194/">Fallout 76 finally allows players to become Ghouls</a>. The online RPG saw a resurgence last year after the premiere of Amazon Prime Video's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-amazon-show-review-of-the-people-for-the-people/1900-6418209/" data-ref-id="1900-6418209">Fallout TV show</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced quite a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to Cyrodiil, but one classic feature from the original 2006 version of the game has undeniably remained: extremely cursed character faces.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, most of the horrifying faces in the original Oblivion belonged to NPCs. Player-characters often ended up looking a bit off as well, but the player-character's face wasn't featured as prominently in the original game as it is in the remaster, nor was third-person mode as polished as it is in the latest version of the game, so the game's wonky NPC faces tended to overshadow whatever horrors players put together in the character creator. In Oblivion Remastered, however, many of the game's NPCs have had glow-ups, while the game's character creator has given players more flexibility to turn the Hero of Kvatch into an utter monstrosity. There's even a subreddit where players can share said monstrosities: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OblivionAbominations/" rel="nofollow ">/r/OblivionAbominations</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Oblivion Remastered's updated character creator makes it far easier for players to create <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6aau5/i_made_a_beautiful_orc_lady/" rel="nofollow ">visually appealing characters</a>, but it also makes it easier for players to create characters that are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6becp/you_are_the_one_from_my_dreams/" rel="nofollow ">pure nightmare fuel</a>. Almost immediately following the game's surprise release, social media started filling up with screenshots of player-character designs that make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/167oww7/why_do_the_characters_look_like_that_im_scared/" rel="nofollow ">the bug-eyed NPCs</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> look downright friendly. Here are some of our favorites.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sir Vancelot</h3><p>Arguably the most popular horrifying player-character, Sir Vancelot has started appearing all over social media since his creator first shared him.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dumb and Dunmer</h3><p>This delightfully horrifying dark elf is truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Shrek</h3><p>This particular orc (...that <em>is</em> an orc, right?) is giving off major "Shrek had a few too many filler injections" vibes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Yu-Gi-Oh My God</h3><p>It's nothing if not accurate.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Janker</h3><p>Some men just want to watch the Oblivion Gate burn.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Not-So-Handsome Squidward</h3><p>Someone free him from his suffering.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Jimmy No-Tron</h3><p>Depends on one's definition of gorgeous.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Orange-In-Chief</h3><p dir="ltr">"This is a really, really great Oblivion player-character. The best, really terrific. No fake news here. Other player-characters? Losers! Total disasters. Everyone agrees. Believe me."</p><h3 dir="ltr">I Have No Eyes And I Must Flush</h3><p>50% orc, 50% sleep-paralysis demon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Crimson Chin Deathclaw</h3><p>He looks even more hilarious with his armor on.</p><p dir="ltr">Which Oblivion abomination is your favorite?
