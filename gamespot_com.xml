                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>

      </div>
<p>The alpha test requires all players to have a Bungie.net account, and presumably the full release will, as well. A PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live account is not required to play the alpha test, but will be once Marathon officially launches. Friend invites are not supported during the alpha, although friends will be able to group up with each other if they were selected participants.</p><p>The alpha is approximately 6GB and only supports the English language. However, Bungie plans on supporting the full game with many additional languages. Additionally, account progress from the alpha will be deleted from test servers when they're closed and will not be saved for launch.</p><p>Marathon launches on September 23, and will support both cross-play and cross-save. While Marathon won't be full price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it'll be a premium title</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">reports that it'll be $40</a>.

                <p>In 2022, Rockstar Games introduced GTA+, a subscription service that provides a variety of perks and bonuses in GTA Online. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">GTA 5 Enhanced bringing GTA+ to PC for the first time recently</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s release coming up this year, we're running through everything you need to know about GTA +. Do you really need to sign up for yet another subscription service? Only you can answer that, but below you'll find a breakdown of the key facts about GTA+ to help you decide.</p><h2 id="What_Is_GTA__"><strong>What Is GTA+?</strong></h2><p>GTA+ is a subscription service for GTA Online that originally debuted in March 2022 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The subscription offering came to PC for the first time with GTA 5 Enhanced's launch in March 2025. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">GTA 5 Enhanced now available for PC Game Pass</a>, you can subscribe to GTA+ from within Game Pass. That's right: a subscription within a subscription.</p><h2 id="Free_Games_And_Other_Perks"><strong>Free Games And Other Perks</strong></h2><p>To begin with, every GTA+ subscriber gets 500,000 worth of GTA$ deposited automatically into their in-game accounts monthly based on their billing date. Members also get a 15% bonus in GTA$ for Shark Card purchases, while they also earn GTA$ multipliers for certain GTA Online missions and modes. Subscribers also get discounts on in-game items, with discounted wares varying month by month.</p><p>GTA+ members also get access to The Vinewood Car Club where they can claim free vehicles. Also in terms of vehicles, subscribers get a 100-car garage, spread across five floors.</p><p>Members receive monthly benefits--for April 2025, Rockstar is offering the Bollokan Envisage sports car, special clothing items, and vehicle liveries. You can <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus/benefits" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit this page</a> to see the current month's special bonuses for subscribers.</p><p>Another major perk of signing up for GTA+ is getting access to the GTA+ Games Library. This is a rotating selection of classic Rockstar titles that players have access to for as long as their membership remains active. The current roster of freebies includes Bully, Red Dead Redemption, GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, GTA: Liberty City Stories, GTA: Chinatown Wars, and LA Noire.</p><h2 id="How_Much_Is_GTA__"><strong>How Much Is GTA+?</strong></h2><p>GTA+ launched in 2022 priced at $6/month, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">the price went up to $8/month in 2024.</a> Memberships can be canceled at any time. There is no multi-month or annual subscription option.</p><h2 id="How_To_Sign_Up_For_GTA_"><strong>How To Sign Up For GTA+</strong></h2><p>GTA+ requires a copy of GTA V or GTA Online. You can sign up on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through those platforms' store pages or from within GTA Online. On PC, people can sign up via their preferred store or in game.</p><h2 id="GTA_6_"><b>GTA 6?</b></h2><p>Rockstar Games has not said anything yet about if GTA+ will be supported with GTA 6. Given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA 5's GTA Online may stick around even after GTA 6 launches</a>, it's possible GTA+ will continue to be supported for that game at least. It's expected that GTA 6 will have a significant online mode given the huge success of GTA Online, but it remains to be seen what form it may take. Rockstar has not uttered a word about GTA 6 since December 2023.</p><h2 id="Take_Two__Thrilled__With_GTA_"><strong>Take-Two "Thrilled" With GTA+</strong></h2><p>In 2022, Rockstar owner Take-Two commented on GTA+'s introduction, saying the company was "thrilled" with the response out of the gate.</p><p>"We're thrilled about how it's been rolled out so far. We're thrilled with the conversion rate," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-is-off-to-a-great-start-take-two-says/1100-6503526/" data-ref-id="1100-6503526">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said back then</a>. "And it's clear, that consumers really like the opportunity to engage with GTA Online and they value... what we're offering through a subscription."</p><p>Take-Two hasn't said a whole lot about GTA+ in the ensuing years, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-money-taketwo-makes-from-microtrans/1100-6477537/" data-ref-id="1100-6477537">the company loves the kind of recurring revenue that a subscription service provides. </a></p>
