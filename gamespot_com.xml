                <p>According to PlayStation veteran Chris Deering, Sony was anxious about the original Xbox and that concern prompted the company to sign an exclusivity deal with Take-Two for Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>"We were worried when we saw Xbox coming," Deering recalled at a recent EGX event in London, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields."</p><p>With that concern in mind, Deering said he approached third-party publishers and developers to ask if they would be interested in taking a "special deal" for timed exclusivity for any of their upcoming games. Deering and company didn't realize GTA would become such a massive franchise, but that bet seemed to pay off, as GTA III took the series into a new direction with a 3D open-world approach.</p><p>"One of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto III was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game," Deering said. "It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><p>The original Xbox would go on to launch in November 2001, but GTA III did not show up on Xbox until November 2003. The timed-exclusivity deals extended Vice City and San Andreas.</p><p>While the exclusivity deals ended there--GTA 4 and GTA 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time--Sony did continue to work with Rockstar on special deals. For example, GTA 5 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-grand-theft-auto-v-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/1100-6420294/" data-ref-id="1100-6420294">announced for PS4 at Sony's E3 briefing in 2014</a>. There is no word on if Rockstar has any special relationship with Sony or Microsoft for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, however.</p><p>As for Deering, he left Sony in 2005. He also made headlines recently when he said recent video game industry layoffs were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. Deering was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p>

                <p>The newest Call of Duty weapons have been revealed online, and we are running out of ways to describe how ridiculous and over-the-top the game's guns have become. As announced previously, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are getting numerous new weapons in Season 1 Reloaded, and these include a gun that turns into a bong and a melee weapon that morphs into a rave with a cat as the DJ. Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The "Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft," meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ. Check out the videos below to see these in action, and expect these store bundles to come to Black Ops 6 and Warzone soon.</p><p>These videos emerged from data-miners. When a new Call of Duty season launches, like Season 1 Reloaded did on December 5, people quickly dig through the files to find what's coming next, and that includes these two wacky bundles.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded brings a lot more to Call of Duty than bongs and raves. The update introduces new maps, modes, weapons, events, and all manner of holiday season changes.</p><p>For more on what's coming to Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 1 Reloaded this December, check out the gallery below.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-4/">Fallout 4</a> arrived nearly a decade ago, and it's anyone's guess when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> will be released. Thankfully, the fan developers  at Team Folon took it upon themselves to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/" data-ref-id="1100-6525518">Fallout London</a>, an unofficial Fallout 4 mod that gives players a glimpse of the post-apocalypse in the United Kingdom. Now, Team Folon plans to go even further with an upcoming DLC release for Fallout London.</p><p>"What started as a simple hotfix has grown into something much bigger," said the team on the Fallout London Discord. "Given the scope of this update, we're aware it may make changes that impact save files, so rather than risking breaking things for a small update, we're looking to roll this into a part of our very first DLC!"</p><p>Specific details about the release date and what will be in the DLC weren't disclosed, but it was said to include new content as well as things that were cut from the original release of the mod. Additionally, Team Folon announced that it's no longer just a collective of fans, and the company is now incorporated as an official business. The team suggested that it may work on "a small indie game," but promised to "always continue to support Fallout London."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-london-just-set-a-record-on-gog/1100-6525741/" data-ref-id="1100-6525741">Fallout London was downloaded 500,000 times</a> in the first 24 hours, which is a record for the GOG store. <a href="https://fallout4london.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fallout London still has its own page</a> outside of Discord, where more information about the mod can be found. Meanwhile, a separate team is working on another ambitious and unofficial Fallout 4 mod. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-nuevos-mexico-mod-trailer-brings-the-post-apocalypse-south-of-the-border/1100-6526953/" data-ref-id="1100-6526953">Fallout: Nuevos Mexico</a> doesn't currently have a release window, but it will explore what's happening in Mexico during the events of the Fallout games.</p>
