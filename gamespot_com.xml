                <p>Think you've got what it takes to climb the ranks of the Battlefield 6 Redsec competitive scene? EA has announced a new tournament circuit for the battle royale mode, titled the Battlefield Redsec Elite Series, featuring more than $1 million in prize money.</p><p>The Elite Series launches December 10 and will include 600 competitors, ranging from established pros to emerging talent looking to break into the shifting esports ecosystem. Fifty squads, handpicked by team captains who were invited by EA, from each of the three featured regions--the Americas, EMEA, and APAC--will compete across six Redsec battle royale matches online. The top eight squads will advance to a knockout-style elimination segment played within Redsec's Gauntlet mode, with the full format playing out over three days.</p>

<p>EA also announced an Open Series for anyone who wants to enter, beginning December 12. Successful squads in the Open Series will earn a chance to compete in the Elite Series alongside professional players. Registration is available through Repeat.gg. More details for both competitions are available on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's official site.</a></p><p>Battle royale esports continue to push forward across major titles like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and PUBG, though the ecosystem has shifted over the years as publishers adjust formats, rules, and prize pools. EA is most certainly announcing this series to bring more excitement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-update-makes-a-key-change-to-scoring/1100-6536376/" data-ref-id="1100-6536376">Battlefield 6</a> after it brought in millions of players following its October release.</p>

                <p>Gearbox's new content update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is getting into the holiday spirit by releasing Bounty Pack 1 for free. The first Bounty Pack, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, is now available on consoles and PC. As the title implies, this is Borderlands' version of a Christmas story as filtered through the lens of the game.</p><p>The DLC allows players to team up with the leader of the Outbounders, Rush, for some holiday cheer by giving "the miserly Minister Screw" a proverbial kick in the butt. The DLC comes alongside new gear and cosmetics, as well as some fresh missions. Gearbox also explained why this update was released for free.</p><p>"As a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, it was important that players receive it by the end of the year," wrote a Gearbox rep. "However, with the continued efforts to improve the Borderlands 4 experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036"></a><figcaption>Promo art for How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg"></figure><p>The remaining Bounty Packs are still bundled together as paid DLC, although they are also included in the game's Deluxe Edition, Super Deluxe Edition, and Bounty Pack Bundle owners. Gearbox is also adding a fifth Bounty Pack to the bundle, but details about what's coming with the future Bounty Packs haven't been released. Everyone who purchased the Bounty Pack Bundle or the previously listed editions of the game will receive the fifth Bounty Pack at no additional cost.</p><p>In the middle of December, Gearbox will add another free update that drops Bloomreaper the Invincible into an arena for a face-off against players in the first of series of "invincible boss" fights that are meant to challenge the players. Each boss chosen for the invincible boss fight will get a boost in health, lethal attack damage, and a new set of modifiers that make them even deadlier than before. Players who emerge victorious can earn new Legendaries.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will receive a new story pack in Q1 2026 called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, which will introduce a new Vault Hunter named C4SH. Gearbox will also debut a free update that adds Takedown mode to the game in 2026.</p><p>During a recent investment call hosted by Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, it was disclosed that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/" data-ref-id="1100-6536020">didn't live up to sales expectations</a> even though it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">the biggest launch in franchise history</a> and a debut as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">one of 2025's best-selling games</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch has released its first post-launch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant," Scronce says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8JKDfXT1pg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8JKDfXT1pg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The developer is also aware of the community debate around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/">Black Ops 7's aim assist</a>, which features reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. "We have been closely monitoring that conversation and looking at our internal data," Scronce says. The developer also reveals the studio is "fairly happy" with where the game's aim-assist is at, but there will be a slight increase to aim-assist strength at range. This change will arrive sometime ahead of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch's planned update includes spawn adjustments for Hardpoint, Free-For-All, and Team Deathmatch modes. A nerf is also coming for the game's overpowered Drone Pod field upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer announced that Endgame mode, which players can unlock after completing the campaign, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">available to everyone</a> starting on November 21. Players who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a variety of rewards, including XP tokens, GobbleGums, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies changes, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discusses the difficulty level of the boss fight for Ashes of the Damned. The developer says it was designed to be challenging, but it is more difficult than intended. Adjustments will be made to the barnacle spawns needed to help Ol' Tessie, so players can spend less time repairing the Wonder Vehicle and more time driving. The developer says it's slowing down the speed boss's missile barrage attack.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/">Nuketown arrived to Black Ops 7 today</a>, and this is a new 2025 variant of Treyarch's classic map. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional maps, and more.</p>

                <p>You'll need to take a trip to the Spaceport map to complete the A Lay of the Land quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. This quest tasks you with finding multiple items in a single trip to the map, so you'll want to come prepared to make a long trek and survive for quite some time. Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.</p><p>Knowing that you'll have a lot of traveling and surviving to do on Spaceport for the A Lay of the Land quest, we'd recommend you bring guns you're comfortable with, as well as plenty of healing items. Additionally, it's a great idea to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with a specific item to complete the quest back in Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to head out and begin A Lay of the Land, follow the guide below.</p><h2>Where to find the shipping notes in the foreman's office</h2><p>The first objective requires you to collect some shipping notes in the foreman's office at the Jiangsu Warehouse. This POI is located on the northwestern side of the Spaceport map. It's not usually a very busy spot, but keep your eyes open for nearby raiders nonetheless.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895" data-ratio="0.56039807824296" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895"></a><figcaption>Jiangsu Warehouse location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg"></figure><p>Once inside, you'll notice there's really not much to this warehouse. Simply head upstairs into the office to locate the shipping notes on a desk in plain sight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606897" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606897"></a><figcaption>Look for the shipping notes on a desk upstairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606897-share_20251118_1025580.jpeg"></figure><p>With that out of the way, you'll have a slightly more dangerous location to head to next, so get prepared and set off when you're ready.</p><h2>Locate the scanners on the upper floor of Control Tower A6</h2><p>The second objective requires you to seek out a LiDAR Scanner on the upper floor of Control Tower A6, which is located in the middle of the Spaceport map. This area is among the most contested locations on the map, meaning you'll want to approach it with the mindset that a fight could break out at any moment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606886" data-ratio="0.56047092400999" data-width="2803" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606886"></a><figcaption>Control Tower A6 location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606886-share_20251118_1025591.jpeg"></figure><p>There are a few ways to enter the first room of the Control Tower A6, but for the sake of this guide, we need to enter from the front left side.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606887" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606887"></a><figcaption>Enter Control Tower A6 here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606887-share_20251118_1026013.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you enter the Control Tower A6 building, walk to the door straight ahead. Be mindful that there is sometimes a turret in here, so take it out if necessary. Open the door, then take the stairs all the way up to the next floor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606889-share_20251118_1026210.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606889-share_20251118_1026210.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606889"></a><figcaption>Enter this door.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606889-share_20251118_1026210.jpeg"></figure><p>When entering the next floor, take an immediate right.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606890-share_20251118_1026221.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606890" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606890-share_20251118_1026221.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606890"></a><figcaption>Head right when you reach the next floor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606890-share_20251118_1026221.jpeg"></figure><p>Take another right to wrap around to a cubicle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606891-share_20251118_1026232.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606891" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606891-share_20251118_1026232.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606891"></a><figcaption>Let's take one more right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606891-share_20251118_1026232.jpeg"></figure><p>Here, you'll find the LiDAR Scanner. Interact with the objective to cause the scanner to fall out, then be sure to pick it up and add it to your inventory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606894-share_20251118_1052260.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606894-share_20251118_1052260.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606894"></a><figcaption>Interact with this box to get the LiDAR Scanner.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606894-share_20251118_1052260.jpeg"></figure><p>Lastly, you'll need to extract with the LiDAR Scanner and return it to Shani in Speranza to complete the quest. As such, you'll want to head to whichever extraction point is closest to your location and play things cautiously until you can get out. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure the LiDAR Scanner is placed in it in case you don't make it out. It's not that we don't believe in you; we're just looking out for you, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>
