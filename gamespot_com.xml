                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide/" data-ref-id="5000-516156">Warhammer 40K: Darktide's</a> latest update will continue to flesh out developer Fatshark's Left 4 Dead-like, expanding the game's Mortis Trials mode while also adding a new enemy type, additional weapons, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">The free Bound by Duty update will go live September 23 for all platforms, and brings some significant additions. As detailed in a Fatshark <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the bulk of the new content is for Mortis Trials, Darktide's wave-based roguelike mode. There will be a new arena, the Theatre of Rectitude, where players can test their mettle, as well as new Indulgence archetypes that will offer new combat styles for players to experiment with. Additional Memory Echoes added to the mode will expand on NPC backstories to reveal more about the game's cast of characters and the history of the ship that serves as the game's hub, the Mourningstar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpOvbThhZe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpOvbThhZe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the Mortis Trial additions make up a large chunk of the update, there's plenty new for players who prefer the game's mission-based gameplay. A new weapon for the Veteran, the Power Falchion, will work similarly to the Zealot's Relic Blade, allowing players to empower the weapon until it overheats. There will also be new Mark variants of the Bolt Pistol and Boltgun, both of which emphasize explosive damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Those new weapons will be put to the test against a new enemy type, the Scab Plasma Gunner. Wielding a powerful Plasma weapon that deals high damage, players will want to focus on these enemies whenever possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatshark completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-darktide-getting-revamped-class-system-with-skill-trees-and-new-abilities/1100-6517003/" data-ref-id="1100-6517003">revamped Darktide's classes in 2023</a>, adding greatly expanded talent trees and new abilities for each of the game's four (now five with the addition of the DLC Arbites) classes. In Bound by Duty, Fatshark takes another swing at balancing the talent trees. The Veteran, Zealot, and Psyker trees have been reworked to be more open and allow for "more flexibility and player agency," according to Fatshark, while the Ogryn and Arbites talents have also seen a "light touch-up."</p><p dir="ltr">Rounding out the update is the addition of a dodge counter that informs players of how many dodge charges they have remaining, as well as a new event called Smuggled Munitions that will see players taking on squads of the game's new Plasma Gun enemies while in low visibility conditions. For those looking to snag some free cosmetics, Twitch Drops for Darktide will be live from September 23 through October 13.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-is-getting-a-new-long-awaited-class-next-year/1100-6534355/" data-ref-id="1100-6534355">Space Marine 2 will receive a long-awaited class next year</a> in a free update.

The studio will host a Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it's aiming to stress-test its servers before the game officially launches later this month.</p><p>This open weekend will allow players to explore the Dam Battlegrounds and experience "elements of progression and crafting" while completing a set of quests, Embark Studios said. One thing to note here is that progress will not carry over from the Slam Test, but participating players will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for the full game.</p><p>This will be open to everyone aged 16 and older, so you won't need a download key or an invite to get an early taste of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/news/">Arc Raiders</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572048"></a><figcaption>The exclusive backpack that can be unlocked by participating in the stress test.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this year, it looked like there'd be a showdown between extraction shooters as Arc Raiders was scheduled to launch in close proximity to Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/">Marathon</a>.

                <p>This past weekend saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new battle royale mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chaotic-delulu-mode-what-you-need-to-know-about-proximity-chat-battle-royale/1100-6534895/" data-ref-id="1100-6534895">Delulu</a>. A take on Fortnite's familiar formula, the catch here is that you can talk to anyone--whether squaded up or not--thanks to the new proximity chat. While this adds a nice layer of sociality to the game, it's also resulted in an increase in discrimination and harassment, which led to developer Epic Games banning "thousands" of accounts before the weekend closed out.</p><p>Delulu is exactly what you think it would be if you're familiar with both Fortnite and internet slang. Cutesy shorthand for "delusional," this new mode sees you potentially team up with--and likely betray, as there can only be one winner--anyone you see thanks to proximity chat. As you near another player, you can form a sort of temporary group chat to strategize as you play. This seems like it could be a fabulous idea, particularly for players who tend to play solo but still want to coordinate.</p>
