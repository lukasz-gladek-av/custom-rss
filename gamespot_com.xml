                <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is switching from the co-CEO system--currently occupied by Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst--to just one person in charge. Nishino has been promoted to sole CEO of SIE and will step into this role starting April 1, 2025. Hulst will continue to serve as CEO of the Studio Business Group, reporting directly to Nishino.</p><p>"It has been a pleasure working more closely with Hermen and Nishino and gaining insight into the ever-changing, fast-paced world of Sony Interactive Entertainment," CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment-302362728.html" rel="nofollow ">press statement</a>. "As we hand the baton to Nishino and this exceptional leadership team, I am confident that SIE will reach new heights in the days ahead."</p><p>Nishino and Hulst originally stepped into their co-CEO roles in 2024, taking over from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-2024/1100-6518034/" data-ref-id="1100-6518034">outgoing CEO Jim Ryan</a>. In a statement, Nishino said that Sony plans to grow the PlayStation community in new ways such as IP expansion and technology innovation.</p><p>2024 was a mixed year for Sony, as it saw Helldivers 2 emerge as a sleeper hit while Concord was a massive flop. That has led to some big changes behind the scenes, as Sony's ambitious plans to launch 12 live-service games by 2025 were overhauled. This number was cut in half, resulting in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/">cancellation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">God of War live-service spin-off was also reportedly been canceled</a>.</p><p>2025 does have a more positive outlook for Sony, as big games like GTA 6, Assassin's Creed Shadows, and Ghost of Yokei are scheduled to arrive this year. At the same time, Sony is also expanding into forms of media as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-are-officially-in-development/1100-6528663/">Horizon and Helldivers live-action adaptations</a> are on the way.</p>

                <p>Microsoft was the number-one video game publisher in December 2024, despite struggling to sell Xbox hardware. Its success here is attributed to Call of Duty, according to global data.</p><p>According to data firm Ampere (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-was-the-no-1-games-publisher-in-the-world-last-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Call of Duty HQ--which comprises Black Ops 6, Warzone, and other COD games--drew in 38 monthly users in November 2024, and 64% of consumer spending on Microsoft titles in December was through PlayStation, mostly on Call of Duty. Microsoft's position as the top publisher in 2024 also included sales of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was released in December.</p><p>Ampere also noted that Electronic Arts generated $366 million over the same period, putting it second to Microsoft. EA Sports FC 25 was the biggest driver for EA's success, although it still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">underperformed according to EA's internal expectations</a>. Chinese publishers like NetEase and Tencent pulled in impressive numbers as well. Ampere estimated that Marvel Rivals brought in 29 million monthly active users and Path of Exile 2 generated $148 million.</p><p>The multiplatform strategy Microsoft has been pursuing is seemingly driving results. However, Xbox is still struggling behind PlayStation in hardware sales. According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">recent data in the US,</a> PS5 sales are pacing ahead of PS4 while Xbox Series X|S is behind of Xbox One at the same point in both of their respective lifecycles. However, all three major platform holders experienced declining hardware sales in the US.</p><p>Xbox's Phil Spencer has reaffirmed that Microsoft is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028">committed to the hardware space</a> while trying to push more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/" data-ref-id="1100-6529067">multiplatform releases</a>. As seen in the Xbox Developer Direct, games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will come to rival platforms. Microsoft is also reportedly going to support the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-xbox-games-are-coming-to-switch-2/1100-6529052/" data-ref-id="1100-6529052">Nintendo Switch 2 when it releases</a>.</p><p>Microsoft also operates gigantic mobile games like Candy Crush and subscription games like World of Warcraft, but those were apparently not included in the Ampere report. While Ampere's data is unofficial, Microsoft reports earnings today, January 29, so we'll have a clearer picture of how Xbox performed last year.</p>
