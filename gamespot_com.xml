                <p>It has been a <em>wild </em>week for video games, and between the headline-grabbing news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">shadow-dropped games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">turbulent console preorders</a>, it's only natural that some stuff has flown under the radar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starless-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-647018">Starless Abyss</a> is one such example here, as this blend of roguelike deckbuilding and Eldritch horror has just released today with very little fanfare.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2nSUIMk0Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mx2nSUIMk0Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a shame, because so far, the game is earning high praise for its Lovecraftian themes and retro-inspired art design. Starless Abyss sees you command a fleet of spaceships powered by science <em>and</em> the occult against alien invaders from a nightmarish reality. As one of five Proximae tasked with saving humanity, you'll be able to upgrade your ships along the way, and battles take place on a hex-based grid.</p><p>The catch here is that the closer you bring your fleet to the Outer Gods, the faster your sanity will deplete. You can keep your mind in check, but embracing a little bit of mental chaos will also allow you to use powerful occult abilities in battle. The art direction also looks quite enticing with its old-school spaceship designs and space-terror monsters. It's Steam Deck Verified as well, so you can download it and start playing right away without the need to fiddle about with the game settings.</p><p>If you're curious, you can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full game on PC via Steam</a>, and a demo is available.</p><p>Looking ahead, a bunch of other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-bunch-of-cool-new-games-were-revealed-amid-this-weeks-wildness/2900-6498/">cool new games were announced earlier this week by Top Hat Studios and The Mix</a>. These cover a wide variety of genre, ranging from wholesome platforming with a duck through to survival-horror where you have to fend off flesh-monsters inside of a PS2-era mansion, and they're all coming out in the near future on PC and console.</p>
