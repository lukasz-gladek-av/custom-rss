                <p>When it comes to building a winning team in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the right formation is just as important as the players you pick. A good formation can unlock your team’s true potential, while the wrong one can leave you exposed at every turn. But whether you’re someone who favors the gegenpress over tiki-taka, there’s a formation for you.</p><p>This guide will explain the <strong>best FC 26 formations</strong>, breaking down their strengths and weaknesses, while explaining what type of players you’ll need to make it work. From tried and tested setups like 4-2-3-1 Wide to more experimental systems like 3-5-2, we’ll help you find the perfect shape to dominate in your next Division Rivals or Career Mode game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_1_2_1_2_Narrow">4-1-2-1-2 Narrow</h2><p dir="ltr">The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow meta is back, and we couldn’t be more delighted. This diamond formation wasn’t really favoured in the FC 25 meta, but it’s having a bit of a resurgence.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s designed for players who want to dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, using quick passing and deep runs to open up their opponent’s defensive line. Your CDM acts as an anchor to help control the play with two box-to-box central midfielders, while a creative CAM acts as a Shadow Striker.</p><p dir="ltr">Two strikers up front are able to play off one another or hold up the ball for midfield reinforcements. As the name suggests, the formation is tight, so if the ball is overturned, the CDM should be sitting in the passing lanes waiting for the right ball to intercept.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation really only works if you have good fullbacks and a talented CDM for cover. Since the shape is quite predictable, it can be easy for an attacking squad to carve the backline open because of the space left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we set up our squad:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: AxZKwE4#K8S</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Counter</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Sweeper Keeper, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Box-to-Box, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Poacher, Attack / Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_2_3_1_Wide">4-2-3-1 Wide</h2><p dir="ltr">If you used 4-2-3-1 last year, this will feel rather familiar. With four defenders, two CDMs, and one CAM, this is arguably one of the most balanced formations you can use.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation offers you control in transitional play, while giving you lots of attacking options up front. The CAM - acting as a Shadow Striker -is the creative link between the lone striker and the wingers, who should cut inside to receive passes. In defense, two CDMs support the four-strong defensive line, helping to cover the passing lanes to break up play.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve set this up so that the CDMs are involved in build up play, but we’d recommend having a striker who can adequately fulfil an Advanced Forward role. We’ve also locked our fullbacks into a defensive set up, but if you want to stretch the play more, you can switch them to a balanced view.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’ve set it up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: GZewNW4MwiDo</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Ball-Playing Keeper, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender/Ball-Playing Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (L): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (R): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_4_2_Holding">4-4-2 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This is one of the most popular formations in the game - and one that’s perfect if you’re just starting out. This is because your defense, midfield, and attackers are all perfectly balanced on the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">With four players in defense and midfield, it offers a strong defensive structure while offering you options in attack with two strikers. The wide midfielders and fullbacks can stretch the attack on the counter to create chances.</p><p dir="ltr">This balanced spread makes it difficult for opponents to find gaps to attack. However, with only two central players in midfield, you can find yourself overrun when coming up against teams that overload the middle of the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">To help counter this, we’ve opted to use the Holding version of the formation to reinforce the defense in light of FC 26’s reduced AI defending gameplay. This gives us two CDMs, rather than two central midfielders.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our tactics in full:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: SBs8ciEacQ%U</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_3_3_Holding">4-3-3 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This formation is one of the most versatile attacking formations in the game, giving you plenty of width, decent midfield control, and clear attacking options. With three forwards you can stretch pretty much any defense with quick passing through both wide options and central midfield.</p><p dir="ltr">4-3-3 formations work really well for players who like to counter quickly and directly using plenty of width. If you want to slow it down, your midfield options can dictate the tempo with the fullbacks dropping in to create more space. The only problem is that this shape can be overrun by the formations above. If your midfielders are caught out of possession high up the pitch, you may struggle to win the ball back.</p><p dir="ltr">To counter this, we’ve set up our squad so we have a holding CDM, flanked by a deep-lying playmaker and a playmaker in central midfield. Our wingers will provide width in attack, with one wingback available on support duties.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re going to opt for this formation, you’re going to need strong, fast wingers who have decent shooting and passing stats. You’re also going to need a talented striker who can finish consistently from anywhere in the box.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’d set this up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: EBdk%umK%GAm</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">RB: Wingback, Support</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Holding, Ball-Winning</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build-Up / Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">LW: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Wide Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_are_these_the_best_FC_26_formations_">Why are these the best FC 26 formations?</h2><p dir="ltr">With 29 different formations available in the game, you might be wondering why we’ve selected just four above. The simple answer is that they best fit the current meta, where compact shapes and quick passing dominate. The AI defending changes this year mean you have to rely on tight shape, passing lanes, and quick transitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the formations we’ve highlighted offer a strong defensive base, clear attacking patterns, and an adaptability that will help you gain the upper hand in competitive matches. The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow gives you central overloads and passing triangles, 4-2-3-1 Wide balances structure with creativity, 4-4-2 Holding gives you a balanced foundation to build from, and 4-3-3 stretches defense with pace and width.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the best FC 26 formations will change with future updates, but for now these are the tactics we’d use to gain the upper hand in Division Rivals, Ultimate Team, and Career Mode.</p>

                <p>Starbreeze has canceled its upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, which was in the works under the working title Project Baxter. The developer said its board of directors and management opted to cancel the project after a "strategic review" found that resources would be better deployed on its successful Payday franchise instead.</p><p>Starbreeze is taking an impairment charge of about SEK 255 million ($27.2 million) as a result of Project Baxter's cancellation.</p><p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," Starbreeze CEO Adolf Kristjansson said. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><h2><strong>Layoffs</strong></h2><p>Some developers who were working on Project Baxter are now shifting to other teams at Starbreeze, including the Payday unit. Others are being let go. "Where internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry," the company said, adding that about 44 developers, including full-time employees and contractors, are losing their jobs as part of this move.</p><p>Kristjansson went on to say that Starbreeze is "doubling down" on the heisting genre, including Payday and "the future expansion of the genre."</p><p>The cancellation of Project Baxter, layoffs, and further focus on Payday and the heist genre overall, will help Starbreeze become "cash-flow positive in 2026," the company said.</p><p>"I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support," Kristjansson said. "Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed."</p><h2><strong>What's next for Starbreeze</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze also outlined some of what's to come in the future, including the aforementioned doubling down on Payday. The latest entry in the series, Payday 3, is nowhere near as successful as Payday 2, at least on Steam and in terms of concurrent players. However, Starbreeze said today that it continues to deploy updates and improvements to Payday 3 to help t become a "scalable live-engagement platform to engage millions of players worldwide."</p><p>"The franchise will evolve into a modern live-engagement game through ongoing technology upgrades, expansion and refinement of the player experience, and enhanced engagement models designed to be both fair and sustainable," Starbreeze said.</p><p>For Payday 3, Starbreeze said the team working on the game will grow to about 50 people before the end of 2025 and will scale from there in line with player engagement, if it comes.</p><p>Payday 2 continues to get new updates and improvements as well, and the game recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-launches-a-subscription-service-that-gets-you-lots-of-dlc-for-5-month/1100-6534993/" data-ref-id="1100-6534993">added a subscription offering to get all the DLC for a monthly charge. </a></p><h2><strong>"New games and experiences" are coming</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze said the Payday franchise has reached more than 50 million people to date and has generated almost SEK 4 billion ($427.3 million) in lifetime gross revenue.</p><p>Given the immense success of Payday, Starbreeze said today that it is working on "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre beyond Starbreeze's core projects." These will include spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and "franchise expansion" to new platforms. Finally, Starbreeze said in its memo to investors that Starbreeze will continue to take on work-for-hire jobs to help supplement the company's revenue.</p><p>"This strategy is about execution and growth--with greater quality and predictability," Kristjansso said. "Our goal is to keep Payday evolving as a modern live-engagement game, and to open new ways for players to experience the heisting genre through heisting experiences and special operations. By focusing on delivering lasting value to players, we strengthen the foundation that drives sustainable growth for Starbreeze."</p>

Scroll down to the codes section at the bottom of the options, then enter the code in the box and click/tap the Claim button to get the item. You’ll get an error message if the code is invalid or has expired.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are plenty of other Roblox experiences with codes you can use.

                <p>Microsoft opened <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/" data-ref-id="1100-6535007">preorders for the ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and ROG Xbox Ally on September 25, and they quickly sold out at some retailers. The high-end handheld is still two weeks away from launch, but at least one fan in Europe got it early thanks to a mistake by Amazon France.</p><p>The fan in question goes by TechnicalFun77 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1num2ad/quick_review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/09/30/amazon-france-ships-xbox-ally-x-units-over-two-weeks-early-user-impressions-posted-on-reddit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>), and the user largely had positive things to say about it before deleting their account for some unexplained reason.</p><p>"It's a good console," wrote TechnicalFun77. "Very good ergonomics, controlled weight, pretty nice handheld, armory crate in the full screen experience is very responsive, no latency problem when pressing buttons, quite fluid in the menus in general, and superb battery life at 17-25w. And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device. It [feels] like the sounds are going all around my head, I almost don't need headphones."</p><p>In a follow-up response, the user noted that "the joysticks of the ROG Xbox Ally are almost identical to the Xbox One," and that its sleep/resume function was an improvement over Windows, "but not as good as on Steam Deck. It's quite inconsistent."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> actors Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-stars-sell-you-on-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds/1100-6535054/" data-ref-id="1100-6535054">appeared in an online ad</a> for the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is the higher-end model of the two handhelds. ROG Xbox Ally X will retail for $1,000 in the US, while ROG Xbox Ally will be going for $600. Preorders are still open at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM6C3ZMN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/13ndhl8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/nxc8on9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/dxp2z5x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>. The release date is October 16.</p><p>On Friday, October 3, Microsoft will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">raise its Xbox console prices</a> in the US. The Xbox Series S will now cost $400 (up from $380), while the Xbox Series X 1TB will be $650 (up from $600).</p>
