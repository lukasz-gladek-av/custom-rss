<section><p>Comfort, function, and convenience come together to produce a phenomenal option for Xbox and PC players if you don't mind the wire</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In order to be successful, a controller needs three things: comfort, function, and convenience. There's a reason why the Duke--the notoriously large controller that accompanied the original Xbox in 2001--was eventually replaced with a smaller design, durable as it was. The Duke was heavy and huge, with buttons spread out a little too far across the interface.</p><p dir="ltr">Scuf's newest controller, the Valor Pro Wired Controller for Xbox and PC, nails all three of these elements. Its light weight and smooth front faceplate makes it easy to carry and hold without irritation. The design of the bumpers and triggers on the top of the controller make it very simple to alternate between, while the four rear paddles offer extra control in tight situations. A few other additional features--like built-in audio controls--add additional convenience. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the Valor Pro is a great choice for Xbox and PC players alike, provided you can live with a wire attached to whatever you're playing on.</p><p dir="ltr">Right out of the box, the Valor Pro felt great in my hands, which are larger than most. The placement of the buttons and sticks seem to slot right into the positions my hands want them to be. It's surprisingly light in the hands too, to the point where it feels like a toy rather than a pro controller. That's not to say it feels cheap, though, as the sticks, buttons, and d-pad feel strong to the touch. The smooth faceplate creates a tight grip, and the nonslip grips work as advertised, no matter how sweaty the palms get--and I, a person with pretty sweaty hands, would know.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks on the Valor Pro are especially comfortable thanks to a ridged fabric-like border on the outside rim. There's no hard edge to irritate the thumb; instead, that fabric serves as a nice cushion when I'm blasting people in Fortnite or Call of Duty. The sticks should last a while too, as the Valor Pro contains Hall Effect anti-drift measures to keep them precise longer. There was no drift to speak of during this review--which, if there were, would be a huge issue for a brand-new controller--and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. Meanwhile, the d-pad's contoured shape fits the thumb nicely, and where other controller d-pads sometimes feel flimsy, this one has some weight to it with every touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The four back paddles on the controller are the most impressive thing on it, as each one avoids a common pitfall I've experienced with back buttons for some time: They resist accidental button presses. I've routinely pressed a button on the back of a controller at inopportune times, usually in quiet moments where stealth is key, and it immediately turns my strategy into mush. These paddles feel more like front face buttons than any I've used before, and that feeling has resulted in zero accidental activations during this review period.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valor Pro also offers controller profiles, where you can alternate between three different button designations for the back buttons. One is specific for shooters, and puts the change-weapon and reload buttons in the back; another is for sports games and assigns the A and B buttons back there, which helps with, for example, easy shooting and passing in NBA 2K. The third profile is for racing games, turning each back button into a different direction, and while I wasn't quite as enamored with that profile, the experience wasn't so bad that it killed the convenience of the other two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If none of those profiles fit for you, the Valor Pro’s custom remapping feature lets you set each profile to the buttons you use the most in the games you play the most. Remapping is simple; each profile is set to a different color, and if you hold in the profile button on the back until the colored LED blinks, you can then assign paddles to buttons however you like. Controller customization is increasingly becoming the standard, and the Valor Pro's version gets the job done.</p><p dir="ltr">If you plug a headset into your Valor Pro, you’ll have extra control over the audio thanks to the controller’s built-in volume knobs. The left knob on the bottom of the controller handles in-game audio, while the knob to its right focuses on chat volume, and both can be pressed down to mute the corresponding audio. Having these controls onboard the controller is super convenient, not to mention the knobs are, like the rest of the buttons on the Valor Pro, placed in a comfortable spot for your fingers to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its execution, the Valor Pro doesn't provide much in the way of <em>new</em> features. At $99, it sits in the "budget pro" controller tier with options like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> and Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot--or, at about two-thirds the price, the 8BitDo Ultimate. Those offer similar features to what the Valor Pro is doing here. Still, Scuf has done a great job designing this controller to feel like the top of the line rather than the less expensive option.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the matter of that pesky wire. Wired controllers are fine if your gaming setup allows for it, but wireless controllers are also popular for a reason--and something like the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Razer Wolverine V3 Pro or Xbox Elite 2 offers those options on a wireless controller for a similar price. It's true that latency is reduced with a wired controller, and Scuf's focus on precision calls for a low-latency solution, which something like a wire provides.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, people with close-quarters gaming setups won't be worried about this, but if your Xbox is across the room from your couch, the Valor Pro being shackled to the system likely won't work for you--even with the 10-foot USB-C cord included with the controller; a wireless controller works better than a potential tripping hazard.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I am very pleased with the Scuf Valor Pro. It's one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever used, with buttons placed so naturally that it's as if the controller was made for my hands specifically. The back paddles are fully customizable and resistant to frantic accidental pushes, the smooth grip keeps the controller in my hand no matter how wild a gameplay session gets, and the built-in audio controls give me easy access to both game sound and chat audio. A wireless version would have been great, but even with the wire, the Scuf Valor Pro is a fantastic option for your next Xbox or PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Valor Pro Wired Controller is available now for $99 at select retailers and at scufgaming.com.</p>

                <p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">WWE 2K25</a> features a Showcase mode that will let fans relive the past by taking part in several legendary matches. Essentially an interactive documentary--and hosted by "The Wise Man" Paul Heyman this year--2K Showcase: The Bloodline Dynasty will also allow players to alter the outcomes of these matches.</p><p>The trip down wrestling memory lane features a selection of classic bouts, including Yokozuna's infamous battle against Hulk Hogan at the 1993 King of the Ring, the brutal No Holds Barred match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rikishi, and the Royal Rumble 2022 showdown between Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.</p><p>Each match fits into one of three categories--Relive History, Change History, and Create History--and in total, 15 of them have been revealed so far. Here's the full list:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz8zsUmIBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tnz8zsUmIBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>Relive History</h3><ul><li>Yokozuna (with Mr. Fuji) vs. Hulk Hogan -- King of the Ring 1993</li><li>Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley -- RAW February 13, 1997</li><li>Nia Jax vs. Lyra Valkyria -- Queen of the Ring 2024</li><li>The Usos vs. The New Day (with Big E) -- Hell in a Cell 2017</li><li>Solo Sikoa vs. Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) -- NXT September 13, 2022</li></ul><h3>Change History</h3><ul><li>The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) vs. The Steiner Brothers -- WrestleMania IX</li><li>Rikishi vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin -- No Mercy 2000</li><li>Umaga (with Armando Estrada) vs. John Cena -- New Year's Revolution 2007</li><li>Tamina vs. Natalya vs. Carmella vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch -- Money in the Bank 2017</li><li>Naomi vs. Bayley -- Super ShowDown 2020</li><li>Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins -- Royal Rumble 2022</li></ul><h3>Create History</h3><ul><li>High Chief Peter Miavia vs. George "The Animal" Steele</li><li>The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) vs. The Dudley Boyz</li><li>The OG Bloodline vs. New Bloodline in WarGames</li><li>The Islanders (Haku and Tama) vs. The Street Profits</li></ul><p>Showcase Mode is typically one of the biggest highlights of a WWE 2K game, but this year's version of the mode is a big departure from previous instances, as it focuses on the Anoa'i family instead of a single superstar. The last couple of years in WWE programming have seen Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and several other members of that extended wrestling dynasty rise to prominence, while other WWE legends like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the late Umaga, and the Wild Samoans have all been praised for their contributions to the sports entertainment industry.</p><p>Beyond the Showcase mode, you can also hop on a boat and head to The Island--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-shows-off-its-new-open-world-island-mode-for-the-first-time/1100-6529460/">a new social space</a> that looks like it was heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City--take part in custom exhibition matches, and chart your own rise to the top as part of the MyRise mode. WWE 2K25 will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4 on March 14, but if you purchase the Deadman Edition or The Bloodline Edition, you'll get into the game a week early on March 7.</p><p>"With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-like-cody-rhodes-explores-what-comes-after-you-finish-the-story/1100-6529209/">WWE 2K25 preview</a>. "There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Not only can you do it yourself in Design Home, but now the game will let you become your own DIY star for HGTV with a new collaboration. For starters, a Fixer to Fabulous crossover has already kicked off in the mobile title. Next up are weekly challenges based on House Hunters, one of the most popular shows on the network.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fixer to Fabulous crossover began February 19 in Design Home, with weekly challenges called Bentonville Beauty and Arkansas Amazement. The partnership will also be reciprocated. An upcoming episode of Fixer to Faborlous--set to air on March 25--will see hosts Dave and Jenny Marrs playing the mobile title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMhq6vyZKv0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WMhq6vyZKv0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There's no date yet for the House Hunters challenges; EA says they will be coming soon. The company also states Design Home has seen 131 million players worldwide, and the HGTV collaboration isn't the first partnership for the game. For example, almost a year ago, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/design-home/news/design-home-sims-freeplay-interior-design-series" rel="nofollow ">renovation game partnered up with Sims Freeplay</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Design Home launched in 2016 and wasn't originally under EA's umbrella. That changed, however, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-completes-acquisition-of-glu-mobile-in-2-1-billion-deal/1100-6490777/">the company acquired Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion</a> in 2021. Design Home is still free-to-play but features in-app purchases. EA touts that actual brands, such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, can be utilized to decorate interior rooms in the game.</p>

                <p>The recent announcement that NetEase was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laying off some of its US-based Marvel Rivals developers</a>, including one of the game's directors, prompted concern and questions given that the hero shooter is performing well in the market <a href="https://ir.netease.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2025/02/20/3-04-13/Q4%202024%20Earnings%20Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with 40 million players</a>. Now, a clearer picture of what's going on and the context behind the shocking decision is coming into focus.</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published a report</a> in which he offered his take. Ahmad said there is "some truth" to how various Chinese game companies are downsizing their US operations due in part to "geopolitical risks" under the new Trump administration. However, there may be more to the story. Ahmad said the "full picture is more nuanced" and might also reflect NetEase performing a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p><p>In addition to the layoffs at the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase is Seattle--under a dozen people were reportedly affected--NetEase made a number of other significant drawbacks to its global games business. Ahmad pointed out how NetEase either closed or scaled down funding for Ouka Studio in Japan, Worlds Untold in Canada, and Jar of Sparks in the US. More recently, Just Cause creator Christopher Sundberg's new studio Liquid Swords announced cuts, as did Halo Infinite co-developer SkyBox Labs in Canada. Both teams were funded in part by NetEase.</p><p>"NetEase aggressively expanded its overseas footprint between 2019 and 2023, opening and investing in numerous studios outside China with the aim to develop high-end PC and console games," Ahmad said. "NetEase's recent decisions regarding its overseas investments and studio operations reflect a broader recalibration of its global strategy, driven by multiple factors. This change in strategy has impacted both US based studios and non-US based studios."</p><p>Ahmad went on to note that the "core" development team for Marvel Rivals is based in Guangzhou, China. This includes a second game director, Guangyun Chen, alongside the US-based director, Thaddeus Sasser, who was let go this week.</p><p>Also in his note, Ahmad said NetEase and other Chinese giants like Tencent and miHoYo invested significantly in overseas games and teams to try to reach players globally. However, Ahmad said a "turning point" for Chinese companies came in 2024 when Black Myth: Wukong, developed by a relatively small Chinese team at Game Science, broke out and became a giant success.</p><p>"The success of Black Myth: Wukong challenged the industry's assumption that only Western or Japanese AAA studios could produce globally competitive PC and console titles," Ahmad said.</p><p>So why did NetEase cut its US-based Marvel Rivals development team? We may never know the real answer, but Ahmad said it has more to do with "high costs and lower returns" over the past few years following a pullback after the boom of the pandemic. "Therefore, streamlining operations helps reduce costs and shorten development cycles, and NetEase is now following a new strategy both for these reasons and to mitigate risk from US-China policy changes," he said.</p><p>It's not just NetEase that's scaling back operations in the US, as the US video game industry has undergone turbulent times of late, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">thousands of layoffs rocking the business in the past few years.</a> These cuts come as some US-based video game companies, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including Electronic Arts, continue to see huge profits.</a></p>

                <p>A recent report said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was at one point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-could-have-shuttered-xbox-prior-to-major-acquisitions-report/1100-6528826/" data-ref-id="1100-6528826">mulling the possibility of shuttering the Xbox division</a>. Before this, Microsoft's own co-founder Paul Allen's investment company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cofounder-s-investment-group-calls-for-xbox-spinoff/1100-6415919/" data-ref-id="1100-6415919">called for Microsoft to dump Xbox and spin it off as a separate business</a>. That never happened, and now Nadella is speaking up to express Microsoft's commitment to gaming. He told <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarkesh Patel</a> that it's not true that Microsoft's investments in gaming is part of some kind of "means to some other end."</p><p>Microsoft has a long history of supporting gaming, Nadella pointed out, referencing how Microsoft Flight Simulator was a Microsoft product before the company even made the first version of Windows.</p><p>"So, gaming has got a long history at the company, and we want to be in gaming for gaming's sake. I always start by saying I hate to be in businesses where they're means to some other end. They have to be ends unto themselves," he said.</p><p>Nadella's comments came in response to a question about if Nadella had some kind of "premonition" about how gaming could help contribute to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Microsoft's push into the artificial intelligence space by using games to train its models. </a></p><p>"We are a company where we have to bring all these assets together and be better owners by adding value. For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge. Ninja Theory has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Muse won't be use to make games</a>, but instead to help empower humans to work faster.</p><p>"I think about gaming data as perhaps, you know, what YouTube is perhaps to Google, gaming data is to Microsoft. And so therefore I'm excited about that," Nadella said.</p><p>AI is a controversial technology within the gaming space and across numerous other businesses. A recent GDC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">study</a> found that the majority of game studios worldwide use generative AI already, despite concerns about the technology. Microsoft itself has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">gone on record saying advancements to AI will lead to job losses</a> in the short term but may lead to more opportunities in the long term. Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 people in the past year in gaming roles, though whether or not the reduction had anything to do with AI is unknown. Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>
