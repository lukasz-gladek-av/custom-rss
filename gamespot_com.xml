                <p>LocalThunk has revealed that Balatro is now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, along with the fourth Friends of Jimbo pack. This pack includes collaborations with Fallout, Assassin's Creed, and more.</p><p>Friends of Jimbo packs are free updates that allow players to change the face cards of any or all suits in the deck. These have no impact on gameplay. In this most recent pack, the eight new crossovers are: Dead by Daylight, Civilization VII, Critical Role, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, Slay the Princess, and Rust.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4ft9u924I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xn4ft9u924I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previous Friends of Jimbo packs included crossovers with Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, and Stardew Valley. Balatro's inclusion onto  Game Pass is a surprise, as Microsoft already revealed the rest of the games that'll <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-getting-three-more-games-in-february-2025/2900-6268/" data-ref-id="2900-6268">join this month</a>, including Watch Dogs Legion, EA Sports F1 24, and Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader.</p><p>Balatro recently got its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-confusing-rating-finally-changed-leads-to-europe-changing-how-it-rates-gambling-games/1100-6529673/" data-ref-id="1100-6529673">European classification changed from PEGI 18 to PEGI 12</a> due to an appeal from the game's publisher. PEGI concluded that even though Balatro taught poker hands, its more fantastical and mystical elements mitigated the gambling aspects.</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>'s original Verdansk map would return to the free-to-play battle royale in 2025, but the publisher still hasn't provided further details for the map's release. Now, new leaks have surfaced to suggest a more "OG" version of Verdansk, detailing some of the map's main points of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">According to known Call of Duty insider "<a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" rel="nofollow ">The Ghost of Hope</a>," Verdansk will return with the launch of Season 3. The leaks also suggest that the map will be very similar to the original version that launched back in March of 2020, but the insider does detail a few minor differences.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">EXCLUSIVE Details on the return of Verdansk:<br>- Will launch with Season 3 of BO6<br>- It is pretty much the OG March 2020 version<br>- Train Station interior will be closed<br>- Interior of Stadium will be open BUT roof will be closed<br>- The Train returns<br>- No fast travel subway system <a href="https://t.co/69aAy79RLS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/69aAy79RLS</a></p>  â€” Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">One of the most notable details mentioned is that Verdansk will keep the Stadium point of interest with the roof intact. This might be a controversial map decision for Verdansk's return, as the original Stadium could often be a frustrating location to traverse. The building was usually plagued with rooftop campers, and it was also a massive structure to try and maneuver around while running from the gas.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Ghost of Hope does suggest that the interior of Stadium will be open this time, so hopefully players can use interior passages to better escape the area during a circle collapse. It's also worth noting that a post-launch update for Modern Warfare and Warzone included a Verdansk event that blew the top off Stadium to make the point of interest more viable. So, it's possible further map changes could arrive sometime after the return of Verdansk.</p><p dir="ltr">The insider claims that the train is returning with Verdansk, which was a feature that was not part of the original map design. The Train Station point of interest is also mentioned to be included on the map, but the station's interior will be closed off. A fast-travel subway system was added to Verdansk in a later season, but Ghost of Hope says this isn't planned for the map's return.</p><p dir="ltr">While all leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, it's worth mentioning that known Call of Duty dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1892643037462835327" rel="nofollow ">RealityUK</a> also claims that Verdansk references are now showing in the game files following the Season 2 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">If true, players won't have long to wait before the fan-favorite Verdansk returns. Based on the days left in the Season 2 battle pass, the Season 3 update should arrive to Black Ops 6 and Warzone around March 20. Until then, players can expect a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6270">TMNT-themed limited-time event</a> on February 27, and the Clover Craze event arrives on March 13 for early Saint Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>
