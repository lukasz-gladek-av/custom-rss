                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-is-giving-off-serious-animal-crossing-and-minecraft-vibes/1100-6534702/" data-ref-id="1100-6534702">it was announced</a> in September 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise.</p><p>It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-upcoming-pokemon-pokopia-may-have-a-deeper-link-to-classic-games-fans-believe-heres-what-we-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games.</p><p>Pokopia puts players in control of a Ditto that assumes human form and utilizes borrowed powers from other Pokemon to transform the landscape into a sanctuary free of human conflict. There don't appear to be any battles or a larger story in the game. But if it is set in a post-volcano explosion Cinnabar Island, it would be fitting if the land were healed by masterless Pokemon who weren't forced to fight each other.</p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will hit Switch 2 on March 5, 2026. In the meantime, fans of the franchise can immerse themselves in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That game has introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-has-found-a-new-way-to-battle-but-it-needs-to-evolve-past-that/1100-6536431/" data-ref-id="1100-6536431">a new way for Pokemon to battle</a>, but it may need some work before it can become a competitive esport.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games.</p><p>The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-6195688/" data-ref-id="1900-6195688">Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</a>, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zhsNdk1_Vc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zhsNdk1_Vc?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.</p><p>The success of that series helped cement the Homestar Runner universe as a surprisingly adaptable landscape for games. Beyond the Telltale collaboration, the franchise had already experimented with interactive experiences through its own iconic web games--Peasant's Quest, Stinkoman 20X6, and TROGDOR!--and later through the revival of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rMCkNgHa3c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trogdor!! The Board Game</a> and its digital version. Even when Strong Bad wasn't hogging the spotlight, his attitude, snark, and tendency to go off the rails remained woven into the fabric of these projects. With his latest return to the inbox, he's once again reminding the world that Free Country, USA is only an email away.</p>

                <p>The muted response to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from critics and fans appears to have translated into lower sales for the futuristic first-person shooter, with the game reportedly falling behind competitors in a few regions. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> described Black Ops 7's European launch as "disappointing," citing <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GSD</a>, which tracks physical and digital sales data.</p><p>Sales numbers for Black Ops 7's opening week are 63% below those of Battlefield 6, and The Game Business also estimates that sales are over 50% down compared to last year's Black Ops 6. Even still, the GSD numbers indicate that Black Ops 7 was still the top-selling game in Europe during its opening week.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite Japan not being a key market for the Call of Duty franchise, sales numbers there show a similar trend, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> reporting that Black Ops 7 had the worst Japanese launch in the franchise's history.</p><p>This doesn't paint a complete picture of how Black Ops 7 is performing--the game is included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, so there is certainly a good chunk of the playerbase not reflected in these early reported numbers.</p><p>Even still, Activision--which is usually quick to publicly brag about record-breaking sales or player counts after launching a Call of Duty game--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">uncharacteristically quiet about numbers after Black Ops 7 shipped</a>.</p><p>Reception to Black Ops 7, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-aim-assist-changes-and-weapon-balancing-are-coming-in-season-1-update/1100-6536402/" data-ref-id="1100-6536402">starts its first season in December</a>, was relatively lukewarm, with criticisms levied toward in-game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">assets allegedly generated by AI</a> and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-pause-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-so-you-better-hold-it-in/1100-6536212/" data-ref-id="1100-6536212">always-online story campaign</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty also arguably has tougher competition this year, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 skyrocketing in best-seller lists</a> and extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">Arc Raiders lapping Black Ops 7</a> in Steam player counts.</p>
