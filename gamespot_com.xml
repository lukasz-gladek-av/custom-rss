Project Breach introduces Amelia, the game's fourth major boss enemy, with a backstory quite unlike the others. Amelia joins the game's threesome of earlier monsters: the gory Mother Gooseberry, infantilized mafioso Franco Barbi, and would-be Stanford Prison Experiment all-star Sergeant Coyle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgB3XaGRjO0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgB3XaGRjO0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Amelia was once a victim trapped in the same titular trials as player characters find themselves in, but she escaped. Now, she's back to have her revenge, though she doesn't seem too discerning about who she kills when she gets there.</p><p>The newest map is called Downtown and is highlighted by its central Trial, or main mission, called Pleasure The Prosecutor. Along with that main mission, which is designed to take a group of four roughly 45 minutes on normal difficulty, two new side missions will also be set in the Downtown map. For players looking for new gear, the game's sixth class/cooldown ability comes with Project Breach, too. It's called The Jammer, though the team at Red Barrels hasn't yet disclosed how this one works.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061"></a><figcaption>Amelia isn't noticeably as unhinged as Mother Gooseberry, but her backstory paints a darker picture.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410062,1300-4410063,1300-4410064,1300-4410065" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"></figure><p>Alongside Project Breach, a new limited-time event kicks off on December 10, too. Winter Kills will give players a series of holiday challenges to complete and a host of new cosmetics to earn for their character and Sleep Room. You can even wear your very own Christmas jammies while running for your life down bloodied, tetanus-friendly halls. Even in the Murkoff Facility, it's the most wonderful time of the year, I suppose.</p><p>All of this begins on December 10 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.</p>

                <p>From the PC Gaming Show, the team behind the Twin Peaksy adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/virginia/" data-ref-id="5000-457375">Virginia</a> and Annapurna's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/last-stop-2021/" data-ref-id="5000-504770">Last Stop</a> has revealed Deepest Fear, a first-person horror-action game that blends an intriguing list of influences.</p><p>Citing movies like The Thing, The Abyss, and The Fly, Deepest Fear hopes to capture some of the subversive body-horror and creature-feature elements of the 1980s horror scene while pairing it with gameplay influences that are similarly beloved. Variable State calls the game a metroidvania immersive sim, and looked back on games like Metroid Prime, System Shock 2, and Dead Space to piece together its world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw5hRbtd7A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Set seven miles deep in the ocean, Deepest Fear casts players as Danni Carroll, a survivor aboard a facility called Neptune, where she must fend off inhuman enemies that emerge from the water. Unfortunately for players, Neptune is taking on water, leaving many opportunities for monsters to threaten her and others she encounters during her survival story. Using a "real-time fluid simulation," monsters can appear from any water source as it sloshes around the doomed facility, making enemy encounters unpredictable while inviting creative problem-solving in the vein of System Shock 2.</p><p>The project may sound like a far cry from what the team has made before--those being narrative-adventure games--but Variable State says the game is designed to keep intact the team's tradition of "confrontational storytelling." Besides, it's arguably not even the most surprising game the team has in the works. In 2025, Variable State is also self-publishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/polaris/" data-ref-id="5000-631974">Polaris</a>, a co-op shooter with a cel-shaded style.</p><p>Deepest Fear will arrive first on PC, but the team suggested future platforms will be announced later.</p>

                <p>A newly announced TMNT game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown/" data-ref-id="5000-653831">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, will see Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello eschew their usual genre of sidescrolling beat-em-up for a new turn-based adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">TMNT: Tactical Takedown comes from developer Strange Scaffold, the minds behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator/" data-ref-id="5000-525368">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> and this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/i-am-your-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-631987">I Am Your Beast</a>. The developer promises a "bold new approach" to the TMNT universe, and not just because of the game's turn-based tactics gameplay, a first for the franchise. It's also due to the game's story, which will see the Turtles growing apart as they teeter on the edge of adulthood in a world where Master Splinter and their arch nemesis Shredder are both dead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwKmulVHmXI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WwKmulVHmXI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, there will be 20 levels for players to battle through, divided into four campaigns focusing on different characters. Battle arenas will "grow, shrink, and add new threats each turn," with the game's visuals adopting a comic-book-style look combined with mini-figurines and dioramas. TMNT: Tactical Takedown will also sport a "multi-genre" soundtrack from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-paso-elsewhere/" data-ref-id="5000-532811">El Paso, Elsewhere</a> composer RJ Lake.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Turtle will have a customizable move set that looks to capitalize on their unique fighting styles while also allowing for clever use of the environment. Despite being turn-based, the game's debut trailer shows plenty of moving around, as the Turtles leap and bounce off enemies and reposition to set up their attacks for success.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for TMNT: Tactical Takedown just yet. It also looks like the game is currently only announced for PC, but that could change in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The TMNT have been busy in the world of video games recently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-releases-june-16-including-game-pass/1100-6504336/" data-ref-id="1100-6504336">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>, a return to the classic style of sidescrolling beat-'em-ups the heroes in a half shell are known for, released in the summer of 2022, followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga/" data-ref-id="5000-560206">TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, a package of 13 old-school TMNT games, just a few months later.
