                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is out now, and the series' first foray into Japan features many of its classic staples. This is noticeable early on during the <strong>altar puzzle</strong>, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the <strong>Silent Hill f altar puzzle</strong>.</p><h2>Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guide</h2><p>This first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-shrine-vault-puzzle-guide/1100-6534872/" data-ref-id="1100-6534872">shrine vault puzzle</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f locker codes</a>, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.</p><p>When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.</p><p>The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p><strong>Altar</strong></p><p>Thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.</p><p>Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.</p><p>A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.</p><p>Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.</p></div><p>If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them. Do so and you'll notice each has a symbol somewhere on them that matches the symbols on one of the altar's stands.</p><p>With this in mind, you simply need to place each offering on the altar that matches its symbol. If you're still stumped, don't fret. Here's the answer, plain as day to help you.</p><h2>Silent Hill f altar puzzle solution</h2><p>From left to right:</p><ol><li>Fan - front left</li><li>Fish - back left</li><li>Vase - front middle</li><li>Bird - back right</li><li>Mouse - front right</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367" data-ratio="0.57242063492063" data-width="1008" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f altar puzzle answer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png"></figure><p>Placing the offerings in this order will immediately solve the puzzle and initiate a cutscene. You'll then be trekking further into the fog world.

You'll come to a spot where you leave a home through a window and drop down from a rooftop, then you'll be told to return to the general store while avoiding enemies. As you work your way back through this area, you'll pass by a Hokora. From this point on, the Bonuses tab should unlock automatically when accessing one of these shrines. <strong>Open the Bonuses tab to obtain all of your pre-order items</strong>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I recently got to play around 20 minutes of the newest Hyrule Warriors game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" data-ref-id="5000-671281">Age of Imprisonment</a>, and there's a lot for fans of Zelda and Musou games to be interested in. For the former, it'll come as exciting news that Age of Imprisonment is canon. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/" data-ref-id="5000-518353">Age of Calamity</a> was pretty wishy-washy with alternate timeline ideas, Nintendo is going all-in for its follow-up and making everything you see in Age of Imprisonment true to the mainline story. We all know what happens in the end with Ganondorf, but there are, of course, a lot of questions about what happened before and after.</p><p dir="ltr">From a gameplay standpoint, Age of Imprisonment will let players get their hands on a good variety of characters from the canon and, given what I saw from just Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru, this is a <em>very</em> good roster filled with very exciting prospects.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Beyond the Legend – Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">During my time with Age of Imprisonment, we got to head underground with Rauru, Mineru, and Zelda, the latter of whom mentions that it is her first time in the depths and that she didn't know it existed. Mineru explains that the depths have multiple sites of sacred power and that she's been collecting constructs for her research. She wasn't able to investigate the depths on her own until Zelda and her powers of light came along to give them the ole' beatdown.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character, of course, had their unique style in combat, with Zelda both slashing with a strange Zonaite sword and wielding magical light projectiles; Rauru using spear and beam attacks; and Mineru utilizing a bunch of contraptions cobbled together from Zonai equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt right at home plowing through Little Frox, Frox, and Constructs, as someone who played a whole lot of Age of Calamity, but even those with <em>some</em> experience with any Musou game will likely find it easy to pick up. From the first game, you still have your regular and strong attack combos, dashes, flurry rushes, guarding, weakpoint smashes, crafting materials; the whole shebang. Attacks are flashy, have massive areas of effect, and are always fun to dole out punishment with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317" data-ratio="0.5625641025641" data-width="1950" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317"></a><figcaption>There are a lot of playable characters in this game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The R button menu has changed from the Sheikah Slate to unique skills in Age of Imprisonment. There's both a powerful dashing and vertical attack, and Zonai devices to either use whenever you'd like, or, in a better use case, can be used to counter an enemy's ability and slap 'em back in the face. The Y dashing version counters opponents dashing towards you, such as the construct's forward lunge, which has been pulled straight out of Tears of the Kingdom. The X version counters aerial or jumping attacks, such as the Frox's leap attack. These attacks can be used on their own for extra damage, but hitting specific counters seems much more worthwhile as they offer an opportunity to execute an extra follow-up at the end. These attacks have a cooldown, just like before with a successful use of a slate ability. The interesting thing is the A and B buttons are customizable Zonai equipment, each with specific properties that are changeable in the directional pad's right menu. This lets you switch your loadout on the fly depending on what the enemies' weaknesses are. The Zonai equipment uses Zonai batteries, which need to be replenished, however.</p><p dir="ltr">The cool thing about this is that some equipment can be placed into the environment and will operate automatically without your input, which can up the damage-dealing potential available. Since there's no friendly fire, there's a lot of opportunity to, for example, drop a flame emitter and work it into your overwhelming offense--thank Hylia.</p><p dir="ltr">Enemies also have traits and weaknesses that carry over from Tears of the Kingdom. Frox eat bombs, for example, and they're still weak to shots to the eye or attacks to their backside ores. That means that if you played Tears, you'll have a major leg up on the general idea of how to take on what you're up against.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319"></a><figcaption>Zelda has a lot of slashing and light-based attacks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where it really changes from Age of Calamity though is Sync Strikes. This is not just because it's a powerful attack that requires two characters, but it's <em>because</em> it needs two characters, and the nature of Musou games requires you to divide and conquer the map, making you strategize when characters should work together or go separately. This is an interesting twist on how these types of games are usually played.</p><p dir="ltr">Sync Strike attacks are the biggest game-changer in my opinion, because in the Age of Calamity, most characters were undertaking solo ventures and attacking different points of the map. But Sync attacks are so powerful that having two characters working together feels like a reliable way to plow through an enemy quickly and save time. This encourages you to strategize and always reconsider where to send units for best possible results, especially since Sync Strike attacks are slow to charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Sync Strike attack pair up varies depending on who is partaking and what you get ranges from multi-directional beams you can control to a completely alternate form like Mineru's powered-up construct. This means that some of these attacks will likely be better or worse in some situations, so there will no doubt be plenty of opportunities to test and experiment to optimize builds and runs. Just thinking about the final possible roster for this game and designing an interacting Sync attack across all characters sounds like a very daunting task, but as players, that means there's likely to be plenty of depth.</p><p>While the preview was fairly short, with a little teaser at the end, I got a pretty good idea of how good Age of Imprisonment feels, and it feels <em>damn</em> good. I think the fact that this game already has good legs, and I'm yet to see the characters I really want to see just makes me more excited for its release on November 6.</p>

While there are similarities in visual design language, detailed world-building techniques, and even gameplay elements between Death Stranding and Metal Gear, Death Stranding leans more heavily into overt sci-fi elements. Nevertheless, it's worth checking out if you're looking for more reading material based on Kojima's works. Both volumes are available in paperback and Kindle editions at Amazon.</p><p>Speaking of which, Kojima also wrote a nonfiction book in 2021, titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Gene-inspired-creator-Stranding/dp/197472591X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Creative Gene</a>, which compiles his memoirs and essays on creativity, game design, art, and more.

                <p>Annapurna Interactive went to Tokyo Game Show with three game reveals ready to go, and the results of its three-pronged showcase have resulted in an eclectic slate of upcoming games the company will be publishing. The team showed off a new puzzler in a strangely cozy dystopia, a turn-based RPG that's also part musical, and perhaps most interesting of them all, a game that looks quite like a Legend of Zelda sequel. Here's what you need to know about all three.</p><h2>D-topia</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up28VDHtDgU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>D-Topia is described as a puzzle game in which you play the role of a "Facilitator" working at the D-topia residential facility. There, you'll address concerns of the residents while uncovering a secret at the heart of the AI-run society. The "perfectly happy world" that the game is set in seems to be nothing more than a facade, and it's up to you to expose the reality of the situation. D-topia is developed by Marumittu Games and it's coming to PC, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox in 2026.</p><h2>People of Note</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXjlS7DLP4I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>People of Note is one part musical, one part turn-based RPG. Basically, it's the dream game for GameSpot's Jordan Ramee. Both the story and the game's combat mechanics lean into the musical aspect of the experience, giving players a big cast of characters who can belt out solos and beat down rivals. People of Note comes from Iridium Studios in 2026 for PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><h2>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWZHj4OraIA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is the one Zelda fans ought to circle on their calendars (if people still kept physical calendars, anyway). Demi and the Fractured Dream stars its titular hero, Demi, in a world called Somnus. Demi's quest has him chasing a means of escaping his "cursed fate" and is an ode to classic action-adventure games, with its hack-and-slash combat, environment puzzling, and an emphasis on its story and world. From the team at Yarn Owl, Demi hits PC, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox, and PS5 in 2026.</p><p>This was Annapurna's first time bringing news to Tokyo Game Show, but not nearly the first time it's revealed games I quickly wishlisted.
