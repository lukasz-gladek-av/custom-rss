                <p dir="ltr"><em>Minor spoilers for Hades and Hades II to follow--read at your own discretion.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Since its inception, Supergiant Games has built up a reputation around high-quality story experiences with deep gameplay systems to match. Yet while all the San Francisco-based studio's games are worthy of praise, it was the first Hades game that raised the bar when it came to roguelike games and their storytelling. It only makes sense, then, that it also became the first Supergiant title to earn a sequel.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Hades II carries over a lot of the features that made its predecessor such a beloved title, with one exception: its protagonist. This shift presented Supergiant with an exciting opportunity to explore new themes, making it disappointing that the end result instead plays into matronly stereotypes. While the first game had a protagonist who started out a cocky, sarcastic jackass before undergoing a deep and meaningful character arc, Hades II forgoes this in favor of making its female protagonist overtly stoic and duty-bound, playing into the misogynistic societal expectations for female-identifying people.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the Greek mythology version of the underworld, Hades told the story of Zagreus, son of the titular god of the Underworld. Unhappy with his life of luxury and comfort in the Underworld, Zagreus decides to leave and join the rest of the gods in Olympus. Along his way he fights numerous enemies in the underworld and the fields of Elysium in a Dante’s Inferno-esque journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Across Hades’ dozens of hours, players got to learn about Zagreus and witness his transformation from melancholic spoiled brat to suave, care-free warrior--the very embodiment of cool. He received a proper and fulfilling arc, one that helped cement the game as an instant classic and proved Supergiant could take a subject as vast as Greek Mythology and deliver a personal story about growth. Through their attempts to escape as Zagreus, players saw his character change, and demeanor soften. What could have been a modern-day interpretation of gods and mythology instead became a personal fable of growth, gratitude , and maturity. Hades’ tale strikes a chord and has universal appeal, no matter the audience.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Hades II, the unexpected sequel. How can a studio even follow up on a game that felt so complete? Sure, Greek mythology allows for countless tales and settings, but Hades felt so personal and laser-focused that one can’t help but wonder where to even go from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Hades II follows new protagonist Melinoë, the daughter of Hades and younger sister of Zagreus. After the home of Hades was sieged by Chronos, the God of Time, Mel was raised in the field of Elysium by the witch Hecate. Because Chronos launched his attack when she was a baby, Mel has never met her family and instead only knows them through information that she learned from others. Mel, desiring the family she has never known, decides to train with Hecate to kill Chronos and help her family reclaim their home, all while dealing with a war and invasion of Olympus in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">And herein lies the problem with the fable of Molinoë. Hades II starts in the middle of its story--Mel is already well into her training and the house of Hades has already fallen. We don’t know much about her as a character and even though we’re drip-fed information about her backstory throughout the game in the form of flashbacks, we never quite get to know her beyond her wanting to save her family.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607705"></a><figcaption>Melinoe vows to slay Chronos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first Hades game gave us a fully fleshed-out character and allowed them to grow throughout the narrative. Zagreus was allowed to be flawed, to take time to learn his own lessons, and to go through a rich, fulfilling character arc. Mel in Hades II, on the other hand, has her story and value tied to her family. She’s portrayed as having very few flaws aside from failing over and over again to save a family that she doesn’t know. Even when she gets wrapped up in a war for Olympus, she’s always solving other characters' problems. Throughout the game, we learn so little about her. Mel even loses agency in her own narrative when Zagreus gets involved in the third act, and it’s a staggering disappointment.</p><p dir="ltr">The problem with Mel’s quest being so intrinsically tied to her family is that it’s evocative of misogynistic ideologies--ideologies that proclaim a woman’s value is tied inherently to her family and that it should be the focus of her life and ambitions. Zagreus was allowed to be a cocky, smartass problem child who showed his flaws by going on a self-centered quest, so why isn’t Mel allowed something similar? Why isn’t she allowed to show flaws to a similar degree, or have a reckless attitude about certain situations?</p><p dir="ltr">I’m not asking for her to be a beat-for-beat repeat of Zagreus, but there was so much potential to explore certain themes with a female protagonist that Hades II fails to deliver on. At the start of Hades II, Mel is shown to be mature and established, as if she went through an entire character arc off-screen that we’re only drip-fed information about. Hades II having a protagonist like this only reinforces societal expectations that women need to mature faster, keep order, and focus on tasks at hand at the expense of self-exploration. Hades II could’ve done some interesting exploration of feminist themes using this set-up but instead forgoes it in favor of a stoic protagonist to offset their cheeky protagonist of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Hades II is an improvement on the first game--from the combat and upgrade systems, to the moment-to-moment gameplay. It’s just such a shame that Hades II fails its protagonist in such deep ways that it blemishes the entire experience. While Hades showed audiences how deep storytelling can be in a roguelike experience, Hades II fails to reach that same hallmark by giving us a protagonist that has little agency of her own and is often a fixer of other characters' problems.</p>

Everyone from Goku to Vegeta is included in the game's lineup, and while the combat does have a steep learning curve, once you nail it you'll be throwing out Final Flash and Kamehameha attacks like a pro. The game also looks stunning in action, and if you grew up playing the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi games, then this will appeal to you as it's a continuation of that series.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBQGRQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$30 (was $50)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>In comparison, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an action-RPG that blends fast-paced fisticuffs with level-grinding. The game also gives you a world to explore as you take part in Goku's greatest battles across the Dragon Ball storyline, and since launch, publisher Bandai Namco has expanded on the game with several story DLC drops inspired by classic OVA series and Dragon Ball Super. The Daima Edition does <em>not </em>include those expansions, but it does come bundled with the two-part Daima DLC, which is based on the Dragon Ball Daima anime series. One thing to note here is that only the first part has been released so far, and Part Two will arrive in early 2026.</p>                      </div>   </div><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Four notable free Switch 2 updates for big-name Nintendo games--such as Super Mario Odyssey--surprisingly came from outside the company. Instead of an internal developer, Panic Button has confirmed working on the following titles for the new hybrid console: Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, and Arms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/panicbuttongame/status/1991264499676930507?s=46" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Panic Button revealed its involvement on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/#3">the free Switch 2 updates</a>. "Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games," the Austin-based developer stated on social media. The improvements included HDR support for Arms, Super Mario Odyssey, and Bowser's Fury. In addition, GameShare support was added to Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/panicbuttongame/status/1991264499676930507?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.

For instance, the team was behind Doom and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-is-still-coming-to-nintendo-switch/1100-6461091/">Doom Eternal for the original Switch</a>. Panic Button assisted on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-an-impressive-/1100-6463299/">porting Warframe to Switch</a> as well. Most recently, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/">worked on Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>--marking the first time the racing franchise has appeared on a PlayStation platform.</p><p>In other Nintendo-development news, the company actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-buys-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-port-studio-ahead-of-switch-2-launch/1100-6523597/" data-ref-id="1100-6523597">acquired Shiver Entertainment</a>--a studio known for porting games like Hogwarts Legacy to Switch--last year. Shiver reportedly assisted in bringing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/#2">WWE 2K25</a> to Switch 2. Meanwhile, Panic Button is a private company. Speaking of ports, Switch and Switch 2 just saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-just-surprise-released-on-switch-and-switch-2/1100-6536324/">surprise release of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> earlier this week.</p>

                <p>While Fortnite is currently in the midst of a Springfieldian takeover by The Simpsons, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">next chapter of the battle royale's overarching story</a> will soon be upon us. Epic Games has ramped up the teases for what's to come, including a short trailer featuring a certain yellow-clad bride bent on revenge.</p><p>The trailer shows many of the main collaborations from Chapter 6--Godzilla, Homer Simpson, and the Megazord among them--before The Bride from Kill Bill speeds into the scene to save Jonesy from danger. The teaser then confirms the end-of-Chapter-6 event will take place November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwh7WFCW3f8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mwh7WFCW3f8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last night, Fortnite took over the Vista Theater in Hollywood, California for a massive Chapter 7 kickoff event for media and influencers that featured even more hints. Logos on decorations around the theater seem to confirm Chapter 7 Season 1's name as Pacific Break, while the DeLorean from Back to the Future also appeared in the theater itself.</p><p>One particularly interesting tidbit involves a poster for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQXUuwgZjX/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yuki's Revenge,</a> which appeared on official Fortnite social media accounts. Yuki's Revenge was meant to be a chapter of Kill Bill Volume 1, but it was removed from the final cut before the film released.</p><p>Among those spotted at the Vista included <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1991320132698927573" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino</a> and star Uma Thurman, and KPop Demon Hunters star Rei Ami--which could lend credence to rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-be-getting-kpop-demon-hunters-jam-tracks-after-all/1100-6536009/" data-ref-id="1100-6536009">more KPop Demon Hunters</a> content coming to the game soon.</p><p>Since the event, leaker ShiinaBR on X has reported multiple new details about the upcoming season, including hot-air balloons, the ability to drive Reboot Vans, and a Marty McFly skin.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">LEAKED CHAPTER 7 INFO FROM CREATOR EVENT 💀 <br>- Hot air balloons <br>- Driveable Reboot Vans<br>- Solo VS Bots mode <br>- Rift A Palooza events that spawn rifts<br>- Gameplay UI update<br>- Battle Pass has Marty McFly and The Bride <a href="https://t.co/l9lBrLZMIz" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/l9lBrLZMIz</a></p>  — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Fortnite is available now as a free download on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices.</p>
