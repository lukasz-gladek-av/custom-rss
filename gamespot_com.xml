                <p>Last fall, Microsoft unveiled an initiative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a>, even if it isn't on Game Pass. February's Xbox Update moves that agenda forward with over 50 playable games that Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now access on any supported devices as long as they own the titles.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/25/xbox-february-update-invite-links-cloud-gaming-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox's official site</a>, the following titles were among the recently added games that players can stream from their own collection.</p><ul><li>Blasphemous 2</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Slime Rancher 2</li><li>Subnautica</li><li>Subnautica: Below Zero</li><li>The Talos Principle 2</li><li>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</li></ul><p>Additionally, streaming support for the titles below will be added soon.</p><ul><li>Atomic Heart</li><li>Cult of the Lamb</li><li>Hotline Miami</li><li>Killer Frequency</li><li>Neva</li><li>Overcooked! All You Can Eat</li><li>Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate</li><li>Serious Sam Collection</li><li>Trepang2</li><li>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</li></ul><p>The latest update also makes it easier for Game Pass Ultimate members to invite their friends to take part in their Xbox Cloud Gaming beta sessions. For multiplayer titles, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can send out a single invite link via DM, group chat, or even on social media. In addition to consoles, this feature will work on web browsers and supported TVs if all players involved have an Xbox account as well a copy of the game. Some games will require Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions as well. The upper limit of players who can join using the invite link is determined by the number of users that each game allows.</p><p>Microsoft's network-quality indicator is now available to everyone participating in the Xbox Cloud Gaming beta. This tool is meant to help players detect any potential problems with their network connections, and also to keep track of the quality of those connections when using Cloud Gaming on supported devices.</p><p>Reports from last year indicated that Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-planning-for-direct-to-cloud-controllers-and-higher-quality-streams-report/1100-6527246/" data-ref-id="1100-6527246">direct-to-stream controllers and even-higher quality streams</a> for the future of the Cloud Gaming service. However, those improvements have yet to be implemented or officially announced.</p>
