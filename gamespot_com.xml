                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/" data-ref-id="1100-6533750">certain parties</a> targeting payment processors as a way to control what kinds of games are allowed to be sold, paying for games on services like Steam is a little bit weird right now. In fact, if you've tried to pay for something on Steam using PayPal recently, you might've noticed that the option isn't available. This is apparently isolated to certain countries, and now Valve has offered an explanation.</p><p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote on its <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Purchasing Issues support page</a>, as reported by RockPaper Shotgun. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD."</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," the page continues. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p><p>Valve further confirmed to RPS that this is "regarding content on Steam related to what we've previously commented on surrounding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/" data-ref-id="1100-6533641">Mastercard</a>."</p><p>"One of PayPalâ€™s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," Valve explained via a spokesperson.</p><p>In other words, unless you're paying with euros, pounds, dollars (US, Australia, Canada), or Japanese Yen, you can't make Steam purchases using PayPal for the time being.</p>
