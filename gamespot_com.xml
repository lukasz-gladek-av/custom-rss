                <p>The end of the year is shaping up to be a big one for SpongeBob SquarePants, as the hyper-energetic Goofy Goober fan has a new game out soon and a brand-new movie. To celebrate his big-screen return, Microsoft has revealed a new line of cursed Xbox controllers featuring the unblinking visage of SpongeBob. Just don't stare too long into the abyss, because it might stare back and offer you a greasy Krabby Patty to go.</p><p>SpongeBob fans can pick up limited-edition versions of the regular Xbox controller and the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller. Both controllers feature the same graphic of SpongeBob--but the Elite Series 2 has "pants" on the handles--yellow thumbsticks, and an orange D-pad. The Xbox home button and X face buttons have also replaced SpongeBob's pupils, but he seems to be in good spirits over being slightly inconvenienced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLBj2KuzPto" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uLBj2KuzPto" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since both of these controllers will also be available through the Xbox Design Lab, you can further customize them with a variety of button styles and upgrades like metallic triggers and D-pads, rubberized side and back grips, and engravings. Sadly, there's no option to give these devices a <a href="https://youtu.be/vpuRYLHf3ZE" rel="nofollow ">manly mustache makeover with some seaweed</a>.</p><p>These controllers will pair nicely with SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide. The new 3D platformer stars both SpongeBob and Patrick as they repair the damage done by King Neptune and the Flying Dutchman, and preorders are still open for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKVQ3PR3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">$40 standard edition</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKWK7734?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$90 Ghostly Tides Edition</a>.</p><p>If you feel like dropping $600 on SpongeBob merchandise--we know you're reading this, Patchy the Pirate--you can also preorder a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-claw-machine-from-arcade1up-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6536301/">new full-size SpongeBob Squarepants claw machine from Arcade1Up</a>. Just like the machines found in various malls and carnivals, this one even comes equipped with a "Scam Mode" to fleece you of your metaphorical pocket change.</p>

                <p>Nolan North is one of the most prolific voice actors of all time, lending his voice to hundreds of video games and animated series, but he didn't realize a character was supposed to be dead. That's mainly because Ubisoft told him he's still "technically" alive.</p><p>North had voiced Desmond Miles (among a few more characters) for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-assassins-creed-game-reviewed/2900-2178/" data-ref-id="2900-2178">Assassin's Creed series</a>. Desmond had been in five games, until the character's death in Assassin's Creed 3. It wasn't until he had gone online and came across fan reactions following the game's release that he was aware of this, however. </p><p>"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><p>Eight years after Assassin's Creed 3, in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla's ending explains that The Reader is Desmond--or the very least, his consciousness, which now lives on inside the Animus. It seems that Ubisoft creatives explained this to North years before he recorded the lines in Valhalla. Even then, it didn't seem that might have been the original plan either.</p><p>"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued. "But, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story--and it's done very, very well."</p><p>The latest entry of the franchise, <a href="https://gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-target="true">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>, was released back in the spring after a handful of delays. There are also long-standing rumors about a Black Flag remake, which reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">will be Animus-free</a>.</p>
