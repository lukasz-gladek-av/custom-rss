Capcom has announced the Event Quest schedule for Monster Hunter Wilds, which gives players a chance to earn exclusive gear.</p><p>The Event Quests are somewhat similar to live-service content in other games, but the key difference is that Capcom isn't charging players to take part in these limited-time events. The first two Event Quests, Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo and Stalking Supper, are already live. Players who complete these hunts can earn the Mimiphyta α headgear and Kunafa cheese, respectively. But those Event Quests will only run until March 10, when the next events begin. The complete schedule--with rewards and requirements--is included below.</p><h3>March 3</h3><p><strong>Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Yian Kut-Ku to obtain materials for the Mimiphyta α headgear!</li></ul><p><strong>Stalking Supper - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Quematrice to obtain Kunafa Cheese that you can use as an additional ingredient when cooking.</li></ul><h3>March 10</h3><p><strong>Tongue-Tied - 5 Stars (HR 21 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Tempered Chatacabra to obtain Hard Armor Spheres and Advanced Armor Spheres to upgrade armor.</li></ul><p><strong>Kut-Ku Gone Cuckoo - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Yian Kut-Ku to obtain materials for the Mimiphyta α headgear.</li></ul><h3>March 17</h3><p><strong>Ballet in the Rain - 5 Stars (HR 21 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Tempered Lala Barina to obtain Glowing Orb - Swords to use as weapon decorations.</li></ul><p><strong>Sand-Scarred Soul - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher)</strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Doshaguma to obtain Glowing Orb - Armors to use as armor decorations.</li></ul><p><strong>Like a Fire Hidden by Sand - 4 Stars (HR 9 or higher) </strong></p><ul><li>Hunt the Rathian to obtain the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition.</li></ul><p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-top-5-all-time-on-steam-for-concurrent-players/1100-6529828/" data-ref-id="1100-6529828">the top five for most concurrent players of all time on Steam</a>, peaking at over 1.3 million.
