                <p>While Naughty Dog has only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">teased the third installment in The Last of Us franchise</a>, co-writer and director Neil Druckmann discussed recently sequels are never part of his initial plans. Talking along with Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, the two chatted with an audience about their doubts about their creative process.</p><p>After taking a few pre-submitted audience questions, one came across which asked about the development of sequels and how to maintain character development over multiple games. Druckmann said he goes one game at a time and doesn't think that far ahead.</p><p>"That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games because I'm the game in front of us is so all-consuming," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he responded (via IGN)</a>. "I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, 'what if I never get to do another one?' I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here."</p><p>Druckmann expanded on how his method for character arcs works which simply boiled down to if they can't move forward, he said he jokingly would kill them off.</p><p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'," he explained.</p><p>"And we have to come up with a new answer," he continued. "And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?‚Äù</p><p>Speaking of new, back in November, Druckmann confirmed during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion--appearing alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine--that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-hes-been-working-on-new-game-since-2020-and-that-makes-sense/1100-6527766/" data-ref-id="1100-6527766">he was working on his first new game since 2020</a>.</p><p>"I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said at the time.</p><p>Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us premieres on Max in April and will cover some of the events The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has sent a loud and clear message to the cheaters and hackers of the world about Fortnite. The company "took legal action" against a pro player called RepulseGod and banned them from ever participating again in organized tournaments for the battle-royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of that, RepulseGod, whose name is Morgan Bamford, had to return prize money from Fortnite back to Epic. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> reports that the company then donated the reclaimed funds to the <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/" rel="nofollow ">Child's Play Charity</a>, which provides games and technology to children's hospitals. Last but not least, RepulseGod released a public apology video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a> summarizing the situation--which <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" rel="nofollow ">the Fortnite Competitive account on X</a> also highlighted.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XouE9KalIVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments, and I apologize to the Fortnite community for my actions," RepulseGod posted in text on the apology video.

                <p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones said that he's going to be in a new remastered Tony Hawk game, despite Activision not announcing any new ones.</p><p>"I'm in a Tony Hawk [game] coming out, so they got a new one they're remastering...that's about to come out. I was in the last one," Jones said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPaLb7i-ezl_iTk1bqEwOkJmHOXgFbMax" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Breakfast Club</a>.

Although it's unclear which game he's referring to, he may have also meant remakes. Last year, Tony Hawk's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake was reportedly</a> rejected in order for developer Vicarious Visions to focus on more Call of Duty content. However, Tony Hawk himself came out and confirmed that the series will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">continue on in some form</a>.</p><p>It's unknown what the future of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise holds, but former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">recently revealed</a> that Activision offered Hawk $300,000 and a 1.5% royalty rate to lend his name and likeness to the first game on the original PlayStation. At the time, Kotick claimed that the famous skater was desperate and living out of his car, but his fortunes turned around, as he earned four million in royalty checks from Pro Skater 4.</p>

                <p>Days Gone Remastered will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-preorders-are-now-live-ps4-owners-can-upgrade-for-just-10/1100-6529487/">affordable $10 upgrade</a> to anyone who owns the 2019 survival-action game, but there is a catch here. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-might-not-be-able-to-redeem-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps-plus-extra/1100-6505626/">Like several other PlayStation games</a> that have gotten the PS5 remaster treatment, the upgrade doesn't apply to the PS Plus version currently available in the Game Catalog, or the one that was given away back in April 2021 as a PS Plus freebie.</p><p>Naturally, this hasn't gone over well with fans who have taken to online forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fans-upset-days-gone-remastered-10-ps5-upgrade-offer-doesnt-work-if-you-only-own-the-game-via-ps-plus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) to voice their complaints. As several people have noted, PS Plus is a paid-for subscription service, and in comparison, Microsoft allows Game Pass subscribers to upgrade to premium editions of new releases, allowing them to access the benefits of their upgraded games--like early access--at an attractive price. It is worth noting that you'll still need to purchase the base game on Xbox, if you plan to keep playing without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMWMJdvdRQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XVMWMJdvdRQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another point of contention brought up is that Sony still allows its users to purchase DLC for PS Plus games, and many see the "Remaster" upgrade of Days Gone as a somewhat similar piece of content that can be added onto a game. "This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS Plus game," CoolGur878 wrote. "And, mind you, PS Plus is not a free service."</p><p>Whatever Sony's reasoning, it clearly hasn't gone over well with a vocal section of the Days Gone fandom. For everyone else interested in seeing Deacon St. John's zombie-apocalypse adventure on PS5, there are some impressive visual upgrades to look forward to when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/" data-ref-id="1100-6529467">Days Gone Remastered arrives on April 25</a>.</p><p>Increased foliage draw distance, improved shadow and lighting quality, and VRR support are some of the features being touted by developer Bend Studio, and the game will also come with new content like speedrun, permadeath, and horde modes.</p>

It's been reported that the PS6 is in the works, and according to former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, the system launching in 2028 feels "right."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida the last console cycle was about seven years long, and if that holds again, the PS6 would debut in 2027, and he said that feels "a bit too early." Stressing that he has no inside information about the PS6, Yoshida said, "If the next PlayStation comes out in 2028, that feels right to me."</p><p>He added that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-console-generation-may-start-in-2028-xbox-court-docs-say/1100-6515423/" data-ref-id="1100-6515423">next Xbox might be planned for 2028 as well</a>, based on a leak from Microsoft, but of course, this may not be true and plans can always change. In any event, Yoshida speculated that there is a chance that the next PlayStation and Xbox devices come out in the same year.</p><p>This would be in keeping with tradition, as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S debuted in not just the same year but the same month back in November 2020.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say that the PS5 generation was "slowed" due to manufacturing issues pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and component shortages. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/" data-ref-id="1100-6529481">PS5 just had its biggest sales quarter yet, propelling the system to more than 75 million sold.</a> PS5 sales are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">up compared to PS4 sales in the US over their first 50 months</a>, while Xbox Series X|S sales are down compared to Xbox One.</p><p>It was reported in 2024 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">Intel made a blockbuster bid with Sony to have its own chips help power the PS6</a>. However, Sony is said to have opted to go with AMD instead. AMD currently helps power both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">left Sony earlier this year after 30+ years with the company</a>. Now that he's left Sony, he can arrange his own interviews and speak his mind, and he is certainly doing that. He also recently said he had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">"no choice"</a> but to take a job inside Sony focused on indie games. He says he was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536"> told he could accept this position or leave.</a> Yoshida also reacted to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">it lacked surprises.</a> Additionally, he offered up a theory as to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there is no Bloodborne remaster</a> and revealed that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised that Horizon: Forbidden West didn't sell all that great.</a></p>
