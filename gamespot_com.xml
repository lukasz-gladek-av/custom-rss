                <p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-strategy-game-will-be-revealed-in-april/1100-6530159/" data-ref-id="1100-6530159">Star Wars game is being revealed soon</a>, and some images from it have apparently emerged online. The images are supposedly taken from the Star Wars strategy game developed by Bit Reactor. The studio was founded by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-xcom-civilization-devs-have-formed-a-new-studio/1100-6499799/" data-ref-id="1100-6499799">former XCOM developers</a> and partnered with Respawn Entertainment on the project. </p><p>Found by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, these images were spotted in a Bit Reactor artist's portfolio. They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is "Bruno" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Some of the screenshots show gameplay where Mandalorians and a droid take cover while others depict the user interface. One shows what looks like the hub area, called Kafrene Mining Colony.</p><p>As these images are over a year old, it's also possible that the final release could look drastically different. The official <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars website</a> states that there will be a first look at Respawn and Bit Reactor's project during Star Wars Celebration in Japan on April 19.</p><p>This Star Wars project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/1100-6499936/" data-ref-id="1100-6499936">not the only one in the works right now</a>.
