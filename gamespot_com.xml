Manufactured by frequent Nintendo accessory collaborator Hori, both wheels come with pedals and sport wired USB connections. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel-Deluxe/dp/B01C6XAO7M?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori's Mario Kart Pro Deluxe Racing Wheel</a></strong> is discounted to only $77, down from $110.

The Switch 2 Dock has two USB-A ports, so you <em>should </em>be able to use Hori's wheels to play Mario Kart World. Wired and Bluetooth Switch controllers are supposed to work just fine on Switch 2, and this should especially be true when dealing with officially licensed accessories like Hori's Mario Kart wheels.</p><p>We have reached out to Hori to confirm Switch 2 compatibility and will update this story if we hear back. Just know that there is a chance neither wheel will work on Switch 2. We'd be very surprised, but until we test it for ourselves or receive official confirmation, we can't be fully sure about any potentially backward compatible accessory.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joy-con-2-wheel-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-walmart/1100-6530571/" data-ref-id="1100-6530571">Nintendo is releasing Joy-Con 2 wheel attachments</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-game-accessory-preorders-are-live/1100-6530753/" data-ref-id="1100-6530753">Switch 2 and Mario Kart World on June 5</a>. You'll be able to slot a Joy-Con 2 Controller in the wheel and play Mario Kart with motion controls.

Beyond the larger size and more premium feel, the biggest additional perk is the inclusion of removable paddles.

                <p dir="ltr">Deadlock--the MOBA that Valve famously did not acknowledge after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-valves-rumored-moba-shooter-deadlock-leaks-online-showing-off-steampunk-action/1100-6523639/">months of leaked footage</a>, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/">confirm its existence last summer</a>--has been slowly inviting more and more players to its ongoing closed alpha test. However, it now seems as if there's an even more hidden alpha test, with even more limited invitations, after a streamer accidentally spilled the beans.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Deathy was livestreaming Deadlock on his YouTube channel, when he seems to have booted up the wrong version of the game. Instead of the alpha test viewers were used to, instead the game loaded up additional characters--a roster of 40 available characters as opposed to the standard alpha's 30 playable heroes--as well as updated designs for some of those 30 heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters not found in the usual alpha test include a bellhop-themed character named Doorman, a reference to Mary Shelley's famous monster called Frank, and a character named Punkgoat whose art is a repeat of existing character Shiv. Deathy did end the stream and delete the archive when he realized his error, but screenshots still managed to hit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1kckaic/slight_oversight_from_the_deathy_tierlist/" rel="nofollow ">official Deadlock subreddit</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadlock is a 6v6 multiplayer shooter and MOBA--"multiplayer online battle arena"--game developed by Valve. The official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> says that the game is "in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay" and that "access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters."</p>

Devolver Digital, which back in March <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1904864488982995454" rel="nofollow ">declared they would release a game</a> on the same day as GTA 6 no matter the release date, has re-committed to the bit--though we still don't know what game that will be of if this is all one big joke.</p><p dir="ltr">After Rockstar announced the delay, Devolver Digital posted on its X account acknowledging both the delay and its dedication to directly competing with Rockstar on launch day. "You can't escape us," the post reads. "May 26, 2026 it is, then." The specific game in question, if there is one, has not yet been confirmed by Devolver.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the delay of whatever game the company plans to launch against GTA 6, Devolver Digital has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6526471/" data-ref-id="1100-6526471">busy 2025</a> ahead of it. The publisher has already launched Look Outside, Gorn 2, and Shotgun Cop Man so far, with Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Possessors still scheduled between now and the end of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar Games's parent company Take-Two Interactive, despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-had-this-major-effect-on-rockstars-parent-company/1100-6531286/" data-ref-id="1100-6531286">a slump in stock price</a> after the announcement of the delay, also has a busy release schedule ahead of it. Civilization VII from Firaxis Games and WWE 2K25 from Visual Concepts have already seen release, with Mafia: The Old Country, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, and NBA 2K26 still to come before 2026 begins.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, and that's going to have negative ramifications on the total video game industry market. That's according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who discussed these negative consequences in a new interview.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/i-dont-think-anyone-benefits-in-2025-from-this-gta-6-delay-is-bad-news-for-the-games-industry-analyst-says-adding-to-nightmare-scenario-territory-following-xbox-price-hike/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GamesRadar</a>, Piscatella said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> is a mass-market game that is expected to bring back lapsed console players and will help sell PlayStation and Xbox consoles in general. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-passes-700000-concurrent-players-during-early-access/1100-6525040/" data-ref-id="1100-6525040">similar phenomenon was observed with CFB 25 last year</a>. EA hadn't released a college football game since 2013, and there was a lot of pent-up demand for CFB 25.</p><p>For GTA 6, not only is expected to lift console sales, Piscatella it could bring growth overall to the video game market and might also "reinvigorate investor interest" following a period of investment firms scaling back in terms of funding video games and studios.</p><p>So with GTA 6 being delayed, Piscatella said, "I don't think anyone benefits in 2025 from this push." He added: "It wasn't looming over the holiday season; it was going to be a big driver of what success potential the holiday season had."</p><p>Now that GTA 6 is no longer coming in 2025, Piscatella said he is projecting total spending on the video game market in the US to fall in the "mid single-digit percentage range." Spending could fall to the lowest since before the pandemic, he said.</p><p>Piscatella went to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lo6zo3mo7k2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">say on social media</a> that GTA 6 being delayed to 2026 does not mean there will suddenly be a "whole bunch of other dollars available for other games" this year. "It just means that a bunch of the dollars that would have been spent on gaming this year have disappeared," he said.</p><p>Before this, Piscatella said he predicted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">launches of GTA 6 and Switch 2 in 2025 would help lift total video game industry sales in 2025</a>. He also said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important video game release in history.</a></p><p>Although GTA 6 is no longer coming in 2025, Take-Two still has Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country on tap for this year, in addition to its roster of sports titles. Across the industry overall, it's expected that Activision will launch in a new Call of Duty game this year, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> are no doubt expected to help lift total video game industry sales. There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">possibility of Battlefield 6 coming this year</a>, but that's not confirmed. </p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to release in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but it's now set for launch on May 26, 2026.</p>
