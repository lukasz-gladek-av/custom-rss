              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">To longtime fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> represents the next evolution of a beloved franchise. Instead of using Pokemon's traditional turn-based combat, this new game embraces more frenetic, real-time combat. This approach feels bold and transformative, as it seems to reimagine Pokemon as a light action game. However, not all fans are on board with this decision, which breaks with the series' decades-long tradition of using turn-based combat in core console releases.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, it seems like the mainline Pokemon games struggle to innovate. Leadership at The Pokemon Company often relegate new gameplay experiences to neglected spin-off series or mobile games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or Pokemon Go. So getting what many fans see as a "mainline" console game with a new gameplay gimmick has been welcomed by fans begging the series to reinvent itself. However, new changes bring risks. Although Pokemon Legends: Z-A might have found a new way to battle, it still lacks the rigor of the mainline games and likely won't inspire a larger competitive scene around it, even if the bones are good.</p><p dir="ltr">The developers at Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have added several key features to Legends: Z-A that, on the surface, make the game seem streamlined for competitive play. Unlike its predecessor, Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Legends: Z-A allows players to battle online and progress up a ladder. These battles toss four trainers in a space together, in which they run around and fight each other. The more Pokemon you defeat, the more points you get, which ultimately elevates your trainer rank when the fight is done.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549"></a><figcaption>A look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A's online multiplayer mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This way of battling can result in chaotic and fun antics. Having four people run around all at once feels like a free for all with your friends. You can target someone who already has low health with a well-timed attack or switch at the right moment to avoid a big attack from an opponent. However, as good and fun this can be, it might not be enough to inspire a lasting competitive community around the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Among those who are more skeptical of this pivot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoeUX9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoeUX9</a>, a Pokémon coach and two-time regional champion. JoeUX9 explained why turn-based battles work better for the competitive scene than the gameplay in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr">“[Turn-based battling] suits a one-vs-one, turn-based play style, where you can't ‘dodge’ attacks and it's more of a chess style of play. It leans more into the strategic and calculated style of Pokemon, whereas the battle royale ranked battles in ZA reward a reaction-based method where you aren't going through things turn by turn, but rather consistent action for four minutes.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skrawvgc">Skraw</a>, a competitive Pokemon player and YouTuber, told GameSpot that he thinks the Legends: Z-A battle system could lead to a larger competitive scene, but not in its "current iteration."</p><p dir="ltr">"It has a lot of elements of a good real-time game," Skraw said. "For example, I think using switching and Mega evolution as a way to get immunity frames to dodge attacks feels very rewarding. But I think the way your agency sort of vanishes to pre-programmed pathing and jank would make it frustrating to play with any real stakes on the line. I'd say the system has good bones, but needs to be polished."</p><p dir="ltr">Key ways of strategizing present in the turn-based games, like using status effects, buffs, and debuffs to your advantage, are adapted in somewhat bizarre ways; oftentimes, their implementation feels awkward. In my own experience using the teams I have built based on recommendations online, it's better to wham on your opponents with the strongest and quickest attacks possible. You don't really need to think about setting up a larger strategy and often, that feels like cheesing. Additionally, key aspects of the turn-based games, like Pokemon abilities, aren't present in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUziGunner">TheUziGunner</a>, a competitive player and veteran of the Pokemon Draft League, told GameSpot that a solid battle system requires a "mix of strategy and creativity."</p><p dir="ltr">"Incentivisation for teambuilding and proper lines of sequence akin to chess and long-term planning which get rewarded with the battle system," TheUziGunner said. "That is what best works for the existing turn-based combat players including myself as there is nothing more satisfying in seeing a substantial payoff in having hours of serious effort pertaining to teambuilding and paying off through outplaying our opponent. If these aspects can be retained in real-time combat, then I absolutely see it cultivating a serious competitive scene!"</p><p dir="ltr">He told GameSpot he appreciates certain aspects of battling, like positioning and cooldowns for certain moves, but this way of battling can still feel unbalanced at points.</p><p dir="ltr">""It still feels rather unbalanced as you can see Xerneas moving like a Nascar after [using] Geomancy. I also believe the lack of abilities in the game is an inherent negative rather than a positive as it prevents the scope of complexity and more creativity as far as the battle system goes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550"></a><figcaption>A Pokemon trainer poses next to their Krookodile.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The vast majority of people playing Legends: Z-A aren't going to be doing so competitively. However, competitive players can speak to the depth and consistency of mechanics, and thus the overall likelihood that this game will inspire a competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">Competitive Pokemon and live events are becoming a larger part of the fandom. Whether or not a game like Legends: Z-A is competition-worthy is the difference between being a game people complete and put down, and the mainline games where people continue to tinker with different combinations of teams for years to come. It's one key way for a fandom to develop around a game and sustain continued engagement with it, whether it's events tied to it or new content exploring the meta as players continue to tinker with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite gaps in the current battle system, both Skraw and TheUziGunner emphasized that the new system has good bones. Whether or not this new way of battling can become a larger phenomena will depend on if The Pokemon Company and Game Freak continue to sharpen the battle system in Pokemon Legends: Z-A and future games, and plan events supporting a competitive scene tied to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, if Legends: Z-A can get more people excited about playing Pokemon, then it can still help the competitive community. The Pokemon Company plans to release Pokemon Champions, a game that will focus on battling and serve as the software for the official Pokemon world tournament, in 2026. Legends: Z-A could get new players through the door that then try Pokemon Champions out, which could in turn convert people into competitive players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Pokemon's competitive scene needs two things to grow in my opinion and that's attention and lower barriers to entry," Skraw said. "We've seen, especially after this year's worlds, that The Pokemon Company International is putting more of a spotlight on the competitive aspect of the game, with coverage of events getting more thorough, commentary following storylines of trainers, more matches getting streamed etc. I think we're already on the trajectory for Pokemon's various competitive scenes to get larger and larger."</p>

<section><p>After a rocky launch, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus is making a comeback with a major update that adds new challenges and gameplay updates.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, indie game publisher Humble Games went through what it called a restructuring, a process that resulted in mass layoffs. Not only were various staff members affected, but also several games under the publisher, including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. Developed by the small team at Squid Shock Studios, the colorful platformer inspired by Japanese folklore would turn out to be the final title published by the in-house team at Humble Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Fast-forward to November 2025, and Squid Shock Games is still hard at work on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. The team has just released the free Tanuki Kabuki update for the game, a major content drop that adds new post-game challenges, gameplay options, and collectibles to the game, with one of the highlights being a Kabuki-style Boss Rush mode where players battle in front of an audience that reacts to each clash. A new Gauntlet Mode has also been added, and this is a curated selection of challenges that also features customizable difficulty options.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting here wasn't easy for Squid Shock Games, as following the restructuring of Humble, the team had to fill multiple roles that the publisher had previously handled. We spoke to creative director Chris Stair about how the studio bounced back, was forced to adapt at the 11th hour, and the lessons learned from this ordeal.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Xd91I3jjs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d4Xd91I3jjs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Honestly, the main thing was it left me--and my whole team at Squid Shock--feeling completely confused, abandoned, and lost right after launching our very first game. Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus was the first title Squid Shock ever released and the first game I'd ever worked on in my life. We had launched literally five days before Humble's restructuring hit," Stair said. "My team and I were on an absolute high. We were at Bit Summit in Kyoto, Japan, meeting devs we'd idolized for years, throwing an incredible launch party, soaking in all the love from the community. And then, overnight, it felt like the ground just vanished beneath us. Even just recollecting it right now makes my cortisol spike."</p><p dir="ltr">Stair added that it was a disheartening experience to see the news about Humble Games and receive emails from former employees at the publisher, many of whom he'd worked with on marketing the game. In a more practical sense, however, Stair now had to confront the fact that all the previously arranged post-launch publisher support had been dramatically altered. "No matter what anyone else might say, our launch was absolutely sullied by this. Not just the practical stuff, but my entire emotional and psychological state. So much mental bandwidth got eaten up by pure insecurity about what the hell was going to happen next that the studio and I went straight into survival mode. Resources and energy that should have gone into nurturing the game in its critical first weeks instead went into just keeping our heads above water," Stair said.</p><p dir="ltr">Following its departure from Humble Games, Squid Shock had to adapt and fill multiple behind-the-scenes roles--like marketing, press, creator outreach, gathering storefront feedback and sentiment, QA coordination, localization fixes, and more--quickly, but the single biggest "nightmare" for the studio were the console patches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus  </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stair explained that Humble had been their middleman with console companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. When the publisher restructured, their connections to the big three were greatly impacted, ultimately resulting in an inability to release vital updates. "It really sucked reading player feedback about bugs and performance issues on certain platforms and knowing we literally couldn't do anything about it for months," Stair said. "I think this really irreparably damaged our reputation on certain platforms, especially Xbox, which had some nasty crashes on launch."</p><p dir="ltr">While sales of Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus were "moderately successful," they didn't meet the expectations that Squid Shock had for the game. "We were given a conservative estimate of how many copies we would sell in the first year and we really fell short of that," Stair added. "Is that because of the issues we had with Humble? There's no way to actually prove it, but obviously that whole situation only hurt our ability to deliver a better product over time."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The tragedy here is that Squid Shock had a good working relationship with Humble before its sudden closure. Stair says that while they weren't perfect, the publisher knew what it was doing and it "provided incredible support throughout development" that would not have been there if the studio had gone down the self-publishing route. As Stair explained, publishers do far more than just help get a video game out the door, as a good company can help with QA, localization, production timelines, porting, trailers, subscription deals, and so much more. All essential factors in a game finding success in a crowded and very competitive market.</p><p dir="ltr">Squid Shock is now working with Good Games Group,a publishing group founded by former Humble employees. If you're interested in seeing Bo: Path Of The Teal Lotus in action, it'll be featured in a Games Done Quick livestream this weekend.</p>

                <p>Europe's law enforcement agency is taking a closer look at online multiplayer games and gaming-adjacent platforms as the fears that criminals could be grooming, manipulating, and weaponizing children to commit violent crimes rise sharply in European society.</p><p>Europol (or the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) partnered with eight countries to identify and remove thousands of incidents of hateful rhetoric shared on gaming and gaming-related platforms. Conducted on November 13 and in partnership with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Europol's <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-and-partner-countries-combat-online-radicalisation-gaming-platforms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Referral Action Day program</a> reportedly uncovered around 5,408 links to jihadist content, 1,070 links to violent right-wing extremist and terrorist content, and 105 links to racist and xenophobic content on a variety of unnamed gaming platforms.</p><p>Europol's executive director, Catherine De Bolle, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/children-groomed-for-murder-through-video-games-europol-warns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to Politico</a> on November 21 about her fears following the findings by that joint committee dubbed the European Union Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). De Bolle said that, through these gaming platforms, criminal networks are recruiting children to engage in torture and murder.</p><p>"The weaponization of children for organized crime groups is what is going on at the moment on European soil," she said. "They weaponize the children to torture or to kill. It's not about petty theft anymore. It's about big crimes. [In one] worst-case, [we've seen a young boy who was ordered] to kill his younger sister, which happened. It’s cruel; we have never seen this before."</p><p>Europol discovered that criminals start grooming children by first joining their online multiplayer chats to talk about innocuous topics like family and pets. These public chats then move to more private servers where children are convinced to share sensitive data, such as family names and home addresses. With this knowledge, criminals could bribe or blackmail children into harming their families or themselves.</p><p>The Referral Action Day program uncovered all kinds of dangerous and violent content after combing through copious gaming and streaming platforms. According to the EU IRU's findings, criminals would re-enact terrorist attacks, executions, or school shootings in a game, edit videos with chants or suggestive emojis, and then share them on many commonly used social media platforms.</p><p>Europol claimed there have been at least 105 instances, including 10 contract killings, where violent crimes were "performed as a service" by children. Sometimes, the children were offered as much as $20,000 to commit the act, though Europol said not every child received their payment. If a child, viewed as a kind of remote-operated weapon, doesn't commit the act, then the criminals will shock them with horror as a reminder of what's owed.</p><p>"We also have children who do not execute the order and then, for instance, [the criminals] kill the pet of the child, so that the child knows very well, 'We know where you live, we know who you are, you will obey, and if you don't, we will go even further to kill your mother or your father,'" De Bolle explained. "Parents blame themselves in a lot of cases. They do not understand how it is possible. The problem is you don’t have access to everything your child does and you respect also the privacy of your children. But as a parent, you need to talk about the dangers of the internet."</p><p>Whether the child is bullied at school, has psychological problems, or is healthy and happy, De Bolle said no minor is safe. Criminals even go as far as extending the nature of the crime, from domestic violence to information spying for a hybrid war by state actors.</p><p>"You also have it with hybrid threat actors that are looking for the crime as a service model--the young perpetrators to listen to the foreign state, to listen to the communication around buildings," De Bolle said.</p><p>Though not specifically cited by Europol and the EU IRU, the game creation platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> has raised alarms for parents and politicians over the years regarding children's safety concerns. The platform, which has a player base that's mostly under the age of 13, has been at the center of a handful of recent lawsuits over child exploitation and grooming. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> are suing developer Roblox Corporation for failing to protect kids.
