                <p>Veteran RPG developer and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain argues that modern games have forgotten some lessons of history--a point he made in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>--you can watch the full video below--responding to a viewer's question about whether older titles contain any supposed lost wisdom. Cain's answer--"Yes, there is. Good question." Looking back at his own early years in the industry, he describes an era with only programmers and some artists, but no narrative designers, and far fewer competing priorities. In contrast, he says today's games "try to be everything to everyone."</p><p>In about 13 minutes, Cain explains how he attributes the sharp focus of early games to the era's severe technical limitations and fragmented hardware landscape. "Games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles," he recalled, with no shared standards to ease development. Teams were small and multitasking was essential--programmers often acted as artists and sound designers, reverse-engineering undocumented hardware to make their games function.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YEF1Ankos0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"These games were really focused, because they had to be," he explained.</p><p>The first major lesson he believes modern developers should reclaim is the importance of efficiency. With the tiny memory budgets and slow processors of the 1980s, Cain says, "you write efficient code or your game doesn't work on the Atari console." Designers were equally constrained: They couldn't stack crafting systems, puzzles, companion mechanics, and sprawling narratives on top of each other. Instead, they had to choose a single segment of gameplay and perfect it.</p><p>"The idea that you could have a core game loop that was a huge variety of actions just did not exist," Cain added, noting that a game like Gauntlet had to nail its narrow focus on dungeon-clearing because that was the entire experience.</p><p>Cain warns that today's games risk "becoming indulgent" by adding features that "dilute the game" rather than improve it. To illustrate, he compares 1980s game design to a high-end restaurant where a chef prepares a superb dish from a few exceptional ingredients, while modern blockbuster games resemble buffets that prioritize variety over quality. His advice for developers--especially those in small indie teams--is straightforward: simplify.</p><p>"You need to be simple. You need to stay focused, and whatever you do has to be extremely well executed. And then you'll be like that fancy restaurant ... that meal was delicious."</p><p>People in the comments, though, were mixed on this observation. Games like Fallout 4 were brought up, and how that has crafting, companion quests, community building, and is a fan-favorite out of the series. Conversely, one commenter in their early 20s went back to play the original Diablo and found it kept them engaged, with practically none of the "modern tactics" that they were used to.</p>

The demand for this was strong, so much so that The Game Awards website crashed--now, organizer and host Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1991166862147891256" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apologized for the website's struggles</a> and said work was done to improve the experience.</p><p>"We've seen truly unprecedented levels of global voting activity for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/read-our-reviews-for-2025s-game-of-the-year-nominees-at-the-game-awards/2900-7266/" data-ref-id="2900-7266">The Game Awards</a> this year--tens of millions of votes in the first 24 hours alone. I know some of you have experienced errors and lag while voting, and I want to apologize," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that his teams have been "working around the clock" to help "improve the experience" for people looking to cast their vote online. Voting is open until December 10, so no one needs to rush to vote, Keighley reminded people.</p><p>"I'll keep you updated as we continue to improve performance. Thank you--from all of us--for your passion, patience, and support for TGA," he said.</p><p>Fan-voting makes up 10% of the vote for each category at The Game Awards, with the other 90% coming down to The Game Awards jury.

Now, EA's military shooter will seemingly no longer count the bots you kill in a match, but if you get blasted by a bot, that death will still show up in your stats sheet for now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1990889499979632848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 18 X post</a> by the community news source Battlefield Bulletin, the update was deployed to make the game's stats accurate and fair. If you visit your profile page now, you may see a significant drop in your kill-death ratio, possibly suggesting that many of the kills in that stat were merely on bots.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Retired competitive pro player Otto "ottr" Boström <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1990809560110584184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlighted this change on his X account</a>, posting a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be his Battlefield 6 profile page on November 18. In one image, he had 88,838 kills, with a 92.950 average K/D. In the subsequent image, his kills dropped to 24,227, with his K/D falling to 3.814. Boström believes this will "expose a lot of players out there."</p><p>While bot kills seem to mean nothing to your overall kills now, Battlefield YouTuber DannyonPC <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1990891124697727425" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned in Battlefield Bulletin's replies</a> that bot deaths--that is, you getting murked by a bot--still count toward your overall deaths. Battlefield Bulletin noted this, saying that it should be addressed "eventually" as well.</p><p>Battlefield Studios hasn't commented on the change yet, but its communications department did <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take to X on November 19 to post about other adjustments</a> it recently made to the game. This includes increasing the effective hitboxes of defibrillators, bumping the AFK kick timer in Sabotage from 60 seconds to 180 seconds, temporarily disabling bot backfilling in Sabotage, and clarifying Assignment and Challenge descriptions and criteria to make them easier to achieve and obtain.</p><p>All of these fixes appear to be Battlefield Studios' attempts at curbing bot farming. Since its October 10 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">rampant use of bots as XP cattle</a>. An October 21 update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-bot-xp-farms-are-no-more/1100-6535606/" data-ref-id="1100-6535606">dropped a grenade on these farms</a>, with a hotfix the following day <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-battlefield-6-update-aims-to-shoot-down-bot-filled-matches/1100-6535629/" data-ref-id="1100-6535629">reducing bots from filling matches</a>. Despite the gates limiting them, lead producer David Sirland explained on November 5 that bots play a crucial role: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/without-battlefield-6-bots-youd-be-waiting-a-lot-longer-producer-says/1100-6535956/" data-ref-id="1100-6535956">They help get games going</a>. And with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">a new Casual Breakthrough mode</a> that introduces a more relaxed way to play Battlefield 6, it's safe to assume they aren't going anywhere.

Dubbed Update 1.1.2.0, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">the patch substantially alters aim-assist</a>, making it "feel smoother and more predictable."</p>
