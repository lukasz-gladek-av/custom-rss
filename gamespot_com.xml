                <p>Evidence of a remake or remaster of the fan-favorite Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is solidifying, with a listing from European content-rating board PEGI emerging.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI listing</a>, the re-release of the Ubisoft classic is titled Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced, and it unsurprisingly has an 18 adults-only rating for violence, language, and in-game purchases. Ratings are generally a sign that a title's release is imminent.</p><p>"Resynced" is an amusing subtitle for a re-release, most likely referring to the in-universe Animus virtual reality machine that lets the player character experience historical events through an avatar, "syncing" them with memories of someone else from that time period. If you really want to make a stretch, "Resynced" could be a nautical pun.</p><p>The existence of this Black Flag revisit has been an open secret in the industry for years, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/" data-ref-id="1100-6515623">leaks dating back to 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-hints-at-a-potential-black-flag-remake/1100-6532817/" data-ref-id="1100-6532817">voice actors hinting</a> about the project. Per reports as recent as this November, the Black Flag remake <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-may-reportedly-launch-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6536439/" data-ref-id="1100-6536439">may launch on the week of March 23, 2026</a>.</p><p>Still unclear is if Black Flag Resynced is a straight remaster, similar to the treatment the Ezio trilogy and Assassin's Creed III received (with the latter simply titled "Assassin's Creed III Remastered"). "Resynced" could imply new or changed content for Black Flag--it's already been reported that this re-release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">won't feature any modern-day sections</a>, which would be a major change from the original game.</p><p>Should Black Flag Resynced surface in early 2026, it will be a nice drop for Assassin's Creed fans, who recently learned that the latest title in the franchise, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">won't get a second major DLC</a>.</p>
