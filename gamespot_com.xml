                <p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-forza-horizon-6-leak-suggests-were-racing-in-japan/1100-6534178/" data-ref-id="1100-6534178">rumored earlier this year</a>, developers Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are bringing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-6/" data-ref-id="5000-696409">Forza Horizon 6</a> to Japan. While the announcement trailer didn't show off much <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-races-into-japan-in-official-teaser-trailer/1100-6535010/" data-ref-id="1100-6535010">beyond Mount Fuji in the background</a>, Xbox Game Studios spared no expense to help the devs understand Japanese culture for the game. That included hiring a cultural consultant to guide them throughout development.</p><p>On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, cultural consultant, Kyoko Yamashita explained why the Forza Horizon 6 team felt the need to have a deeper knowledge about Japan while recreating it for the game.</p><p>"Japan is widely loved, but it can also be widely misread when you only see it from afar," said Yamashita. "The team wanted to present more than a postcard or a backdrop; they wanted a lived-in world. Having a cultural consultant early helps you make a thousand small, respectful decisions: how neighborhoods sound, even what a sign color communicates about a shop. Those small choices add up to credibility and help avoid stereotypes, while also making it a truly immersive experience for players."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXedKqX5Wa4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VXedKqX5Wa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yamashita added that the approach to authenticity was treated "as a practice, not a checkbox," and noted that it extended to the game's seasonal changes as well as the day-and-night cycles. Forza Horizon 6's Japan won't be a one-to-one recreation of the entire country, but it's meant to feel familiar for locals and visitors alike. That includes the way it incorporates Japan's car culture.</p><p>"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing," noted Yamashita. "Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, driftingâ€™s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It's welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel."</p><p>Forza Horizon 6 will be released in 2026 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. There is a PS5 port in development, but it will be a post-launch release.

Now, in response to the backlash, the team has apologized, reverting the price to its original amount after admitting it "messed up."</p><p>Starbreeze's head of commercial, Gustav Nisser, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told PC Gamer</a> that the Infamous Collection's 44% jump was not tied to the introduction of the new Payday 2: Subscription, a $5/month program that gives you access to a plethora of the game's DLC packs. While fans reportedly thought that the Infamous Collection's price hike was in some way a funnel toward the Subscription service, Nisser said it was all just really bad timing.</p>

<p>"If we had realized the change would be happening so close to the subscription launch, we wouldn't have done it," Nisser said. "In addition, we always aim to communicate upcoming price changes to our community and in this case we missed doing that as well. So basically we messed up in a couple of different ways, particularly both internal coordination and community communication and ... the results speak for themselves. The community has been pretty clear that they felt it looked like we were trying to push people into the subscription, and I completely understand that. For better or worse that's not the case, literally just a mishap."</p><p>To do good by the game's ardent fanbase, Starbreeze has not only apologized but also completely reversed course. The Infamous Collection is back to its original $118 price, with an additional 31% off on top of that, bringing the bundle down to $84.92 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/34119/PAYDAY_2_Infamous_Collection/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>).</p><p>"The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch--and they're not wrong, it's terrible timing," Nisser said. "We definitely didn't handle this right, and we'll be apologising to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake."</p><p>Both the Infamous Collection and the Subscription program are strictly for Payday 2, not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/payday-3/" data-ref-id="5000-455016">Payday 3</a>. That's seemingly because, according to SteamDB data, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 3 doesn't tend to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a> while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 2 frequently has tens of thousands playing</a> at any given time. The former is clearly more popular than the latter.</p><p>The Infamous Collection (only available for the PC version of the game right now) features over 70 pieces of DLC, including various cosmetics, weapons, characters, and more. You don't have to spend $118 (or $84.92) for any of these packs, though, as they're all available piecemeal and currently discounted on Steam.</p>

This includes the "Insanely Jacked" jack-o'-lantern-themed skin for Ajax and the "Witch's Holiday" skin for Seraph.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_events">New events</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="A_WWE_crossover">A WWE crossover</h3><p dir="ltr">A WWE-themed event will task players with completing various tasks to earn Entry Tickets. Players can use those Entry Tickets to complete minigames, and the games then reward Smackdown Points used to unlock new items. This includes the "Furious Finisher" weapon blueprint for the CR-56 AMAX and the "Fractured Fiend" operator skin for Minotaur.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also potentially earn WWE operator skins for Alexa Bliss and Undertaker as part of the WWE Draws.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Rock_Rampage_event">Rock Rampage event</h3><p dir="ltr">The Rock Rampage event tasks players with collecting Power Chords to unlock the legendary "Shredder" weapon blueprint for the FFAR assault rifle, as well as other cosmetic rewards.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Halloween_event">Halloween event</h3><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Call of Duty Mobile includes candy-collecting events. The details are scarce, but Activision says two new events will arrive just before Halloween.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574965"></a><figcaption>WWE skins in Call of Duty Mobile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Multiplayer_content">Multiplayer content</h2><p dir="ltr">Step Into the Ring is a limited-time multiplayer mode.
