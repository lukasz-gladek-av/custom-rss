                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> quests can sometimes get pretty complicated, demanding you venture across multiple maps to complete various objectives. A Bad Feeling isn't one of these, though, as it asks something quite simple of you: Just open an Arc Probe or Arc Courier. But where exactly will you find one of these, and what will you find inside? We're here to answer that for you, so read on for where to find Arc Probes and Arc Couriers.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Probes">Where to find Arc Probes</h2><p>You may occasionally see a fresh Arc Probe come in from the sky (keep an eye out for something that looks like a rocket coming down). These will be standing straight up once they land. However, these aren't likely to be the probes you normally come across, as most Arc Probes are found tipped over on their sides. In either case, you can hear Arc Probes from some distance--listen for their odd bleeps and bloops emitting every few seconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034"></a><figcaption>Arc Probe</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg"></figure><p>While they're found in randomized spots all across every map, Arc Probes are considerably more common during the <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong> map event. During the event, check the roof of the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map to score at least 2-3 of them in the same spot--which is a great way to start getting your points up if you're trying to knock out an Open Arc Probes weekly trial that may be active. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037"></a><figcaption>The Testing Annex roof is a great spot to find Arc Probes during an Electromagnetic Storm event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Alternatively, keep an eye out for the <strong>Prospecting Probes</strong> event to pop up when you're selecting a map to visit. Prospecting Probes pops up occasionally on each map except Stella Montis, and you'll be able to tell it's active by hovering over the map with your cursor. During this event, Arc Probes will be plentifully scattered across the map, so you certainly won't have any problems finding as many as you need.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085"></a><figcaption>A Prospecting Probes event will litter the map with Arc Probes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg"></figure><p>Arc Probes typically contain items like Arc Alloy, Arc Circuitry, and Arc Motion Cores--all of which are needed for crafting items. This makes Arc Probes worth popping open if you're invested in crafting much of your loadout--though you'll likely find the loot inside fairly insignificant otherwise. </p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Couriers">Where to find Arc Couriers</h2><p>Like Arc Probes, Arc Couriers can be found in random spots all across the map and similarly emit a black smoke. And also, just like Arc Probes, these are usually easier to find during the Electromagnetic Storm map condition. While the spawn locations vary, we've had a lot of luck finding Arc Couriers in the Red Lakes on the eastern side of Dam Battlegrounds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036"></a><figcaption>Red Lakes is often a good spot to find Arc Couriers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg"></figure><p>Arc Couriers can often house some important materials you'll need for progression, too. Specifically, keep an eye out for <strong>Surveyor Vaults and Sentinel Firing Cores</strong> when opening these, as you'll need them to craft some of your workbenches. Since the only other way to get these items is killing Surveyors or Sentinels--both of which are in very limited supply on each map--popping open Arc Couriers may turn out to be a quicker method than farming the enemies themselves. </p><p>In both cases, sometimes breaching these containers spawns a sudden drop of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-all-enemies-and-how-to-kill-them/1100-6536073/" data-ref-id="1100-6536073">Arc enemies</a> such as hornets and wasps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033"></a><figcaption>Arc Courier</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you've looted an Arc Probe or Arc Courier, you'll be able to turn in the A Bad Feeling quest back in Speranza. But finding one of these drops is just the beginning of your journey topside.

                <p>Quests in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> most frequently require you to visit only one map, but you'll occasionally encounter some that send you across multiple maps to complete them. One of these quests is Back on Top, which asks you to visit all four launch maps and mark specific buildings. It's not a particularly challenging quest, but it can be rather time consuming due to the amount of travel time needed to reach each building on the maps. As such, we've compiled the locations of all four buildings you need to mark. When you're ready to get this quest underway, follow the steps below.</p><h2 id="Mark_the_Pattern_House">Mark the Pattern House</h2><p>The Pattern House is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Head to the wall right beside the entrance and mark it to finish this portion of this quest.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631025-2.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631026-1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631025,1300-4631026" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631025-2.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631026-1.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631025-2.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631026-1.jpeg"></figure><p>This area is generally safe, but you should probably still keep your gun in hand if you plan to meander around inside and loot after marking it.</p><h2 id="Mark_the_white_lookout_tower">Mark the white lookout tower</h2><p>The white lookout tower is located around the center of the Blue Gate map. Approach it and tag the wall to finish up this part of the quest.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631027-share_20260107_1222160.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631028-share_20260106_1104380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631027,1300-4631028" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631027-share_20260107_1222160.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631028-share_20260106_1104380.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631027-share_20260107_1222160.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631028-share_20260106_1104380.jpeg"></figure><p>Due to its proximity to the Overlook Airshaft extraction point and Checkpoint POI, you may run into some folks in the area, so be prepared for a fight if your lobbies tend to be aggressive.</p><h2 id="Mark_the_South_Trench_Tower">Mark the South Trench Tower</h2><p>The South Trench Tower is located in the northern section of the Spaceport map. Walk up to it and mark one of the supporting walls at the bottom to complete this section of the quest.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631022-share_20260106_1105110.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631023-share_20260106_1104413.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631022,1300-4631023" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631022-share_20260106_1105110.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4631023-share_20260106_1104413.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631022-share_20260106_1105110.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631023-share_20260106_1104413.jpeg"></figure><p>This tower, as well as the North Trench Tower directly across from it, require keycards to enter.

But hey, if they do, just finish it for them and take some loot for your troubles.</p><p>Once all four buildings have been marked, you'll be able to return to Speranza and turn this quest in.

                <p>Some collectors will stop at nothing to complete their collections, even if that means decades have to pass before ever finishing. One such collector was on such a journey, finding and acquiring every Xbox 360 game released, and at the start of this year, that collector has finally finished this now vintage library that totals around $20,000--with the last game being a gift from their son.</p><p>Redditor uncleseeth <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q2gdxs/comment/nxcufdh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their massive library</a> in a post on the r/gaming subreddit on January 2. Starting the collection after receiving their Xbox 360 and Neversoft's Western shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gun/" data-ref-id="5000-21435">Gun</a> on Christmas Day in 2005, uncleseeth then went on a mad hunt for every single game ever released on Microsoft's seventh-generation console. From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a "complete set," which doesn't include the variants of various games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Best Games You Missed In 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Some games and items were given as gifts, including Efecto Studios' racer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-chavo-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-245779">El Chavo Kart</a> and the Xbox stand. One game that shocked them to find was The Farm 51's action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadfall-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-172682">Deadfall Adventures</a>, which they described as "kinda [having] Indiana Jones vibes."</p><p>But the final title they were missing was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2018/" data-ref-id="5000-464889">Pro Evolution Soccer 2018</a>, which was gifted to them by their son. With that in their possession, the collection was complete and totals roughly $20,000, as the games are estimated to resell for about $15 each after two decades. That said, there is one expensive game in the bunch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f1-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-187692">F1 2013</a>, which uncleseeth approximated is going for $250 or so.</p><p>With an Xbox 360 Elite--their first Xbox 360 got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the dreaded Red Ring of Death</a>--and a total gamerscore of 497,000, uncleseeth's next goal is to continue chasing more variants and play through the entire library. They said they've played about 800 of the games but only completed roughly 175 of them. That's a lot of games to play.</p>
