                <p>Pokemon Go is now owned by Scopely, which itself is owned by Saudi Arabia-owned Savvy Games. What's the day-to-day impact on Pokemon Go based on its new ownership? Not much, according to Pokemon Go's game director.</p><p>Michael Steranka told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he understands why people are skeptical. After all, there are countless examples of a new owner coming in and making major changes.</p><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka said. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that... I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless."</p><p>Niantic sold its games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion, and this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 most-expensive video game acquisition in history.</a></p><p>Steranka also clarified that the Pokemon Go development team will "pretty much never" engage directly with the bosses at Savvy. He said it's his understanding that Savvy allows Scopely to "operate the way they want to operate."</p><p>The director went on to say he's excited by the fact that Scopely is 100% a video game company, whereas Niantic had projects in the works across multiple content categories. "That's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he said. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><p>In terms of what fans can expect from Pokemon Go in the future under its new ownership, Steranka said the team plans to pull back from AR initiatives for the game. He said it's no secret that players "have not been super excited about some of the AR systems" in the game. In the future, Steranka said fans can only expect new AR features if it's something the team believes in fully and could be something "exciting."</p><p>"Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap," he said. "We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p>Scopely is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">working with The Witcher studio CD Projekt on a new game.</a></p>

A cinematic cut of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to debut at a film festival next month.</p><p>The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut will get its premiere screening on July 9 during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic. The announcement (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut-kviff-premiere-1236291931/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) doesn't say how long the cinematic cut will be, but it will follow the narrative of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who sets out to avenge his family and protect Sir Hans Capon during a diplomatic mission gone wrong.</p><p>Daniel Vávra and Petr Pekař are both credited as the director of the cinematic cut. Vávra wrote and directed both Kingdom Come games, while Pekar is Warhorse's cinematic director and led the team of animators who created five hours of cutscenes for the sequel. It's unclear if Warhorse Studios intends to screen the cinematic cut outside of the film festival, but CEO Martin Frývadlský expressed his eagerness to see the game's story get its due.</p><p>"I have wished to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on the big screen for a long time," said Frývadlský in a statement. "I believe that the civil story of a blacksmith’s son will also appeal to film audiences and stand up to the competition of international movie productions. Together with my colleagues in the studio, we are proud that we have the opportunity to present the story we have been working on for many years in a world premiere at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival."</p><p>PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers recently received the opportunity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-trial-experience-on-ps-plus-premium/1100-6531873/" data-ref-id="1100-6531873">play through the first few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> as a trial experience. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski also praised the game and noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-talks-kingdom-come-and-baldurs-gates-influence-on-the-witcher-4/1100-6532120/" data-ref-id="1100-6532120">that it influenced The Witcher 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is getting a <em>third</em> official Lego mode on Wednesday, in the form of Lego Fortnite <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Expeditions</a>, a four-player co-op mode that allows players to team up on a variety of action-adventure missions. For those Lego fans who have asked for a Lego Fortnite mode that recalls the many different story-based Lego adventure games, like Lego Star Wars, Expeditions is the one you've been waiting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOPVQSHIic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lego Fortnite Expeditions is the first official Lego mode in Epic's metaverse that doesn't involve building stuff--the purpose of this game is to battle enemies and solve puzzles alongside your friends. But don't worry--you won't be stuck using only the same sorts of weapons and items you can find in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, because Expeditions has character classes with unique abilities that you can upgrade as you complete missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the three classes–Hunter, Shadow Caller, and Rift Ripper--has its own unique main power and movement ability. The Rift Ripper, for example, can use rifts to get high ground or travel, or to drop crystal on the heads of baddies, while the Hunter can mark and make enemies more vulnerable to damage with its Bulls-eye Blade. If you wanna get weird, try out the Shadow Caller class, which can turn into a flock of ravens in an instant to escape any bad situation.</p><p dir="ltr">When Expeditions launches on Wednesday, it'll be accessible both as its own mode in the Discover page in the lobby, and by visiting a battle bus location in Lego Fortnite Odyssey or Lego Fortnite Brick Life. Odyssey, Lego's sandbox crafting mode, will also experience some bleedthrough from Expeditions, as new baddies introduced in the mode will start invading Odyssey islands in July sometime.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Expeditions is just one of several parts of the massive June 18 update, which almost feels big enough to be a new season update by this point. In addition to Expeditions, this update will begin a new season of Fortnite Festival with a brand-new headlining artist, launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-yet-another-new-battle-royale-mode/1100-6532468/" data-ref-id="1100-6532468">the new Blitz Royale mode</a>, and see Ballistic expand with another new map.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I was always a bit more of an outlier on the playground back in the day, preferring tales of destined children contending with trauma alongside digital monsters than everyday pre-teens leaving home to collect pocket monsters. Years later, Digimon still has my heart in a way Pokemon never will. The one area of the two respective franchises where I've enjoyed Pokemon more than Digimon is the video games. But I continue to hold out hope, dreaming of a Digimon video game that can rival how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/" data-ref-id="5000-35035">Pokemon Platinum</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-alpha-sapphire-omega-ruby/" data-ref-id="5000-272937">Omega Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus/" data-ref-id="5000-527659">Legends: Arceus</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Scarlet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> is that game. The latest in the Digimon Story series, you play as a secret agent in Tokyo, Japan who witnesses a city-leveling disaster and then suddenly travels eight years into the past. With your knowledge of what's to come, you have to investigate the mystery surrounding the coming disaster. Your actions twist the world and reshape history, plunging you and your allies through alternate timelines. Your investigation also leads into the Digital World, a parallel reality where Digimon live--you can befriend and train these digital monsters as partners to use while in conflict with Digimon that mean you harm.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRCH0qPHYzo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JRCH0qPHYzo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As you might have surmised given the name, the Digimon Story series has regularly told their stories very well--the focus of the series has been to submerge the player in narrative-rich experiences. Gameplay has been the part of this series that can be very hit-or-miss, and I'm not sure Time Stranger bucks that trend.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't get to play too much of Time Stranger at Summer Game Fest--about 20 minutes in total. After exploring a hub-like area and seeing various Digimon (including a fun Digimon Adventure 02 easter egg of Veemon, Hawkmon, Armadillomon, and Wormmon hanging out together), I played through two fights: a quick bout against a bunch of smaller Digimon, and then the first few turns of a boss battle against Parrotmon. Time Stranger's turn-based combat is built on a Rock, Paper, Scissors framework--certain digital monsters resist attacks of specific types, and are weak to other types.</p><p dir="ltr">Time Stranger uses the franchise's long-used Data, Vaccine, Virus format, in which Virus corrupts Data, Data rewrites Vaccine, and Vaccine cures Virus. A Digimon of a specific type tends to mostly learn moves of that type, but stronger ones can learn from at least two different types to help cover for weaknesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's pretty straightforward to pick up. Whenever a new Digimon shows up, there's some detective work needed on the player's part to figure out whether you're dealing with a Data, Vaccine, or Virus type, but simple experimentation with a variety of moves will reveal the result. It's not very hard, especially with only three options.</p><p dir="ltr">The potential issue I see is that, to make this dynamic more challenging, Time Stranger seems to have opted for making opponents have very large health bars. After playing through one round of combat against Parrotmon, I had deduced its type and which of my Digimon were best suited to fighting it--I switched out my Virus team members who would take extra damage from Parrotmon's Vaccine attacks, and directed my Data allies to leap into the fray. For the next three rounds, I pumped the same super-effective attacks into Parrotmon over and over. But even though my attacks were doing massive damage and Parrotmon's attacks were reduced to negligible numbers, I was only knocking off a tiny chunk of the boss's health bar each round. After the four rounds I played, Parrotmon still had over three-quarters of its health, and no new enemy had shown up, meaning the only thing left to do was keep clicking on my tried-and-true strategy for several more turns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278"></a><figcaption>The hub space in the Digital World is so cool!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Had I kept playing, I imagine the initial thrill of strategically reacting to Parrotmon's type and implementing a winning strategy would have dulled into tedium as I needed to keep chipping away at the giant parrot with the same moves over and over. There's no way to know for sure that would have happened, as my hands-on time with the demo ended there, and I didn't see what happened next, but that grind isn't appealing. It tries to create difficulty by making a boss fight longer than a traditional fight, not by making it more complex and incentivizing you to think about what move to use next.</p><p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing issue with Digimon games for years--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/digimon-survive-review-digital-devolution/1900-6417936/">I actually expressed similar complaints with Digimon Survive</a> back in 2022, which made fights "more difficult" by making each subsequent encounter last longer and longer. It did include one of the two non-standard Digimon types, Free, but that all-resistant type just made certain fights last even longer. I would have much preferred Variable/Hybrid boss battles--Digimon that change their type mid-fight, forcing an opponent to adjust their strategy on the fly. With that, Survive might have been more than another Digimon game with a great story and okay gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279"></a><figcaption>Digimon of many forms and levels can be recruited, even non-traditional options like BeelStarmon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much in the way Survive immediately pulled me in with its likable characters and kept wowing me with its timey-whimey narrative, what I've seen so far of Time Stranger's story is intriguing. Like past Digimon games, I think that's where the game is going to excel. I loved exploring the hub area in the early part of the demo and seeing Digimon use their traditionally violent powers for everyday tasks, like Zudomon wielding its lightning-generating hammer to build tools as a blacksmith. The culture of the Digital World has never been a huge part of any of the games or anime, so having a hub that delves into that sounds exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">I left the demo of Time Stranger once again wishing for a Digimon game that would just be a visual novel. That said, I feel like I haven't had a chance to give Time Stranger's combat a fair shake--I only played one minor fight and part of a single boss fight. I was told that the two fights I played will occur about midway through the story, so it stands to reason that they're a fairly accurate representation of what combat will be like throughout Time Stranger. But it was a demo, and other fights might be wildly different. Heck, if other fights at least see you face off against multiple Digimon of various types, I think the game could deliver a decently strategic gameplay experience. That's just not what I saw at Summer Game Fest.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't have long to wait and see what the final game will be like. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 3.</p>

Now, Hideo Kojima is joining the chorus. He said at a speaking event in Sydney, Australia recently that he's a big fan of the game and particularly its relatively small team size.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a small team at Sandfall Interactive, and Kojima said it was impressive to see the studio make the game with "like 33 team members and a dog," <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-ideal-for-one-key-reason-3215153/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reported</a>. It's not exactly true that the game was made by 33 people alone, as the core team at Sandfall was helped by dozens of other people. But in any event, Kojima said a small team size like Sandfall had for Expedition 33 is "ideal."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When I first started, it was like a team of six," Kojima said. "You could do everything yourself. Now, it's expanded. You can't really control each employee, so you delegate. But sometimes, the idea doesn't really work out because it's a bigger team."</p><p>Many modern games are developed by teams of hundreds of people, and this can feel like "factory" work, Kojima said. When teams get that big, they lose cohesion, Kojima said.</p><p>"Big companies, like 600, 1,000 people, they're full of totally different teams," he said. "Everyone's concentrating on their work and then combining together. Creation has now become much bigger. It's kind of a war between how efficient you could [be] with the small team, but you have to make it so grand."</p><p>Regarding Expedition 33's team size, Matthew Handrahan of publisher Kepler Interactive told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the "creative engine" of the game was about 30 people. He said it's true dozens of other people from places like Korea contributed to the game, but he said "none of them were full time." Then there was a "galaxy of partners" working on the game as well, including musicians, translators, testers, and more.</p><p>Handrahan said people get "fixated" on how many people worked on Expedition 33. That's actually missing the point, though, which he said was that Expedition 33 is not a "AAA" game and that becomes obvious when you look at the game's credits.</p><p>"Some games can make it work. Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to make it work, I think we can all say with great confidence. But there are plenty of games made with very large teams and for huge amounts of money that don't land, and there is a human cost to running things that way," he said. "People lose their jobs. God knows how many layoffs there's been in the industry over the last few years."</p><p>At Summer Game Fest recently, host Geoff Keighley praised Expedition 33 in part for how it was made by a team of "under 30 developers." Many quickly pointed out that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-geoff-keighley-clair-obscur-expedition-33-was-not-made-by-a-team-of-under-30-developers-and-devs-say-repeating-the-myth-is-a-dangerous-path/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this is a myth</a> and that saying this downplays the critical role that people outside of the "core" group had in the making of the game.</p><p>As for Kojima, his next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and it launches on June 26 for PS5. He has multiple other games in the works as well, including OD and Physint.</p>

<p>EA never confirmed a June announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>--only that the game would be revealed sometime this summer. Many assumed a reveal would happen in June alongside the video game industry's numerous other events, but it's unclear if June is when the unveiling will be.</p><p>The official last day of summer in the northern hemisphere is September 22, but no one is expecting EA to wait that long to reveal Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">Lots of gameplay footage and details about Battlefield 6</a> have emerged from Battlefield Labs testing program, but everything seen so far is a work-in-progress and non-final. The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>. That remains to be seen, however, and the company has said it's keen to avoid bringing the game to market too soon to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">help avoid having another Battlefield 2042 situation on its hands.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for the Battlefield Labs testing program</a> for a chance to try the game early. EA has said it's planning to expand the tests to more users over time, so if you didn't get in already, you might still have a chance for a future test.</p>
