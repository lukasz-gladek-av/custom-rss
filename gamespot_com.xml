                <p>In 2010, Visceral Games and Electronic Arts unleashed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dantes-inferno/" data-ref-id="5000-40808">Dante's Inferno</a>, an action-adventure game that was their answer to God of War. The story was very loosely inspired by Dante Alighieri's classic text, The Divine Comedy, as Dante sought to retrieve the soul of his wife, Beatrice, from Hell while facing Lucifer and the forces of evil. Now, 15 years after the game's release, new details have emerged about the canceled sequel, Dante's Inferno 2: Purgatorio.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> has an extensive report about Purgatorio, which includes a comprehensive breakdown of the story. The follow-up was envisioned as the inverse of the first game, as Dante was meant to scale Mount Purgatory to reunite with Beatrice and reach the Garden of Eden on top. However, each layer of the mountain represented one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and Dante had to both purge himself of those sins and defeat the embodiment of each one.</p><p>Dante also would have found himself in the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell, which he inadvertently set off by allowing Lucifer to escape Hell and invade Purgatory. St. Lucia--Dante's guardian angel from the first game's DLC--and the poet Virgil would have returned to guide Dante on his journey. To reach his goal, Dante would have to defeat some lethal archangels who considered him to be their enemy.</p><p>Along the way, Dante would have reunited and reconciled with Beatrice and banished her evil side from her. Or at least that's what he thought he did. In the game's closing moments, Dante and Beatrice made it all the way to Heaven, just for the former to discover that Lucifer had tricked him again. Through Beatrice, Lucifer murders Dante and casts him all the way back down to Hell. The only hope that ending offered is the spirit of St. Lucia, who assures Dante that even his death was part of God's plan.</p><p>The proposed third game, Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso, would have brought the war between Heaven and Hell to Earth and introduced Dante and Beatrice's daughter, who would be among the mortal warriors who fight alongside angels to reclaim Heaven from Lucifer and save Beatrice. God's plan would have been revealed as a plot to tear down the unforgiving ritual of sending souls to Heaven or Hell and replace it with something more compassionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, these ideas will likely never see the light of day as a game. But it's an intriguing look at what could have been.</p>

                <p>As part of Nintendo's<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> latest earnings report</a>, the company disclosed plans for the original Switch now that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-demand-has-exceeded-expectations-nintendo-apologizes-for-global-shortages/1100-6535958/" data-ref-id="1100-6535958">Switch 2 is in the market and putting up big sales numbers</a>. The original Switch will continue to be sold, Nintendo confirmed, but the company will focus on the Switch 2 going ahead.</p><p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware," Nintendo said.</p><p>In total, Nintendo has sold 154.01 million Switch consoles worldwide through September 30, and that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">just 10,000 units short of passing the DS</a> to become Nintendo's best-selling platform of all time.</p><p>The Switch is still millions of units short of catching up to the PS2, which is the best-selling console of all time with an estimated 160 million units sold. At least one expert believes the Switch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">will not catch the PS2.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and a variety of accessories</a> due in part to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo is predicting to sell fewer Switch consoles than before. For the current fiscal year, Nintendo is now expecting to sell 4 million units, down from a previous prediction of 4.5 million. However, Nintendo is revising Switch game sales up from 105 million to 125 million.</p><p>For the Switch 2, meanwhile, Nintendo is raising projections from 15 million to 19 million for the current fiscal year. The Switch 2 has sold more than 10 million units worldwide, making it the fastest-selling Nintendo platform ever over its first four months.</p>

This is a variant of Treyarch's iconic Nuketown map, which is reimagined with the aesthetics of a near-future design. Nuketown 2025 is not available at launch, but it will arrive before the start of Black Ops 7's first season of content.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 12 game modes confirmed for launch, and these are featured for the game's standard core and hardcore playlists. Many of the modes are Call of Duty staples, such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search and Destroy, and Hardpoint. However, Black Ops 7 does introduce the 20v20 objective-based Skirmish mode and the new Overload mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Overload is a 6v6 respawn mode that tasks teams with fighting to gain possession of an overload device. Overload begins with players rushing to grab the overload device. Once they have it, the team possessing it must protect the carrier as they attempt to bring it to a designated zone. Overload is a back-and-forth game of attack and defend, and this is also the new competitive game mode for the Call of Duty League.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All MP game modes at launch:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Overload</li><li dir="ltr">Team Deathmatch</li><li dir="ltr">Domination</li><li dir="ltr">Search and Destroy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Confirmed</li><li dir="ltr">Free-for-All</li><li dir="ltr">Hardpoint</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Order</li><li dir="ltr">Control</li><li dir="ltr">Face Off Moshpit</li><li dir="ltr">Skirmish (20v20)</li><li dir="ltr">Gunfight (2v2)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has 24 playable operators, but not all of them are available right away.

                <p>No one likes contaminated water, so it's best you fix things up when you find out the water supply is tainted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. The Source of the Contamination quest asks you to figure out what's causing the issue--and while it may seem pretty simple at a glance, it can be a little tricky to figure out the exact spot where things are going wrong with the water. Below, we'll fill you in on where to find the Flood Spill Intake on the Dam Battlegrounds map and how to solve this mystery.</p><p>Be aware that you don't need to extract with any items during this quest. Since you'll merely need to visit the location below and interact with an item, it's not a bad idea to handle things with a free loadout so you're not risking any of your hard-earned resources while exploring here.</p><h2>Where to find the Flood Spill Intake at the Water Treatment Center</h2><p>The Water Treatment Center is found just to the left of the middle of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a popular spot where a lot of raiders tend to visit to loot and fight, so it's probably best for you to approach it from the swamp if you're trying to keep things quiet. This is also a good call in general since the Flood Spill Intake is on the exterior of this POI.</p><p>The Flood Spill Intake is on the northern part of the Water Treatment Center facing toward the swamp. It's not too hard to spot as you approach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596618" data-ratio="0.56639427987743" data-width="1958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596618"></a><figcaption>Flood Spill Intake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596618-arcraiders_20251104234118.jpg"></figure><p>You'll know you've reached the right spot when you see concrete walls containing polluted water.

Interact with this suspicious object to defuse it. This completes the quest.</p><p>You can now leave the raid by using the Central Swamp Lift to the north. However, while you're here, it's a good time to peruse the various structures in the swamp for loot or check around for mushrooms, the latter of which can be found growing on trees all around this area.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> has <em>mostly </em>been a hit since its launch early in October, but chief among its players' concerns have been its arduous challenges. Fortunately, Battlefield Studios has been tracking the conversations regarding these tasks, as well as weapon- and mode-specific assignments, and is rolling out changes to streamline them.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Announced </a>on November 5, Battlefield 6 is receiving a significant overhaul to challenges, one which drastically shortens the vast majority of their requirements to "make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>As an example, Battlefield Studios cites how it has reduced the amount of required revives for a Support class challenge from 200 to 60. An example of of a streamlined weapon assignment showed that players would only need to inflict 3,000 damage as opposed to the previous requirement of 10,000 damage.</p><p>Additionally, mode-specific challenges have become more "standardized." Tasks that once needed five wins to accomplish them now only require two wins, and objective kills needed to complete a challenge have been similarly brought much lower than before.</p><p>These changes follow an update that increased experience points gained at the end of matches as well as lowered the threshold for early weapon-attachment ranks. Across the board, these tweaks should make it much easier for players to log in, play a handful of matches, and rank up much more efficiently in shorter play sessions.</p><p>Changes like these, including ones to the more advanced and intensive Expert and Master challenges, are currently rolling out and more are on the way, with details on the rollout to come.</p>
