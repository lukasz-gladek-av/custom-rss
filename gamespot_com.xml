                <p>Gadgets play a major role in whatever class you decide to use in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>. They're essentially the pieces of equipment that you spawn into every life with, and if you use them correctly, you can wreak havoc on the enemy team. Every class in Battlefield 6 offers several exclusive Gadgets for you to choose from, and while you can always stick with the default options, there are some better choices that are waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>Below, we'll go over the best Gadgets to use for the four classes in Battlefield 6 so you know exactly what to equip on your loadouts. It's worth noting that this guide pairs well with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-guns-and-weapon-loadouts-in-battlefield-6/2900-6870/" data-ref-id="2900-6870">best weapons in BF6</a> guide, naturally.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>With every class in Battlefield 6 allowing you to take two separate Gadgets, we'll be listing the top two Gadgets for each class. Some of them are unlocked by default, others are unlocked by leveling up, and some need to be unlocked through complex challenges. We made sure not to make the list consist only of gadgets you must sweat and grind for, though.</p><p>We'll go over each class and its best Gadgets below:</p><h3 id="Assault_class">Assault class</h3><p>First, we have Assault, one of the more popular classes in Battlefield 6. Assault doesn't have nearly the number of Gadgets as other classes do, but the options it does have can be game-wrecking. Here are our picks for the best Assault Gadgets:</p><ul><li>M87A1 Shotgun</li><li>Deploy Beacon</li><li>Assault Ladder</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146"></a><figcaption>The Deploy Beacon for the Assault class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png"></figure><p>While we did say that we'd only be listing two Gadgets per class, Assault is a special case. Its first Gadget slot is dedicated to actual weapons, including the all-powerful M87A1 shotgun, carbines, and other decent guns. So, to compensate for that, we're listing two other Gadgets you can use in the second slot.</p><p>The Gadgets we've gone with are the Deploy Beacon and the Assault Ladder. The Deploy Beacon is extremely useful for flanking enemies and squadding up with your teammates, while the Assault Ladder can be used for a variety of reasons, including forgoing the need for stairs to reach a second-level building.</p><h3 id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h3><p>Next up is Engineer, and it has access to some of the most varied and useful Gadgets in the entire game. As this class's goal is to take out vehicles, you'll find a slew of rocket launchers and other anti-vehicle equipment in the Gadgets section. Here's our picks for the best overall Engineer Gadgets:</p><ul><li>RPG-7V2</li><li>Supply Crate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151"></a><figcaption>The RPG-7V2 for the Engineer class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png"></figure><p>The RPG-7V2 is our choice for the best rocket launcher Gadget you can use for the Engineer class. The rockets are unguided and can be fired relatively fast, making them perfect for taking out ground vehicles quickly. You can also hit some incredible clips if you manage to destroy a helicopter or jet with an RPG shot.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the Supply Crate. Not only can this help solve the ammunition problem for your teammates in Battlefield 6, but it also allows you to constantly reload a vehicle's weapons without the need for the vehicle to visit a dedicated resupply station on the map.</p><h3 id="Support_class">Support class</h3><p>Support is far and away the most team-friendly class in Battlefield 6, and one of its Gadget slots is essentially filled before you even enter a match for the first time. If you've played Support, you know what Gadget we're talking about. As for the other slot, though, check out our pick for that Gadget below:</p><ul><li>Defibrillator</li><li>M320A1 SMK</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152"></a><figcaption>The Defibrillator for the Support class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png"></figure><p>The Defibrillator is basically a package deal with the Support class. It allows you to revive teammates instantly and can be used as a backup melee weapon if need be. You might as well not run Support if you're not going to use the Defibrillator.</p><p>The M320A1 SMK is our other Gadget pick for Support. This allows you to throw several smokescreens on the ground, allowing your team to reposition and not get picked off from a distance by snipers. You'll also clear any markers from enemies when you or a teammate runs into the smoke. This Gadget can replace a Smoke Grenade, but using the two together is even more powerful.</p><h3 id="Recon_class">Recon class</h3><p>Finally, there's the Recon class. This class is mostly reserved for sniper rifle players, as snipers are given massive advantages when running Recon. Whether you're using a sniper or not, though, you'll want these Gadgets on your loadout:</p><ul><li>Recon Drone</li><li>AP Mine</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153"></a><figcaption>The AP Mine for the Recon class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png"></figure><p>The Recon Drone might seem controversial for your first Gadget slot. While it won't impact your gameplay too much, it really helps out your team, as you can mark enemies continually as long as your drone doesn't get shot down. The Recon Drone also grants you incredible XP, which is hard to come by in Battlefield 6. If you're using a sniper, you can use the drone to scout out potential targets as well.</p><p>Our second pick is the AP Mine, which is basically a claymore that you can put down behind you as you set up in a cozy spot with your sniper or long-range weapon. As long as you place the mine in a hidden spot where enemies will run into it if they try to flank you, you're guaranteed a kill.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter set in an apocalyptic future. In this game, you strap on the boots of a scavenger who must collect valuable resources and gear from dangerous territory overrun with deadly robots and human threats. Like most extraction shooters, this game requires considerable risk to reap the best rewards. Our guide will provide you with some helpful tips for looting and staying alive in Arc Raiders.</p><p dir="ltr">Matches in Arc Raiders are called Raids, and they last for 30 minutes each. You can play solo or in a party of up to three players. You'll need to loot up and safely extract with your gear before the match ends in order to keep your stuff. If you’re eliminated or fail to extract, you'll lose everything on you--well, mostly everything, but we'll explain more on that below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</a><ul><li><a href="#Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</a></li><li><a href="#Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</a></li><li><a href="#Approach_extraction_with_caution">Approach extraction with caution</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</a></li><li><a href="#Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</a></li><li><a href="#Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</a></li><li><a href="#Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</a></li><li><a href="#Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</a></li><li><a href="#Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</a></li><li><a href="#Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_tips">Combat tips</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Base_tips_and_upgrades">Base tips and upgrades</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_Scrappy_often">Visit Scrappy often</a></li><li><a href="#Invest_in_the_right_skills">Invest in the right skills</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</h2><p dir="ltr">While these are great tips for all players, they are especially useful if you're planning on playing Arc Raiders solo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</h3><p dir="ltr">Every little sound you make is dangerous in Arc Raiders. Footsteps, looting containers, opening doors. Every action you take creates audio cues that can be used against you. Likewise, listening carefully can help you use the same audio cues against others.</p><p dir="ltr">Crouch to make less movement noise, move cover-to-cover, and use light shields when possible for faster movement. Popping a smoke grenade can also be a great stealth tactic for looting, healing, or escaping a fight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders The Queen enemy type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</h3><p dir="ltr">Some missions require you to fight Arc robot enemy types, but it's best to avoid them if you don't need to engage. You should choose gunfights wisely, as firing your weapon can alert nearby enemies to your location.</p><p dir="ltr">Check your surroundings and approach extraction points with caution. Sometimes players can be waiting to ambush others at the extraction points. Activating the lift at an extraction point also creates a lot of noise, so make sure you stay alert for potential enemies to arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</h2><p dir="ltr">You'll want to go topside with a clear goal in mind. Raids have a maximum timer of 30 minutes. If you need a specific item for a quest or an upgrade, make sure you check your map locations right away, so you know exactly where you need to go. Each main POI will tell you what types of loot are available there.</p><p dir="ltr">Example: If you need a mechanical part, hover over the POIs to see which specifies mechanical loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, watch the timer and give yourself enough time to get to an extraction point. Each extraction point has its own timer to indicate how long the point will be active. Don't wait too long and end up at one of the last points active, as other teams might be fighting you for that same extraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420"></a><figcaption>Fighting robots in Arc Radiers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</h3><p dir="ltr">What happens if you lose all your gear? Don't worry, Arc Raiders never leaves you completely empty-handed. You always have the option to start a match with a free loadout. This won't be a very good offering of gear, but you'll have a random weapon and some equipment to use for each match.</p><p dir="ltr">Using the free loadout is great when you're just getting started and don't want to risk much. It's also good for regaining and building up your inventory after some tough losses.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</h3><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, you want to plan out your objective before you start the raid. This also helps to make sure you bring the right weapon types for the job. Heavy weapons with bullet penetration are best for robots, while guns with light or medium ammo types are all you'll need for human threats.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll probably want to conserve the heavy ammo and weapons unless you know you're going topside to fight big robots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421"></a><figcaption>Weapon details and durability</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</h3><p dir="ltr">Weapons break in Arc Raiders. You'll want to be mindful of the durability of all your weapons. Highlight a weapon in your inventory to get its details and see what condition the item is in. You don't want to go into a fight with a gun that's on the verge of giving out on you. Make sure to make repairs when needed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</h3><p dir="ltr">Consider your playstyle when picking a shield for your loadout. Shields are categorized as either heavy, medium, or light. Heavy and medium shields mitigate more damage but slow you down, while light shields mitigate less but are lighter, and you can move faster.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that shields work differently from many other games. A shield doesn't completely block you from taking damage and instead only reduces how much damage you take. Each shield's description will detail the percentage of damage it will reduce, but it's important to remember that a shield won't save you in a fight if you're low on health. Always keep healing items available in case you take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434"></a><figcaption>Salvage items to free up your inventory</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</h3><p dir="ltr">At the start, you'll load into raids with 30 inventory spaces and one safe pocket slot, but you can get more space by equipping various bag types. Safe pocket slots are for your most important items. These are the <strong>only loot items you keep if you die</strong>. This is a good place to store high-value loot or quest items that you want to make sure you don't lose.</p><p dir="ltr">Your inventory will fill up really fast when looting, especially in the beginning, before you get a bag with extra space. This doesn't mean you should avoid or discard items you find. Try to hide and safely check your inventory while in the match to see if you're holding items that can be salvaged and into basic materials such as fabric and metal parts. These materials are highly stackable, and they can be salvaged mid-match to free up space.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, any required quest items you find are marked with a white diamond icon in the top left corner. This should help you better identify them, because these are items you'll want to hold on to.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</h3><p dir="ltr">When jumping or falling from heights, press the crouch button right before falling to perform a roll and protect yourself from fall damage. This won't work from really tall heights, but you can save yourself from reasonable heights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422"></a><figcaption>Destroy these sneaky alarms</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</h3><p dir="ltr">Keep an eye out for small red lights. They can be subtle, but you'll often notice a red light on a car or inside a doorway. These are alarms, and getting close will trigger a noisy sound that gives away your position. You can melee the light to destroy the alarm.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_tips">Combat tips</h3><p dir="ltr">There is an orange explosion and an audio cue when you break a player's shield. The killfeed will indicate with text to let you know you've knocked that player.</p><p dir="ltr">A knocked player sends up a flare. This can be seen by anyone in the area, so you don't want to linger too long, but listen for any approaching squadmates before finishing any kills and looting bodies. If they have teammates, they might be close. Knocked players also have a fair amount of health. Don't waste your ammo on them. Use your melee weapon to finish the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, flares can be tricky. Don't assume you're going towards a flare to third-party a fight or loot potential bodies.

There are ways to level up your character and experience while you are back home in your underground base inside Speranza.

<p dir="ltr">Season 1 also includes a surprising new vehicle for Battlefield 6.
