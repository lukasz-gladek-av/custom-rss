          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When I was first asked to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spine/" data-ref-id="5000-537140">Spine</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, I hadn't heard of it yet. I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/" rel="nofollow">looked it up on Steam</a> and thought it looked pretty rad, so I booked an appointment, though I also expected it would kick my butt. Sometimes that's the job, and that's okay. I compared it to Sifu in my mind, which I always found to be really difficult. However, once I got to go hands-on with it, I found it's more like a Batman Arkham game in terms of its combat gameplay. Those familiar mechanics helped me look stylish and deadly in my demo, and put Spine on my radar ahead of its launch next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes from Nekki, a team that has previously developed mobile games, including the popular Shadow Fight series. Even Spine originally began as a mobile game, but as the project grew and took on a different shape, the team realized it had an opportunity to make its debut on PC and consoles. Inspired by the career works of John Woo and other stylish action movies, Spine is a "gun-fu" combat game in a cyberpunk setting with a simple story setup.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl_9oQgLVLM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nl_9oQgLVLM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In it, you play as Redline, a character whose physical look is so cool in my opinion that it got me to book the demo. The punky street artist's origin story is much like John Wick's, though instead of a dead dog, it's her kidnapped brother who compels her to get into ass-kicking mode. The 15-20 hour game is said to start small in terms of Redline's motivation and increase the stakes from there. What she expects is a personal quest to save her brother soon pulls her into a criminal underworld of AI overlords and corrupt people in power across the colorful but troubled city.</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the game, I lit up bad guys in bars, hallways, and rooftops with roundhouse kicks, haymakers, and blasts of my dual-wielded pistols. The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve. This is a game from people who unabashedly love movies like The Matrix and Hard Boiled. Nekki isn't shying away from that, perhaps best displayed in its hallway fight scene reminiscent of Oldboy. It's leaning into it. But I was happy to see the game uses combat systems more like the Batman Arkham series, in which it's not too tough to chain together attack combos, execute well-timed counters to keep chains alive, and periodically switch to finishing moves performed by pressing a pair of face buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Redline was fierce and swift, taking down groups of four or more enemies at a time with regularity. I could also use a trigger button to spray-paint enemies huddled around me, much like Batman's cap stun attack. The paint would stick to the enemies and the environment, giving it a nice visual touch in which you literally left your mark on a brawl. I could shoot whenever I wanted to, but it's not a shooter. The guns were best used as combo finishers, which you can see stylish examples of in the trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game won't necessarily be "easy," it's not meant to send you beating your head into a wall. With people's busy schedules in mind, a developer told me the studio wants players to be able to play for just a short while and feel like they've made progress. If you come home from work and only have a little time to play games, you should be able to load up Spine, crack a few skulls, and feel like you've accomplished something in your short timeframe. And for players who do want more of a challenge, the game will offer a mode in which you have to avoid taking any damage <em>at all</em>. Good luck with that.</p><p dir="ltr">I liked Sifu, but more on the merits of its art direction, story, and, sure, how good the combat looked when I could pull it off. But Spine made me feel just as powerful without the accompanying frustrations, and personally, I'm way more up for that kind of experience. Whereas some games of this sort leave me feeling like a nameless goon at times, Spine made me feel like one of Keanu Reeves' punchiest roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>In 2018, as part of the promotion for Avengers: Infinity War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thanos-arrives-in-fortnite-for-avengers-infinity-w/1100-6458760/" data-ref-id="1100-6458760">Thanos was added to Fortnite</a>, complete with the Infinity Gauntlet and some dance moves that would make John Travolta blush. But it may not have ever happened if Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo hadn't directly lobbied Epic Games to bring Thanos into the world of Fortnite.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-a-nearly-six-hour-phone-call" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business Live</a>, Pete Wanat--the president of interactive technology for the Russos' AGBO--revealed that Epic's former chief creative officer, Donald Mustard, wasn't initially on board with having Thanos in Fortnite. That's why Anthony and Joe Russo spent hours convincing him go forward with it.</p><p>"Originally it was like, 'No, we are not interested in putting outside characters into Fortnite,'" recalled Wanat. "And Joe and Anthony got together and had a phone call with Donald. It was supposed to be a half-hour call, but five-and-a-half hours later, they were still talking about it. And Donald basically changed his mind. He said, 'Hey, you know what, we're going to do this.' And after that, the world exploded about what kind of integrations you could have between film and TV and games."</p><p>Mustard ultimately went on to work directly for the Russos at AGBO, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dancing-thanos-in-marvel-movies-is-better/1100-6458841/" data-ref-id="1100-6458841">dancing Thanos</a> became a meme that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-josh-brolin-responds-to-dancing-thanos-i-/1100-6458915/" data-ref-id="1100-6458915">confused his MCU actor</a>, Josh Brolin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FldbEoG6fpo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FldbEoG6fpo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once Thanos paved the way for outside characters to appear in Fortnite, it opened the floodgates. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fortnite-john-wick-skin-and-event-leak-in-seas/1100-6466767/" data-ref-id="1100-6466767">John Wick</a> skin followed the next year, and the trend continued this year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">a Darth Vader who can speak with the AI-generated voice</a> of the late James Earl Jones.</p><p>Starting Friday, June 13, Hank Hill from King of the Hill, Cleveland Brown from Family Guy, and Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers will all be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-some-famous-cartoon-dad-skins-for-fathers-day/1100-6532364/" data-ref-id="1100-6532364">added to Fortnite for Father's Day</a>.</p>

                <p>Charles Martinet--once the voice actor for one of gaming's most iconic characters and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/" data-ref-id="1100-6517020">Nintendo's official Mario Ambassador</a>--has had to clarify his stance on voicing Mario for fans. After a viral post claimed Martinet was no longer allowed to do Mario's voice, Martinet posted to explain that he simply won't improvise lines for Mario.</p><p>After meeting with Martinet at a convention, YouTuber Ricky Berwick <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1931740018596585814" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted to X</a> claiming the actor "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices." In the replies, another user <a href="https://x.com/MEBJR1001/status/1931859944938078582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a similar story claiming Martinet couldn't do the voice because he was "under a contract." Berwick later clarified in a reply to his original post that Martinet did the Mario voice for him off camera, but "wasn't allowed to" on video.</p><p>While fans were concerned about the possibility of a restrictive contract with Nintendo, Martinet replied to the post directly, explaining that what he will and won't voice for fans at conventions is due to his own choices.</p><p>"I do the voice for every fan I meet," Martinet promised in a reply. "I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That's my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character."</p><p>Martinet first voiced Mario for 1996's Super Mario 64, and has reprised his role for countless games since. Martinet was replaced as the character's voice actor as of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder/" data-ref-id="5000-591688">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, but has been given the official--if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-has-no-idea-what-a-mario-ambassador-does/1100-6517466/" data-ref-id="1100-6517466">somewhat vague</a>--title of Mario Ambassador. The role of Mario has now been taken up by voice actor Kevin Afghani, and Nintendo didn't make a big fuss about the recasting--telling fans they could find out who the new actor was in the end credits for the game.</p>
