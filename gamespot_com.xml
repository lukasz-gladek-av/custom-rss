                <p>The next Hearthstone expansion is Into the Emerald Dream, exploring the magical spirit realm specialized by Druids. As you might expect, this is a very Druid-focused expansion, and for the first time each class will get its own cards that use the Druid's "Choose One" keyword, alongside a number of other new mechanics. Naturally, Druids will get their own special tools, as we can exclusively reveal the new class <strong>legendary minion Hamuul Runetotem</strong> and several of his support cards.</p><p>Hamuul Runetotem himself uses the new keyword <strong>Imbue</strong>, which will be available to Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, and Shaman. This keyword gives you a new Hero Power, which then upgrades as you play more Imbue cards. Some already-revealed Imbue cards take effect as Battlecry or Deathrattle effects, but Hamuul's takes effect as soon as the game starts, if you built your deck with only Nature spells. Then, it repeats the Imbue effect again for every two spells you cast during the game. It's a big, powerful effect as a trade-off for limiting your spell selection.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png" data-ref-id="1300-4448995,1300-4448996" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>The Hamuul Runetotem Druid Legendary, in Standard and Signature variants</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448995-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4448996-druid_edr_845_enus_hamuulrunetotem-114858_signature.png"></figure><p>Druid's upgraded Hero Power summons a 1/1 Plant Golem, but keep in mind, it will be upgrading each time you play two Nature spells, to a 2/2 Plant Golem, and then 3/3 and so on.

It has both a Battlecry and Deathrattle that makes your next Hero Power cost 0. Assuming you've imbued a few times by the time you play it, this 3-mana 3/3 minion essentially comes with two more big minions for free.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449039" data-ratio="1" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449039"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449039-druid_edr_847_enus_dreambounddisciple-114912_normal.png"></figure><p>But of course, the big effect wouldn't mean much without spell support to build up your new hero power, and fortunately, Druid is getting plenty of that too. The <strong>Horn of Plenty</strong> is a Nature spell that discovers another Nature spell, making it enough for a full Imbue all by itself. <strong>Reforestation</strong> is similarly generous, letting you choose between drawing a spell or minion, or rewarding your patience by doing both if you hold it for three turns. Finally, <strong>Photosynthesis</strong> will help you stay alive by restoring 6 health, while also supplying you with three random Druid spells. The generated spells aren't necessarily Nature spells, but since they're Druid spells, they have a pretty good chance to help feed your Imbue effect.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449918,1300-4449919,1300-4449920,1300-4449921,1300-4449922,1300-4449923" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449918-druid_edr_270_enus_hornofplenty-115080_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449919-druid_edr_843_enus_reforestation-114848_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449920-druid_edr_843a_enus_aidoftheforest-115932_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449921-druid_edr_843b_enus_fertilize-115933_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449922-druid_edr_843t1_enus_reforestation-117402_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4449923-druid_edr_848_enus_photosynthesis-114914_normal.png"></figure><p>For the Into the Emerald Dream expansion, each class gets its own Wild God legendary card, along with its own Choose One card for the Druid flavor.

You can log in now to claim a legendary Ysera, Emerald Aspect card, and two free Creature of Madness cards from the shop. Each of those can be used ahead of the official launch. A pre-purchase bundle is also available now, which includes 60 Emerald Dream packs, two legendary cards, and a Ysera card back, for $50. A mega bundle includes 80 packs, 10 golden packs, a signature Malorne the Waywatcher card, one random golden legendary card, four Tavern tickets, the Ysera card back, and a Druid hero skin for $80.</p>
