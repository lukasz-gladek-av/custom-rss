                <p>While getting review-bombed likely felt terrible at the time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has apparently reached the point where it can laugh about the situation. After a long wait, it has finally sent all players a free in-game cape to commemorate the time when the community turned <em>hard</em> against the otherwise very popular game.</p><p>In what might be a first, the cape literally depicts a frequency graph of postive vs. negative reviews during the review-bombing campaign. If you squint at the image in the embed below, you can see that there are small light blue bars at the top of the cape; these are the bars for positive reviews, which are clearly and massively outweighed by the red bars representing the negative reviews. While it was announced <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801636341362393548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">over a year ago</a>, the cape is finally out and available for free for all Helldivers 2 players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED<br>In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape. The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armories as soon as the rollout is complete. <br>This… <a href="https://t.co/DOWaFHU40N" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/DOWaFHU40N</a></p>  — HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>If you don't quite remember why so many people were furious at Arrowhead (for about a week), it all had to do with issues caused by the interactions between publisher Sony, Arrowhead, and the PC version of the game. In essence, not long after the game launched in early 2024, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">attempted to require that PC players create or link a PlayStation Network account</a> to keep playing. As the PC gaming culture tends to look unfavorably on efforts to mandate new accounts or launchers, players were outraged and eventually managed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">to convince Sony and Arrowhead to reverse course</a>.</p><p>This decision caused an intense, albeit short-lived, downturn in Helldivers 2's otherwise stellar reviews, driven by coordinated review-bombing. Following the reversal, players banded together to try to do a review-boosting campaign, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's recent Steam reviews have fully recovered</a>. But the outrage and temporary cratering of the game's reputation seem to have left a strong impression on the developer.</p><p>Arrowhead has had to work hard to build back toward the heady heights of its early days, though. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-sees-players-returning-in-droves/1100-6531700/" data-ref-id="1100-6531700">Recent content updates have been received quite well</a>, with peak concurrent players reaching close to 200,000 last month. Having <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hit a low point back in April</a>, Helldivers 2 has been reinvigorated by the Heart of Democracy update.</p>

Now, a fan has released a new Oblivion Remastered mod that gives players a Glock they use to shoot up Cyrodiil's creatures. You can see it in action in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CRpe6UlEE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b9CRpe6UlEE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A user going by CosmicBoogaloo posted the Oblivion Remastered Glock mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, and humorously added, "Mehrunes Dagon owes me some money and I'm gonna get it one way or another."</p><p>CosmicBoogaloo went on to explain that the mod was created by making changes to the game's archery system to mold the shape of the weapon. But it took a second mod--Dicene's <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SlickArchery</a>--to reproduce the rapid fire of a gun. From there, bullets were swapped in for arrows, gun sound effects were added, and there's even a holster for the gun.</p><p>To use the Glock mod, players will have to download a few additional mods including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS for ObRem</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UE4SS TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Runtime EditorIDs</a>. CosmicBoogaloo also recommends adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NL_Tag Remover</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3098" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Auto-Hide Gear</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dicene/OblivionMods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Returning Arrows</a> for a smoother experience. For the future, CosmicBoogaloo notes that "more NPC gun replacements are planned," which presumably means they'll be packing heat as well.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">first update for Oblivion Remastered</a> arrived earlier this month, and fixed a number of issues with the game. So far, Oblivion Remastered is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the third-highest-selling game in the US</a> of 2025, with only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> ahead of it as the No. 1 and No. 2 games, respectively. The response to Oblivion Remastered has been so positive that even Skyrim Grandma, aka Shirley Curry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-grandma-ends-streaming-retirement-to-play-oblivion-remastered/1100-6531994/" data-ref-id="1100-6531994">came out of her streaming retirement</a> to play the game.</p>

Conceived by visionary psychologist Mark Tyburn, Daisy's Ark was eventually canceled following a pattern of "unexpected and disturbing results." A decade later, the project is unearthed and development resumes.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, the book is adapted from the narrative audio series of the same name. The series debuted last June and ran for 12 episodes. Each episode features an ensemble cast of performers, including The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln, Shamier Anderson, and Paterson Joseph. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/A-Better-Paradise/dp/B0D487TCVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listen to the audio series for free</a> on podcast services.</p><p>The novel version of A Better Paradise expands the narrative by providing more background on the early days of Tyburn Industria's video game project and the people who made it.</p><p>As the title suggests, this is the first novel in a series by Houser. It's unclear how many volumes are planned, but we do know A Better Paradise will eventually be home to a real video game. The first game set in A Better Paradise's universe is in development at Absurd Ventures.</p><hr><h3>Novels about video games and game studios:</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489" data-ratio="0.50909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4523489"></a><figcaption>Novels about video games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4523489-tomorrowandtomorrowandtomorrow.png"></figure><p>If you're interested in reading more fiction centered around games and the people who make them, check out the list of novels below.

                <p>We finally know what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a> looks like. On the heels of several extensive written overviews of the game's changes and additions, EA Sports has published a first look at CFB 26's gameplay.</p><p>In a new 17-minute video, EA gives an overview of some of the core mechanics updates that are coming to CFB 26. Among the highlights is a discussion of dynamic substitution, which allows you to substitute players on the fly, providing more flexibility in between plays and reducing the need to go into main menus. On defense, you can also now adjust safety alignments right before the snap, providing the ability to temporarily change to more of a "prevent" defense (to take away deep passes) or play more aggressively, closer to the line of scrimmage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua9AZ66C1tQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ua9AZ66C1tQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>EA also provides more depth about how it is overhauling quarterback play from last year's game. The developer is emphasizing more realism and accuracy in how it represents different throwing motions; as many quarterbacks have quite distinctive mechanics in the real world, EA explains that enhancing the accuracy was crucial in improving the game's presentation. Additionally, quarterback height is now taken into account; shorter quarterbacks will need to more carefully throw through lanes, while taller quarterbacks can more safely throw over the top of linemen.</p><p>Players who enjoy taking control of defense backs and playing in pass protection will notice some changes, as well. EA explains that there are refinements coming to the hit-stick options and animations for when defensive players are contesting catches in mid-air. In addition, defensive players will get worn down and lose effectiveness when they fail to successfully execute a hit-stick pass breakup.</p><p>There's a lot more detail contained in the video, which you can check out in the embed above. In addition to these gameplay mechanics, EA is also significantly expanding features related to school spirit and traditions. More schools will have their unique run-outs and band formations featured, there'll be a larger roster of mascots, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cfb-26-adds-the-internets-favorite-mascot-the-pop-tart/1100-6532658/" data-ref-id="1100-6532658">the Pop-Tart Bowl's edible mascot will even be included</a>.</p><p>CFB 26's release date is rapidly approaching; it comes out on July 10, but people who preorder special editions of the game can get access three days early. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorder-bonus-ps5-xbox-series-x-releases-july-10/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">Check out our preorder guide</a> for all the info on the different versions you can buy.</p>

<section><p>The new companion app for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom offers some helpful functions, but also diminishes the thrill of discovery.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has given a number of Switch 1 games some extensive upgrades on the Switch 2, but none more so than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Not only do both titles look and run much better on the new hardware, with crisper visuals and smoother frame rates, they can also sync up with a brand-new companion service called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-zelda-notes-app-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild/1100-6532180/">Zelda Notes</a>. But as novel as some of its features can be, the service often contradicts the games' most captivating qualities--their sense of discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">Accessed through the Nintendo Switch mobile app, Zelda Notes offers a suite of features to supplement your adventure in Hyrule. You can view detailed records of your own playthrough, including the number of enemies you've slain and materials you've collected, as well as global stats to see how you stack up with the wider player base. The service also has its own achievements system in the form of medals, which are awarded when you hit different milestones (such as using Zonai powers 1,000 times), along with a function to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/" data-ref-id="1100-6530614">share items</a> and autobuild designs with other players.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is neat, but inessential; you can play through either title without once consulting the app and your adventure would not feel any less fulfilling. However, one feature that does have an appreciable impact on the experience is Navigation. On top of being a repository of personal stats, Zelda Notes can effectively act as a GPS for your game, leading you to a specific point of interest or collectible. As you're exploring Hyrule, the service displays your current location on the map along with an extensive list of things to discover around the kingdom, from shrines and cave entrances to different treasures and enemies. Select a destination--such as a Korok you've yet to find--and the app will guide you there with audio directions, helping you mop up any collectibles you've missed or had trouble locating.</p><div

games – Nintendo Switch 2 Editions &amp; ZELDA NOTES – Overview Trailer</p><div><p>         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       </p><p><a

use Zelda Notes, especially for completionists. Both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are vast games, with an overwhelming number of shrines to activate and other secrets to discover, so having a means to track down any you've overlooked (without having to go through the inconvenience of Googling the solution) is a boon. And indeed, it works fairly well. Aside from the occasional syncing quirk, the feature is intuitive and simple to use, which makes it temptingly easy to fire up when you're, say, struggling to suss out where your shrine radar is trying to lead you. And yet, as I was testing out Navigation, I couldn't help but feel like I was cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of the appeal of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom stems from their freeform, open-ended structure; both are designed to continually stoke your curiosity, encouraging you to stray from your current objective with breathtaking landmarks and other enticing diversions. Exploration is very much a reward unto itself, and the most satisfying discoveries often occur when you indulge a whim and venture off the beaten path. In this respect, the entire purpose of the Navigation feature runs counter to what makes these games so special. Being able to pinpoint a shrine you've missed and simply follow directions there is convenient, but it undermines the sense of discovery that makes these games so enthralling.</p><p dir="ltr">What's more, both titles already offer in-game ways to track certain objects, which are better at preserving the spirit of adventure than Zelda Notes' Navigation feature. On top of the aforementioned shrine radar, there's the Korok mask, which will rattle when you're in the vicinity of a hidden Korok. Both of these do a fine job of nudging you in the right direction without overtly spoiling the solution, offering helpful guidance while still allowing you to feel the satisfaction of discovering things on your own. Navigation removes that entirely, which in turn diminishes the sense of accomplishment when you do finally locate the object you're seeking.</p><p dir="ltr">The same can also be said of the Daily Bonus feature. Once every 24 hours, Zelda Notes allows you to spin a roulette of perks that can be applied within the game. These range from buffs like a temporary boost to defense or speed (much as you would get from consuming a meal), to even the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-zelda-app-fixes-weapon-degradation-in-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530853/">repair a damaged weapon</a>. The latter is not as overpowered as it may initially sound; the odds of actually pulling it are fairly slim, and it's only good for one use. Still, its availability flies in the face of one of the games' core design elements. Controversial as it may be, weapon degradation is integrally woven into the fabric of the gameplay, reinforcing the need to continually poke around the world and gather whatever resources you happen upon. Having a means to repair a weapon, as limited as it is, circumvents this carefully designed system in a way that cheapens the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523473"></a><figcaption>Once a day, Zelda Notes lets you roll for a free perk you can activate in your game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4523473-img_6791.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To be fair, the available perks are hardly game-breaking. One seven-minute speed buff will make very little difference in the grand scheme of your adventure, and the fact that you can only spin the roulette once a day ensures these bonuses cannot be abused. It is, in effect, no different from obtaining meat and other materials by scanning an Amiibo figure--a small gift that amounts to little more than a minor convenience. Even so, when the systems underpinning the gameplay feed into each other as meticulously as they do in these two Zeldas, any free advantage--however slight--feels counterintuitive.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo had to tread a very fine line with Zelda Notes, designing a service that provides some helpful ancillary features that enrich the experience for core players, but can safely be ignored by those who wish to preserve the satisfaction of discovering things on their own. To that end, it achieves the intended results. Zelda Notes offers enough supplemental functions to make it a handy companion app, particularly for those who just want to check off any remaining collectibles and have no compunctions about spoiling their location. But when the games the service is tied to are so deliberately designed to foster ingenuity and inquisitiveness, it may be more fulfilling not to use it at all.</p><p dir="ltr">As I was scanning the map in Zelda Notes, I spotted a cluster of Koroks I'd yet to find not far off from my current location. It would have been very easy to navigate directly to each one and check them off my to-do list, but I decided to close the app, put on the Korok mask, and set off with no particular destination. And along the way, I stumbled upon a cave I'd never noticed before.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>, but what are they and when will we learn about them? It might not be a whole lot longer until Halo's future comes into focus. Halo Studios has announced that it will share more information about what's next for Halo at the Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo Studios said it's observed "a fair amount of speculation about when and where more details might emerge" about the next Halo projects currently underway. "We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the developer said.</p><p>It was at last year's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including Project Foundry. This was also when Microsoft announced that 343 Industries was rebranding as Halo Studios.</p><p>"For us, A New Dawn was just the beginning--at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation," the developer said. "Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The event takes place October 24-26 in Seattle.

                <p>The Animaniacs was the follow-up series to Tiny Toon Adventures and introduced young audiences to the Warner Bros. characters Wakko, Yakko, and their sister, Dot. The animated program was a huge hit, spawning merchandise, a movie, and nine video games--including the two spin-off games focused on Pinky and The Brain. Recently, however, a never-released tenth game has been unearthed, and it would have been released on Game Boy Advance.</p><p>The preservationist group <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hidden Palace</a> released information about the game, Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics, and even uploaded it so players can now play the long-lost game. You can watch some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6EQ4aeWY9M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Hello again! Presenting: A nearly complete build of Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics for the Game Boy Advance, a game that was thought to have been lost until now! <a href="https://t.co/5x4gHghzWU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/5x4gHghzWU</a></p>  — The Hidden Palace (@HiddenPalaceOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Like similar games from the franchise, the game sees players take control of the Warner siblings, facing off against the genetically enhanced lab mice Pinky and the Brain. The Brain wanted to take over the famous Warner Bros. Water Tower--and the Warners' lair--and turn it into a rocket. The title of the game came from the duo using hypnosis to put their plan into action.</p><p>The game was likely to be released in 2003 after what seems like an incredibly bumpy road to production. Initially starting as a project for the publisher Conspiracy Entertainment, it was eventually rebooted under another company named Swing Entertainment. It was put aside after Swing entered insolvency proceedings also in 2003, officially putting an end to the project.</p><p>Swing would eventually release Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2005--it would be one of the last Animaniacs games made.</p>
