                <p>Rockstar's 2010 game Red Dead Redemption has been rated for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently posted a rating</a> for the game on these platforms, and this has led some to believe a remaster of the game is in the works and that it could possibly launch soon. Nothing is confirmed, however.</p><p>This is all separate from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ongoing rumors of Red Dead Redemption II coming to Switch 2 and getting updated versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. The ESRB database has no rating for Red Dead Redemption II on those platforms, however.</p><p>The ESRB rating for Red Dead Redemption mentions zombies, which suggests the possible upcoming re-release could feature the game's popular Undead Nightmare expansion.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption came to the Switch in 2023 and PC in 2024, some 13 and 14 years after the game originally debuted on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. The follow-up--which is a prequel to the events of the first game--launched in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One and came to PC in 2019.</p><p>The rumored RDR2 ports for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S are said to be in the works for a 2025 release, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> could come out this year as well. Whether or not the rumored new versions of RDR and RDR2 could be packaged together is unknown.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two recently said it had eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028. These will be remasters and ports; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">only four have been confirmed so far</a>, and some are speculating that the possible re-releases of RDR and RDR2 could be among the announced projects.</p><p>As for Rockstar's biggest upcoming release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 has been delayed yet again</a> and is now set for release in November 2026.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced Horizon Steel Frontiers, a new game for mobile devices and PC under development at Guild Wars studio NCSoft. The new entry in the Horizon franchise is an MMORPG that looks heavily inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series--albeit with mechanical monsters instead of organic ones--and the PC version will be playable through NCSoft's Purple platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed in collaboration with Horizon studio Guerrilla Games, Horizon Steel Frontiers is set in the Deadlands. As a Machine Hunter, players will get to customize their character and embark on large-scale raids, utilizing an "advanced" combat system to secure resources. A release date has not been revealed yet, and the game isn't listed for PS5 or PS4--a first for the franchise considering its PlayStation roots.</p><p>Recently, Sony took Chinese conglomerate Tencent to court over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">Sony labeled as a "slavish clone" of the Horizon series</a>.</p><p>Since the first Horizon game launched in 2017, the series has steadily grown with expansions, a sequel, and spin-off games like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Lego Horizon Adventures. Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-sequel-in-development-guerrilla-confirms/1100-6513480/">Guerrilla confirmed that it was working on</a> "Aloy's next adventure" and the studio is also rumored to be developing a multiplayer game that will feature a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/">completely different art direction</a> when compared to the mainline games.</p><p>Outside of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a Horizon live-action movie is also in the works</a>, with filming expected to kick off in 2026.</p>

                <p>Five years into the PS5 lifecycle, Sony is confident that the best-selling game of all time for the system has yet to be released. In a new interview, PlayStation's senior VP of marketing, sales, and business operations, Eric Lempel, spoke about how the PS5 era has just started to find its feet, and he has an idea of what the console's biggest-selling game will be.</p><p>"I would say we're really hitting our stride now," Lempel said to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e352emrro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC News</a>. As for the game that will be the PS5's sales juggernaut? "I'm not going to tell you which one, but I think it's still to come," Lempel added.</p><p>In the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-ps5-games/2900-7249/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is currently the best-selling PS5 game</a>, with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in second place. Several more games are in development for the console, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>. While those games are expected to sell well, it's the upcoming release of GTA 6 that analysts are predicting will be a blockbuster of note. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">Even with it being delayed to November 2026</a>, hype for GTA 6 still remains off the charts. Its predecessor, GTA 5, is the second-best-selling game of all time--220 million units shipped as of November 2025--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/">and it'll be coming back to the PS Plus Game Catalog</a> later this month.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/">Lifetime sales of the PS5 have reached 84.2 million consoles sold so far</a>, and Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have only reached the halfway point of its lifespan. Sony's recent investors report also confirmed that Ghost of Yotei has sold 3.3 million copies since launch, but the company has taken a $204 million hit due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-takes-a-204-million-hit-as-destiny-2-falls-short-of-expectations/1100-6536124/">Destiny 2 falling short of sales expectations</a>.</p>
