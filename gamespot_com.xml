                <p dir="ltr">There could be an official Xbox-branded handheld out by the end of this year. A new report states that Microsoft is partnering with a PC gaming company, like ASUS or Lenovo, on the device, with a targeted launch in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="nofollow ">WindowsCentral</a>, the handheld is codenamed Keenan and will be similar in nature to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-windows-handheld-preorders-are-live-steamos-model-releases-in-may/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>--which will be the first device outside the Steam Deck family to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">run on Valve's SteamOS</a>. So, the Xbox-branded handheld will likely run on Windows, featuring the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. The report also states the system will likely sport an Xbox guide button and aesthetics that fit the Xbox ethos.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">Phil Spencer mentioned an Xbox handheld is a "few years out"</a> in November. (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-thinks-xbox-should-have-a-handheld/1100-6524107/">Spencer, for his part, has teased making an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, too.) This longer-term plan lines up with the report of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">the next Xbox launching in 2027</a>. Basically, Microsoft plans to kick off the next generation with a Xbox Series X successor accompanied by an internally developed handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr">However, unsurprisingly, it's noted that this schedule could shift as Microsoft works on the future of the Xbox brand. For instance, WindowsCentral points to the Xbox-licensed handheld scheduled for this year to serve as sort of a test drive for Microsoft. There is also no specific details on the partnering company, which could also be Razer or MSI.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted Microsoft seeking comment on this report.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/">a Call of Duty leaker claimed the next Xbox is planned for 2026</a>. One aspect that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">Spencer has touched on is that the next Xbox hardware must be more innovative</a>.</p>

                <p>Last week AMD launched FSR 4 alongside its first RDNA 4-equipped desktop GPUs. It's a drastic improvement over previous versions of the tech suite, introducing AI-powered upscaling that is only possible thanks to dedicated hardware on the new cards. It's an advancement that Sony's Mark Cerny is saying will come to PS5, albeit not until 2026.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>, Cerny was full of praise for AMD's FSR 4 release, saying that the upscaler surpasses the work Sony has done with its PS5 Pro-exclusive solution, PSSR. "And results are excellent, it's a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR," Cerny explained. "I'm very proud of the work of the joint team!"</p><p>Cerny says that FSR 4 will need to be backported to the PS5 Pro, essentially through a new version of PSSR that takes into account all the advancements AMD has made. Cerny says that for the most part the information the upscaler requires from a game will stay the same, which will make implementation by developers easier, but that it isn't as easy as supporting FSR 4 natively. This is due to the PS5 Pro having an entirely different architecture than RDNA 4, and thus not one that can support it fully like AMD's latest GPUs.</p><p>"RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in FSR 4," Cerny continued. "I'm definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability."</p><p>FSR 4 doesn't have the same performance gains as its previous iteration, in part due to the additional overhead required for the vastly improved results. Cerny, however, believes the PS5 Pro can still support these image improvements despite the much weaker hardware in the PS5 Pro, without requiring major re-architecture. "That is what we are targeting, and we believe we can achieve it," Cerny added.</p><p>Sony and AMD continue to collaborate on Project Amethyst, with its first major milestone coming with the release of PSSR. Cerny believes there's a lot more to come by working closely with AMD, especially when it comes to machine learning and ray tracing enhancements for future console hardware. "All I can say is stay tuned! There’s a lot of opportunity with our Amethyst collaboration, and we know that ray tracing is a huge part of the graphics future," concluded Cerny.</p>

Alongside a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-get-harder-next-season-with-both-a-difficulty-increase-and-xp-gain-decrease/1100-6530009/" data-ref-id="1100-6530009">slower pace, difficulty changes</a>, and class balance updates, the theme of Season 8 will revolve around a revamped endgame boss system that will make channeling them more straightforward and rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgzOVLtAWLI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kgzOVLtAWLI?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Three new endgame bosses in total will be added as part of Season 8: Urivar and the Harbinger of Hatred from Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred campaign, and a third that will be familiar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> players. That boss is none other than Belial, the Lord of Lies, who will serve as the game's new pinnacle boss. Players may remember him from his multi-phase Act-2 battle in Diablo 3, the final phase of which his massive form took up the majority of the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">"Belial is back in Sanctuary," Diablo 4 lead season designer Deric Nuñez said during the livestream. "He is climbing his way to the top of the lair boss ladder. He is the new exalted, pinnacle challenge within the ladder. He is the highest challenge, the highest reward."</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating the endgame bosses during Season 8 will unlock that boss' powers for players to use. There will be a total of 24 boss powers to collect and experiment with as part of Season 8, Blizzard said. There will additionally be a new boss-rush style open world event, Apparition Incursions, that players can take part in as part of the Season. Defeating and looting any endgame boss will have a small chance to initiate an ambush by Belial (in his smaller, less screen-covering form). If players can then take out Belial too, the loot rewards will double.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is really cool, because it's like a two-for-the-price-of-one payout," Nuñez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the new bosses and the ability to channel some of their iconic powers, Blizzard is vastly simplifying the boss summoning process. Currently, players collect a number of different items required to summon different bosses, resulting in inventory clutter and a constant state of having some items needed to summon a boss but not the others.</p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 8, that system will be done away with and replaced by a much simpler Lair Key system. Each endgame boss will require their own Lair Key, but those keys are only used to unlock their hoard of loot upon being defeated. Players will actually be able to challenge the endgame bosses at any time in order to see how their character stacks up and to practice and learn each bosses mechanics, without the risk of losing precious boss summoning materials as is currently the case.</p><p dir="ltr">The public test realm for Diablo 4 Season 8 will start on March 11. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-delayed-but-will-feature-return-of-an-old-friend/1100-6529803/" data-ref-id="1100-6529803">Season 8 proper, meanwhile, was recently delayed</a> and is expected to arrive April 29.</p>
