                <p>There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and even its signature shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo</a>, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">coming to PlayStation 5</a>. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.</p><p>Rhys Elliott's <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/octobers-top-playstation-games-by" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, "AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?"</p><p>Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6827">dominated the PlayStation sales charts</a> earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.</p><p>Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.</p><ol><li>Battlefield 6 - 3.2 million</li><li>EA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 million</li><li>Ghost of Yotei - 2.7 million</li><li>Minecraft - 635,000</li><li>NBA 2K26 - 564,000</li><li>EA FC 25 - 350,000</li><li>Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000</li><li>EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000</li><li>Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000</li></ol>

                <p>Roguelite is one of the hottest subgenres in gaming right now. From Balatro to Drop Duchy, developers have integrated cyclical mechanics into all sorts of other genres. Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.</p><p>Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.</p><p>Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLu87b8jN58" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MLu87b8jN58" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We don't have much to go on besides the reveal trailer, but the gameplay and visuals look polished enough to make Odds Chronicles stand out among a sea of other roguelites. The tactical roguelite will launch on Steam and Epic Games Store in 2026, with versions for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S arriving later.</p>

                <p>As you work your way through Tian Wen's questline in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll eventually begin a quest called Market Correction, which tasks you with finding and sabotaging a cache in the Buried City. This quest is relatively straightforward in execution, but finding the precise spot where the cache is located might prove a bit tricky--especially in the midst of chaotic battles with the ARC and other raiders who may be working on the same quest.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Market Correction, you can follow the steps below to round up the cache at Marano Station and be one step closer to finishing up Tian Wen's expectations for you.</p><h2>Where to find the cache at Marano Station in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Market Correction takes place in the Buried City map. You won't need to extract to complete the quest, so feel free to load in using a Free Loadout if you're worried you might not make it back alive.</p><p>Your destination is Marano Station, which is located on the northwestern side of the map in the Outskirts area. This whole side of the map is filled with debris and walls for cover, so you can sneak your way into Marano Station without too many worries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469" data-ratio="0.56110434429557" data-width="2463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596469"></a><figcaption>Marano Station is located in the northwestern corner of Buried City.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596469-arcraiders_20251103203704.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll be looking for a set of canisters against a wall at the station. There are two different sets of these near each other, but you need to visit the ones in the north. </p><p>When you've discovered the correct canisters at Marano Station, interact with them once to identify the cache. Afterward, interact with them a second time to sabotage the cache. Doing so will complete the quest for Tian Wen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596472"></a><figcaption>You'll find the cache in the canisters here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596472-arcraiders_20251103203717.jpg"></figure><p>You're now free to extract (or die trying). The Northern Station beside the nearby Library is likely to be your best bet. Passing through this point of interest will let you do some looting, too, which isn't a bad idea given that you may be using a Free Loadout and don't have much to lose by running into aggressive raiders.</p><p>If you're curious about what else is coming up, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-full-quest-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">every quest in Arc Raiders</a>.</p>

But there's a bit more to the game than just survival, as there are also a variety of quests to complete that can provide you with resources that will help you on your journey through Speranza. Below, we've listed out every quest you can undertake in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Arc Raiders missions list</h2><p>There are currently 63 quests in Arc Raiders, though more will be added with future updates. As of right now, you can expect to spend dozens of hours completing these quests, which task you with finding spots on the map to interact with, looting unique resources to return safely to someone in Speranza, or defeating specific enemy types.</p>

<p>Every quest is accepted by speaking to Traders in Speranza, and they'll need to be turned in after completion to receive any rewards.
