                <p>Plans are underway to resurrect Saints Row, as the design director for the first game, Chris Stockman, has revealed that he's working on a pitch for a new entry in the open-world franchise that will see it return to its roots.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saints Row Reddit</a>, Stockman said that he had been approached to work on a proposal, which if successful, could be a prequel. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel. I can't say anything more than that, but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams," Stockman said, while adding that it won't be a VR game that's being pitched.</p><p>In a follow-up with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Stockman added that he's "attempting to get the band back together" to work on the game. "I want to bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots. As you know, I directed Saints Row, and I feel the series has strayed way too far away from that. I completely understand why they went that way, but in the end, they kind of painted themselves into a corner they couldn't get out of," Stockman said.</p><p>This doesn't mean that Saints Row is definitely coming back, as preparing a pitch and getting it successfully approved are two different things. Former Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/">how challenging the process for getting a new game greenlit and funded</a> can be, but that hasn't stopped him from "making calls" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-is-making-calls-about-dead-space-4/1100-6535502/">to get Dead Space 4 approved</a> now that its parent company, EA, is planning to go private <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1759585329081000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2szcV0REzdK1C9jkN7v2Qz">as part of a pending $55 billion deal</a>.</p><p>Released in 2022, Saints Row would be the final game produced by Volition before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/">the studio was closed down in 2023</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-launch-didnt-go-to-plan-embracer-ceo-still-confident-it-will-turn-profit/1100-6507733/">Embracer Group labeled it </a><span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-launch-didnt-go-to-plan-embracer-ceo-still-confident-it-will-turn-profit/1100-6507733/">a commercial flop</a>, and, critically, the game received</span> mixed reviews. In the aftermath of Volition's closure, Saber Interactive founder Matthew Karch remarked that the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-games-were-too-expensive-for-what-they-were-exec-says/1100-6530167/">had gotten too expensive to maintain</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has embraced the ex-boxer meme for its latest Xbox advert, as the company continues with its "this is an Xbox" marketing campaign. Featuring a self-proclaimed ex-boxer, the bizarre advert also spotlighted the new dedicated hardware that recently joined the Xbox family, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVxFfe09-6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qVxFfe09-6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This year has seen Microsoft focus more on the idea of an Xbox ecosystem--rather than on the idea of dedicated Xbox hardware--as it continues work on its next-gen plans for the brand. Recently, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">how Microsoft is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem</a> across multiple devices in the future, hinting at multiple devices and options.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said in August.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has also suggested that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-hints-next-xbox-could-be-like-a-pc/1100-6535797/">next Xbox could be more like a PC</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">and the company is once again partnering with AMD</a> to help build its gaming hardware. While Microsoft has rolled out some flashy marketing for its gaming division, the year has also been rocky for it due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">game cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">studio closures</a>.</p><p>A recent report says that Microsoft has also set astronomically high profit goals for its studios, and recent months have seen it once again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">raise the price of its Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games' former VP of creative, Dan Houser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/" data-ref-id="1100-6473383">left the company in 2020</a>, but he's still a wellspring of knowledge about Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, both of which he was a lead writer on. Houser recently shared his insights into both game series as well as a few of Rockstar's unrealized projects.</p><p>During a nearly three-hour interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lex Fridman on YouTube</a>, Houser touched GTA 5's uncompleted DLC that would have featured Trevor as a secret agent.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o3gbXDjNWyI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It never quite came together, and it was never finished," recalled Houser. "It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, [we] probably wouldn't have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there's always compromises ... I like making the stories. For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would've personally liked to have done more of that in that company."</p><p>Houser related that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rockstars-gta-follow-up-agent-was-canceled-according-to-former-dev/1100-6519489/" data-ref-id="1100-6519489">James Bond-style game called Agent was also in development</a>, but the team couldn't get the idea to work in an open-world environment without sacrificing the rising tension of a spy thriller. He added that the team hadn't even set a time period or a story before the project was shut down. Similarly, a Rockstar game about Knights in medieval times didn't make it out of development.</p><p>"[We were] sort of trying to do a version of a mythological game that could have been fun," said Houser. "And you know, [I] still love that idea, but never went very far with it. Knights would be going really far back in history ... It never got to writing any of it. Just did some backstory and played around with a few ideas. But it was always something I thought I would never do, and then kind of fell in love with it a little bit."</p><p>Fridman also asked about two of the enduring mysteries from the Red Dead Redemption games: The man looking for his friend Gavin, and the shadowy individual who knew John's actions. Houser explained that the Gavin story wasn't supposed to have a resolution before sharing this theory on the shadow man.</p><p>"He was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your shadow, your karma, the devil, somewhere," said Houser. "And then we built out his backstory over time ... And so in Red Dead 2, you could interact with him again and. .. or not really interact with him. But he was there and he was meant to be something I suppose any creative is scared of, an artist who's kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself. He knows what you're up to. What's never really made clear is, does he know this about everybody? Like, is he following you, or is he able, because of the pact he's made with evil forces, able to do this for everybody? I don't think we necessarily ever clarify that. He's certainly able to do it for you."</p><p>Although Houser wasn't involved in the creation of GTA 6, he has no doubt it will break records upon its debut.</p><p>"I would assume it will because it's so anticipated, and anticipation is the best driver of early sales, as we saw with GTA 4 versus Red Dead Redemption 1," added Houser. "You know, GTA 4 far more anticipated, sold much better early on. So I would assume [GTA 6] will sell really well. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted to make money. "</p><p>Houser recently released a novel, A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath, which is now available <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-a-better-paradise-video-game-novel-grand-theft-auto-writer/1100-6532850/" data-ref-id="1100-6532850">on Amazon</a>.</p>

                <p>Back in 2005, rumors swirled of a Halo MMO in development with Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios. The project came to an abrupt end in 2008 when Microsoft shuttered the studio, however one of the developers on the MMO has spilled the beans on the lost game--and why it was cancelled.</p><p>Sandy Peterson, known for his work on the Call of Cthulu TTRPG and Doom before he moved to Ensemble, has posted a <a href="https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread on X</a> with his recollections about the doomed Halo MMO, which was codenamed Titan. He says that he was in charge of the universe-building for the project, which was going to be set in the far past before the Halos destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.</p>

      </div>
<p>"The lowest estimate we &amp; Microsoft had for the game's total income was $1.1 billion," Peterson claims. Earlier reports about the cancelled MMO backed up Microsoft's early commitment to the ambitious project, saying that Titan had been allocated a massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmorpg-had-90-million-budget-pre-cancellation/1100-6257799/" data-ref-id="1100-6257799">$90 million budget</a>.</p><p>According to Petersen, the problem arose when Don Mattrick, who was promoted to head of Xbox in 2007, "realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years." This timing was problematic for Titan, which Petersen said was estimated at the time to need 3.5 years to finish properly.</p><p>"And that’s beyond Mattrick's drop dead date," Petersen concludes. "So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn't have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn't care about Titan." Petersen doesn't say whether he saw proof that this was the case, or if this is just his read on the situation, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmorpg-had-90-million-budget-pre-cancellation/1100-6257799/" data-ref-id="1100-6257799">earlier reports</a> on Ensemble's closure also noted office politics as one of the main factors in the studio's demise.</p><p>Mattrick's reign at Xbox was largely an unpopular one with fans, with the exec presiding over the Kinect, the much-maligned dashboard redesign, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-changing-xbox-one-policies/1100-6410472/" data-ref-id="1100-6410472">disastrous launch</a> of the Xbox One. "All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made," Petersen added on the Ensemble closure. "I don't believe he did justice to Microsoft stockholders but hey - Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?"</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The mode still comes with some restrictions, meaning players won't be able to earn Dogtags or Accolades through Casual Breakthrough, and the mode also won't be reflected in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-check-your-stats-in-battlefield-6/1100-6533934/" data-ref-id="1100-6533934">career stats</a>. XP gain will be weighted, with player actions granting full XP, and bot actions only granting reduced XP.</p><p>For now the mode will include two maps, Siege of Cairo and Empire State. Casual Breakthrough is live now, and can be found under the Multiplayer tab in the main menu. Battlefield Studios has invited players to weigh in on the new mode, adding that it will be "monitoring your feedback to determine if further adjustments are needed in the future."</p><p>While players can also play against bots in Battlefield Portal, the studio ended up disabling progression on bot-enabled servers after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">internal data showed</a> that a large number of Portal servers were set up primarily as XP farms. Casual Breakthrough looks like Battlefield Studio's attempt to fill that gap for players who aren't ready for the full PvP experience, but still want to earn progression.</p><p>Battlefield recently received a major new game mode in the form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-red-sec-is-free-to-play-battle-royale-launches-october-28/1100-6535731/" data-ref-id="1100-6535731">Battlefield Redsec</a>, a battle royale mode that is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-with-or-without-battlefield-6/1100-6535767/" data-ref-id="1100-6535767">available as a standalone experience</a> for players who don't own Battlefield 6.</p>
